Big title after big title, a brand new console in the Switch 2, and a new GOTY contender almost every other week. It's been breathless, but not without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-it-bother-you-that-big-games-companies-are-using-genai">industry struggles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">mass layoffs</a>, cancellations, and closures.</p>
<p>Which is why now, more than ever, it's important to shout out those smaller titles, those games that go a little more under the radar in a jam-packed release calendar. And 2025 has been incredible for independent games and smaller studios, with many of the year's best titles coming from those corners. Some of those are part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our big Staff GOTY list</a>, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hpsqvx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>But, as we've done for the past few years, we want to shine a light on some of the games we've played and loved, that came oh-so-close to making our Game of the Year list and still deserve attention. So here are our picks for the hidden gems that launched on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong> (and there's a poll at the end to pick your favourite).</p>
<p><em>NL staff key: Alana Hagues (AH), Jim Norman (JN), Ollie Reynolds (OR), PJ O'Reilly (PJ)</em></p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Team Ladybug does not miss, yet the developer's games are consistently overlooked, in my eyes. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera</a> is once again adorned with the studio's signature beautiful pixel art visuals with a pure combat-focused adventure. It's Metroidvania, yes, but one with guns, swords, lasers, and other futuristic sci-fi weapons where fighting and movement are king. This isn't a game about secrets — it's a game about fun.</p>
<p>2025 has been a banner year for the Metroidvania genre, but Blade Chimera's early release this year shouldn't discount it from the conversation. It should be right up there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I had heard next to nothing about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet</a> before I accidentally stumbled across it on the Switch 2 eShop. This co-op-only adventure game sounded ripe for some GameChat goodness and, playing through it with site editor Gavin (my fellow space explorer), it proved to be just that.</p>
<p>There were neat two-screen puzzles and platforming challenges that led to some good laughs, but what surprised me the most was its screen-specific story beats, where each of us was left with important bits of information that the other didn’t know. It’s a fantastic conceit, one that threw up more than a few surprises for the big finale, and it made me want to play the whole thing all over again from the other perspective.</p>
<p>A Hazelight joint it ain’t, but it’s a great excuse to see GameChat in action. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was... (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Taisuke Kanasaki has been the art director on some beautiful cult classics over the years — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> have basically cemented him as a legend among DS fans — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was</a> can easily sit among these.</p>
<p>It's only an hour long, but Dear Me, I was is beautiful; a wordless story told with stunning rotoscoping that will make you think about life and art in new ways. It's simple, effective, and the tearjerker you should absolutely try if you love narrative-driven games or art. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Having been desperate to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> ever since its reveal in 2022, I'm so glad Necrosoft Games got it over the finish line in 2025. Sure, it might seem like a tactical RPG twist on <strong>Persona</strong> school-life elements, but it's actually a fair bit different from Atlus' series. And the gameplay isn't built around traditional stat building, instead feeling like a chain of puzzles you have to solve to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>It certainly helps that the cast is loud, proud, and incredibly out there, like a bunch of high-school weirdos that I would've hung out with growing up. Couple this with its love of classic Italian horror cinema, and Demonschool stands out among 2025's strategy RPGs. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>You are Eugene McQuacklin, a duck recovering from a bread addiction, who dons his fedora and trench coat to solve small-town crimes and fend off the ghosts of his recent divorce. If this isn’t a funny image to you, then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_-_the_secret_salami">its predecessor</a>, for that matter) will not be up your street; however, if that idea brought even the smallest smile to your face, then boy, do I have a recommendation for you.</p>
<p>It’s a little on the short side, and some of the ‘Deducktions’ are rather trial-and-error-y, but Ghost of Glamping is one of the cosiest, funniest mysteries that you will have tackled in a good long time. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I'll be honest, I never even considered the idea that a game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a> could work as a Metroidvania, but that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood</a> has accomplished with its BMX-inspired exploration gameplay.</p>
<p>Despite its colourful, cartoony visuals, Laika is a sombre experience that absolutely isn't intended for younger audiences. It's brutal, with graphic scenes of violence, potty-mouth protagonists, and punishing difficulty to boot. It's all worth it for that sublime soundtrack, though – you won't hear anything else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Monster-catching roguelites aren't exactly new, but what if they were utterly disgusting? That's a very reductive breakdown of what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> is, a messy game that's overstimulating with every second. You'll die multiple times without knowing what hit you, start again and try and figure out what you did wrong, only to do something else erroneous.</p>
<p>Morsels is a game about making a mess with a bunch of messy creatures. And it's about navigating through the mess, the visual noise. It's extremely compelling on that front alone — if it's your cup of tea. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As a top-down Zelda fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>'s colourful energy and industrial world enchanted me on its first reveal. Pipistrello loves GBA sprite work and intricately-connected areas, with skills that you gradually unlock to reveal more and more of the map.</p>
<p>And it's that map that makes Pipistrello so good. I love a map that teases you, leaves a carrot dangling for you to come back and chomp when you have the right ability. And it helps that every ability Pippit gets feels useful in some way, whether it's for combat, exploration, or just <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Pocket Trap has made an excellent adventure here — which includes an actual in-game GBA-type machine — and I really hope more people pick the game up. - <em>AH</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Who thought we'd be putting Brace Yourself Games' latest title on a list like this? But here we are. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is a completely different take on the rhythmic action that made the Canadian developer famous. This time, it's <strong>Guitar Hero</strong> meets bullet hell. That means this isn't a gentle game, and you'll have to try and try again to defeat each enemy.</p>
<p>When you reach that higher plane and hit all of the notes perfectly, and dodge all of the attacks? That feeling is unmissable. And look, if you need a break, there's even a dash of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/rhythm_heaven">Rhythm Heaven</a> waiting in the form of minigames. Surely that alone should be enough to get all you Switch owners running to own this? - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> is one of those games that folk were telling me to play long before it landed on Switch, and in the end I was sort of glad I waited, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">through reviewing it</a> I got to sit down and properly engross myself in a game that people <em>should</em> really be talking about in the same breath as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>. It really is on that level of world and character-building.</p>
<p>And it's on that level in terms of your choices, and their ramifications for your playthrough, too. It's quite something, and the world here is as interesting as the mostly text-based shenanigans that play out. <em>"Mostly text-based? That sounds like it's for old nerds!"</em> Yes, mate, I get that, but the writing is exquisite, and the whole thing is set to a nerve-y time limit. It requires your best detective skills and the ability to hustle and think on your feet. It also never lets you paint any sort of full picture, so replays aplenty are inbound.</p>
<p>You do want to be a weird <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">Witcher</a> version of those lads from Revachol, right? - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> is the answer to the question, <em>'What if Paper Mario was a mascot platformer from the '90s instead of an RPG?'</em> Chatty and bursting with personality, Ruffy has its very own unique gimmick that is endlessly creative and clever: copying and pasting.</p>
<p>It really is that simple! But it opens up so many puzzle solutions and ideas that the developers cram into every area with glee. Pack in plenty of collectibles and you have a game that would feel right at home on the N64. There's even some rough edges, just like the good ol' days, but we love Ruffy all the more for them. Sometimes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I absolutely adore arcade-inspired games that demand perfection to achieve high scores and achievements, and that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man</a> does. The premise is simple: rid each level of as many enemies as possible while you make your way to the end goal. The twist? Movement is completely tied to the kickback provided by your shotgun (and other weapons) when you fire it.</p>
<p>So while there's definitely a slight learning curve to begin with, Shotgun Cop Man is right up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> as a perfectly tuned platformer that feels unbelievably satisfying to master. It's also hilarious, too! <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> is a survival horror like no other. Swapping out dark, grimy environments for colourful backdrops, it boasts a plethora of incredibly well-realised characters and enemies while introducing an intriguing new form of combat in which you quite literally target the hearts of your foes.</p>
<p>Though I wouldn't necessarily say it's scary in the traditional sense, it's undeniably unsettling, with the juxtaposition of bright, vivid colours and horrific visuals conjuring up a sense of fear that few other games can manage. Better yet, there are optional tank controls for those who, like me, refuse to let the past die. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, there was no way we were going to skip <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, and what an excellent follow-up to a quirky, occultish puzzler. Antiques are the natural follow-up to plants, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, 2025 has been an amazing year for the puzzle genre, and Strange Antiquities is among the best. Yes, it takes the same cosy-ish premise of the original, swapping the green for the old, but it's just as weird — and occasionally sinister — as Horticulture. It's all about reading, studying, and paying attention to the weird and wonderful things you hear about in-game. And the overarching narrative is equally rewarding. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> looked made for Switch when it arrived on PC in May, and the port onto the hybrid five months later proved a great match. Turn-based tactical X Beat ‘em up isn’t a combination that I thought the industry had been crying out for, but good heavens, did Strange Scaffold use it to good effect!</p>
<p>Racking up combos in this table-top-looking world is some of the most satisfying tactical gameplay I've experienced all year. You will never have played a Turtles game quite like this one, and hey, that’s pretty tubular, bro! - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> is exactly how it sounds: you set up a tiny shop and you, well, sell books! It's the epitome of cosy, and the inclusion of real-life books with real authors lends a sense of authenticity to the otherwise quaint, picturesque presentation. Watching the numbers go up as you sell more and more books is so very satisfying, but it never feels like you're pressured to perform well.</p>
<p>If you're after something genuinely relaxing, then I urge you to give this one a shot. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I was really surprised by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a>. Though I expected an experience filled with weird, <strong>Twin Peaks</strong>-inspired goings on — which it certainly has — I didn't quite expect it to feel so relatable and emotional. It perfectly captures the slow, almost monotonous day-to-day experience of high school, but in a way that's constantly engaging with some truly beautiful pixel art visuals.</p>
<p>It's the type of game you'll complete, leave alone for a few years, then play through again once you've forgotten the story. Remarkable stuff. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>2025 is the year when I've fallen more out of love with being online than ever before. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> reminded me that things haven't always been this way. That things were good, and <em>can</em> still be good. The power of online communities, a shared love of video games, and love and acceptance over hate make Videoverse an essential, humanistic experience for anyone who loves games, writing, and who grew up in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>We had to wait a few years to get this on Switch, but I'm glad we finally got it. - <em>AH</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> fans will have a very Merry Christmas this year, as Sega will be launching the free 'NiGHTS DLC Pack' this week on Christmas Eve – that's <strong>24th December 2025</strong>, just to make it crystal clear.</p>
<p>The pack will include NiGHTS as a playable character, the Dream Sleeper vehicle, and new emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>The character originally appeared in <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/nights_into_dreams">NiGHTS into Dreams</a> for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The release of the DLC on Christmas Eve appears to be a direct nod to <strong>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams</strong>, a promotional sampler disc that released in the festive period of 1996.</p>
<p>There are even more free characters on the way too, with AiAi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball</a> expected to drop in January, followed by Tangle and Whisper in February.</p>
<p>If you've purchased the additional Season Pass, you can also enjoy characters such as Spongebob Squarepants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>'s Steve, with <strong>Pac-Man</strong> racers also expected in January.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for the Switch 2 version of CrossWorlds, we said that "Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects". High praise indeed. It's a good'un, folks.</p>

<p>When the Switch generation was in full swing, there were stories about games being censored in some way or form, and even blocked from being published on the eShop.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems fans of the "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">have spotted a potential cover up</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dispatch-art-and-comics-pack-70050000063187-switch/">Nintendo's digital storefront in the US</a>. The banner for the "Dispatch Art and Comics Pack" DLC is showing much <em>less</em> skin compared to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/aocs/70050000063189">listings in other locations</a> (and even on other digital marketplaces <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/HP7386-PPSA27158_00-0567897799992899/">such as the PlayStation Store</a>).</p>
<p>Here's what is currently displayed on the US store. Below this, you can see the banner for the same DLC on the Nintendo store in Australia.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1d20fe2f74ba9"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1d20fe2f74ba9/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Censored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="79f3c16a242dc"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79f3c16a242dc/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Uncensored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's got a lot of Dispatch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">fans questioning what's going on</a>, with some even pointing the finger at Nintendo. As this does appear to be isolated to a specific location, cases like this can sometimes be tied to local decisions, storefront regulations or classification laws. Of course, it could also be a mistake.</p>
<p>Website Notebookcheck also puts forth some ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo of America may be seeking to maintain a more family-friendly image. It’s also possible that AdHoc Studio submitted the revised digital art without the company’s insistence. Nevertheless, many gamers question why the censorship is appropriate for <em>Dispatch</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's not the first time we've seen changes covering up characters in video games. This also doesn't necessarily mean this will carry over to the full game, but if we do hear any significant developments or findings about possible censorship in the game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been rated by the ESRB as 'Mature 17+' and contains blood, crude humor, intense violence, nudity, sexual content, strong language, and use of drugs and alcohol. It's also got in-game purchases. This game launches for Switch and Switch 2 early next year on 28th January 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d88e9faedd8c2"><a title="Bloober Team" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d88e9faedd8c2/bloober-team.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has recently been busy with the Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, but did you know it's got one other mysterious Nintendo release in the pipeline?</p>
<p>In case you missed it, in July last year, the Polish-based horror developer teased it was working on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">new project specifically for Nintendo platforms</a> known as '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">Project M</a></strong>'. Now, in a new interview with Nintendo Insider, the studio's CEO Piotr Babieno has revealed that the first details about this title could be shared "very soon".</p>
<p>To add to this, this new game apparently has a "bold twist" which is part of a "vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware". Fans of titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, the indie game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and iconic video game horror series should feel right at home here. Below is the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While the title hasn’t been announced, can you go into what players should expect from Project M, the Nintendo platform exclusive horror title from Bloober?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piotr Babieno:</strong> "You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon.</p>
<p>"What I can say is this: fans of <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Limbo</em>, and <em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When details about 'Project M' originally surfaced last year, it was described as having a budget "significantly smaller" than the company's usual projects, and is a game being developed "in cooperation with the world's best creators for Nintendo platforms".</p>
<p>In the same interview, Babieno also acknowledged the "incredible" support from the team at Nintendo, mentioning how Nintendo's "trust" has guided and empowered Bloober.</p>

<p>We noted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">in our review here on Nintendo Life</a> how the "biggest drawback" of P3R when it launched in October on the new hybrid system was the 30fps performance. Thankfully, the latest update (<strong>Version 1.03</strong>) comes with <em>some</em> performance improvements.</p>
<p>Most notably, it bumps the docked version of the game up to 60fps when it's running in performance mode. The frame rate stability across the docked and handheld modes has also been improved, and Atlus notes how it will be rolling out a patch for the demo in the "coming days". Here's the full rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="nhkdyt-h_Eo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnhkdyt-h_Eo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5e7948ripnvx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<h3>Persona 3 Reload - Nintendo Switch 2 Version 1.03 Update (December 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03 patch notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</em></li>
<li><em>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</em></li>
<li><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 patch update for the free demo will take place in the coming days (exact time TBD)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Once again, you can find out more about Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2 in our review here on Nintendo Life, and the demo is available to download from the eShop.</p>
<p>Although we wanted more from the game's performance when we first looked at P3R on the Switch 2, we still enjoyed the overall experience, calling it an "extensive and thoughtful remake of the original and unquestionably the best way" to play this modern RPG classic.</p>
