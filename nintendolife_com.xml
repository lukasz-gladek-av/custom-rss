<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159532/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Before spinning us an enchanting and emotionally charged yarn, developer Little Sewing Machine opens with a simple dedication in lowercase: <em>for mom</em>. It’s a reminder that, despite the scope of the journey ahead, this is a deeply personal tale.</p>
<p>Little Sewing Machine lead Chris Darill is no stranger to artistic horror or cinematic flair. His <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Aremothered"><strong>Remothered</strong></a> games were standout examples of survival horror done right. Here, he introduces us to a disarming world of primary colours and art that feels straight out of Disney, before plunging us into a nightmare filled with tricky puzzles and shadowy monsters.</p>
<p>Lana Benton lives a bleak life of toil at Bunny Hall Orphanage. Her only solace was her friend Carole, who has gone missing under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by nightmares of a tall figure in a top hat, Lana sets out to find her friend. In doing so, she stumbles into the world of Corolla, where strange creatures roam and the sinister Mr. Kyn, the man from her dreams, relentlessly pursues her.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159535/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with its art style, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a> unfolds like a classic Disney tale. A downtrodden heroine, who can speak to birds and is frequently called “princess” by fantastical creatures, moves from a bleak earthly existence to a strange alternate realm in search of a loved one. Personal struggles are overcome, and emotional lessons are learned. There's even an omniscient narrator that chimes in occasionally to exposit and vocalise the hero's internal trauma.</p>
<p>The writing has welcome cultural complexity. Bunny Hall is an oppressive institution that reinforces distorted gender dynamics. These story elements are well illustrated and underscore the importance of the central relationship.</p>
<p>The mechanics of Lana's adventure are as traditional as its story. Essentially a side-scrolling puzzle adventure, it plays out like an old-school point-and-click, with some added QTEs and punishing trial-and-error encounters.</p>
<p>Early on, Lana gains the ability to transform into a rabbit, unlocking wall jumping and new traversal options. The alternate Bunny Hall also features grotesque versions of authority figures that our princess must run or hide from in tense, though often clunky, stealth sections.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159539/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hiding in dark spaces, holding your breath, and trying not to get caught by a twisted rabbit creature evokes the gothic chills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>. However, unlike the quick death that awaits in that Burtonesque classic, Bye Sweet Carole’s has a health bar that encourages multiple attempts at hide and seek. Character animations don’t always allow for a smooth escape once you’re discovered. Lana can switch between human and rabbit form to navigate obstacles, but these moments can still feel like frustrating exercises in trial and error.</p>
<p>There’s some light combat, where you take control of the mysterious protector Mr. Baesie. It fares a bit better than the stealth encounters but still feels somewhat fiddly. That said, an empowering final battle is thoroughly enjoyable, but I won’t spoil that here. The lavishly animated challenges are not as punishing as the visually similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragons_lair_trilogy">Dragon’s Lair</a> (Don Bluth rather than Disney), yet there are times when Lana simply has to die before you can figure out the solution.</p>
<p>The rest of the time is spent travelling between screens, collecting various ephemera to clear obstacles or open doors. There’s some very light platforming and frequent chase encounters with Mr. Kyn and his minions.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159538/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s worth pushing through the rough patches to continue Lana’s search for her friend. Using a familiar yet distinctive aesthetic to tell such a personal and occasionally bleak story is effective. The visuals are complemented further by a beautiful score from composer Luca Balboni, which makes even the simple act of retracing your steps through loading screens feel grandiose.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the art style doesn’t always mesh perfectly with movement and combat, but that doesn’t take away from its beauty on either a big or small screen. Aside from a fair bit of loading between areas, the game performs well on the Switch, with smooth, fluid animation, especially when Lana is darting around in rabbit form.</p>
<p>Undocked Switch 2 performance feels mostly the same as on Switch 1, though the visuals stand out far more on the newer console’s larger handheld display. Undocked play is a much more viable option on the Switch 2, but Bye Sweet Carole performs well across both platforms.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfolding like a classic Disney tale, this is a beautifully animated adventure that weaves a deeply personal tale. Bye Sweet Carole is driven by its art style and a brilliant musical score, but occasionally stumbles due to stiff controls and frustrating mechanics.</p></section>

<p>End of an era</p>

<figure data-uuid="4a192ba2ca07a"><a title="Banjo-Kazooie - Smash" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a192ba2ca07a/banjo-kazooie-smash.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you enjoy Rare's games, then chances are you ought to be thanking Gregg Mayles, a UK-based game designer who not only directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> and its Xbox-only follow-up <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/banjo-kazooie_nuts_and_bolts">Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>, but also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/battletoads">Battletoads</a>, and more.</p>
<p>He was a big deal at the studio, and now after 36 years, he's left for pastures new.</p>
<p>Yes, after Microsoft unceremoniously cancelled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a>, Mayles decided it was perhaps time to move on, and has now posted a farewell message on social media with his very own poem (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/thanks-to-everyone-who-played-donkey-kong-country-and-banjo-kazooie-designer-gregg-mayles-leaves-rare-after-36-years">Time Extension</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Alongside the aforementioned titles, Mayles also directed the wildly popular <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> which, after its initial launch in 2018, found an additional home on the PS5 in April 2024. Many thought that perhaps Microsoft was also planning a launch on Switch, but alas, this has yet to come to fruition.</p>
<p>In addition to the cancellation of Everwild, Microsoft also pulled the plug on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a>, a planned reboot of the N64 classic from Rare. In development by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, the former was also shuttered as part of the cancellation. Boo.</p>

<p>So much tat!</p>

Well, you should be, it's bloomin' great. If you <em>are</em>, then you might be keen to check out a new upcoming physical edition from <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/search?q=wolfenstein&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">Limited Run Games</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders open on <strong>17th October 2025 and close on 16th November 2025</strong>, and you can choose between three available SKUs: Standard, Steelbook, and Collector's Edition.</p>
<p>The latter, priced at <strong>$134.99</strong>, has a boatload of tat included that we suspect only the most passionate of fans will be interested in. This includes:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wvpoui&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Wolfenstein II®: The New Colossus™ Game</li>
<li>SteelBook</li>
<li>Slipcase</li>
<li>Original Soundtrack</li>
<li>USB Floppy Drive</li>
<li>BJ Blaskowicz &amp; Supersoldat Action Figures</li>
<li>Star Card Set (52 Count)</li>
<li>Replica Album Covers</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, you read that right, action figures! Now little Timmy can recreate the infamous beheading scene while you play. Or maybe not... You'd need a Frau Engel figure, at least.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8e66b8576f49"><a title="Wolfenstein II - Collector's" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8e66b8576f49/wolfenstein-ii-collectors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, it all looks pretty cool, but we're particularly enamoured with the steelbook – it looks really nice! If you feel similar, then its <strong>$69.99</strong> price tag might sound more tempting. Alternatively, if you're fussed about any extras and just want the physical game, this will set you back <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein II originally released on the Switch back in 2018 and wound up being one of the stronger ports for the console. We highlighted its "brilliantly-written story and intense action" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus">8/10 review</a>, so we think it's well worth checking out.</p>
