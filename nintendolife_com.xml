<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is coming to Switch 2 only, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</a> is lined up for both Switch 1 and 2 - and Square Enix has confirmed there'll be no way to upgrade a Switch 1 version of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3lvbhnvp7ys2m">Posting on Bluesky</a>, the publisher says that if you buy the Switch 1 version, you won't be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version via an Upgrade Pack. This means Switch 2 owners wanting a physical copy of the game will be stuck between Switch 1 cart they can't upgrade and a Game-Key Card which — according to the official box art — will require a 5GB download.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uimnjv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Note about the Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch versions 1/2]<br>
The Switch 2 versions (both the physical and digital versions) can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
[2/2]<br>
It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other publishers have offered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">Upgrade Packs</a> that let anyone with the Switch 1 game get the upgraded version of the game on the more powerful console but, for whatever reason, Square apparently has no interest in offering this as an option.</p>
<p>As a reminder for anybody out of the loop, Nintendo introduced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a> as an option for publishers on Switch 2. They don't contain any game data, with the cart acting — as the name suggests — as a key that must be inserted in the console, first to download the entire game from the eShop, and subsequently to access the game on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While this means that publishers can get a 'physical' product on store shelves and you have something to put on your own shelf (or resell, if you like), you'll still need to have the game downloaded and taking up storage space on your system - and you'll need the card inserted to play it.</p>
<p>Players' reaction to Game-Key Cards from players has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">largely negative</a>, although the option to get a physical copy of the Switch 1 game and then get the digital-only Upgrade Pack for Switch 2 was a compromise some were prepared to make. Zero chance of that here, it seems.</p>
<p>The game's not out until December, so it's possible plans could change. "Please make sure you purchase the correct version" doesn't sound promising, though.</p>

<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>
<p>And hey, if previews are anything to go by, this looks pretty solid; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">IGN</a>, <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145273/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">Shacknews</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-2-hours-with-the-silent-hill-2-devs-slimy-sci-fi-beast-cronos-im-thrilled-it-has-dead-space-dna-and-the-soul-of-resident-evil-this-is-more-like-a-love-letter-to-survival-horror-than-to-poland/">Gamesradar</a> all have good things to say.</p>

<figure><a title="Gulikit Elves 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95e9d6a81fb88/gulikit-elves-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gulikit has announced the 'Elves 2', a new wireless controller for the Switch and Switch 2 touted as the first third-party controller to offer 'wake-up' support for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Available in Coral Red and Translucent Black, the Elves 2 is a different proposition from its 'Pro' variant, (which is already available - you can check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">full review for all the details</a>). The new model is missing a few key features, such as APG recording and custom thumbstick sensitivity, but it's still got gyro support, three levels of rumble intensity, and those all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with removable caps.</p>
<p>The Elves 2 is priced at $29.99 and is available from Amazon now in the US and Japan, with Europe to follow "soon". Select global retailers will also offer the pad, though pricing may vary depending on region.</p>
<p>"We’re proud to be the first controller brand globally to support wake-up functionality on the Switch 2 at launch," said Gulikit in its press release.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the pad's key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Retro-Inspired Ergonomics:</strong><br>
Shaped after the Sega Genesis controller for comfortable, fatigue-free play. Compact and lightweight for gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong>- World-First Switch 2 Wake-Up Support:<br></strong>Instantly wake up your Switch 2 from sleep mode—GuliKit is the first controller brand to offer this feature out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>- Dual Hall Effect Joysticks:<br></strong>Drift-free performance with 2200-level high precision and long-lasting durability.</p>
<p><strong>- Advanced Haptics with Asymmetric Dual-Rotor Motors:</strong><strong><br></strong>Three levels of responsive vibration feedback for immersive gameplay, similar to Xbox's tactile feel.</p>
<p><strong>- Universal Compatibility:<br></strong>Works seamlessly with Switch 2, Switch, Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p><strong>- Classic Floating D-Pad:<br></strong>Perfect for fighting games, with precise actuation and fast combo execution.</p>
<p><strong>- Pro-Level Input:<br></strong> Tactile triggers and silent conductive rubber buttons for fast, responsive, and comfortable control.</p>
<p><strong>- Wired &amp; Wireless Modes:<br></strong>Choose between Bluetooth (730Hz polling rate) or wired (1000Hz) connections for ultra-low latency.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
