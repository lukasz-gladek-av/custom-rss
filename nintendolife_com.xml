<p>New features also get a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>

<p>Sneaky...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Ubisoft have finally confirmed the world's worst-kept secret: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is launching on the Switch 2 on 2nd December 2025. Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Silver Bullet (Switch) - A Gothic Arcade Shooter Full Of Tricks]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/silver-bullet</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-silver-bullet-switch-a-gothic-arcade-shooter-full-of-tricks.1332994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/silver_bullet">Silver Bullet</a>’s aesthetic is dark, cartoony, and full of Halloween charm. But beneath its playful premise of a pint-sized Van Helsing rescuing puppies from the forces of darkness lies a razor-blade-stuffed apple - an arcade game with a wicked edge.</p>
<p>Mashing genres into something unique, its crosshair shooting setup is reminiscent of Cabal or Wild Guns, but eradicates ambiguous pseudo-3D trajectories by flattening everything onto a pure 2D plane. You trace your crosshair about the screen to gun down ghouls and dash to avoid bullets, while giant bosses - everything from fiery skeletons to undead dinosaurs - rain down fun and fearsome bullet hell-style patterns that are both inventive and thrilling to work through.</p>
<p>Helsing has a regularly refilled super attack that can be aimed and fired in a straight line, bleeding point icons as it wipes out enemies, and a close-encounters button-tap parry for expert use. His dash manoeuvre can also destroy enemies and certain obstacles, essential for tidying cluttered screens.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: don’t die and make your super shots count. Fine-tuned for scoring, each stage is plumbed with tricks to propel you up the leaderboards, with an accuracy meter that rises when hitting an object, multiplying your points, and falling when firing on dead air. A death, however, cuts this right down. Coins can be teased from each stage to be spent in a shop, doubling your super usage and improving accuracy, amongst other effects, implemented to incrementally improve your chances.</p>
<p>There are six stages and six interim, viciously creative bonus games that are frankly very tough to crack, borrowing ideas from Namco’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/point_blank">Point Blank</a> and Capcom’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/pang">Pang</a>, amongst others. There’s a challenging score attack mode and a novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a> shooting-hybrid called Terror Blocks to unlock, with a unique scoring system all its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about points, continues are freely available to get you through the game. At only 35 minutes in length, however, Silver Bullet shines brightest when you attempt a one-credit clear, and it's meticulously engineered around this. Extra lives appear at certain waypoints, and pocketing coins to rapidly empty the shop is a smart approach. Challenging though it is, the reward for success is all the more elating. This is owed largely to a clever arrangement that, once understood, keeps drawing you back for another go.</p>
<p>Yet, there are a few frustrations. It's occasionally difficult to discern which objects you can safely dash through, and positioning with walk or dash isn't entirely foolproof. Silver Bullet’s most prominent foible, though, is its control dilemma. Designed around a twin-stick setup - one for Helsing’s movement and the other for crosshair positioning - it's awkward to have button work restricted to the shoulders and triggers. Switching to traditional controls is far more comfortable, but then you can’t move the crosshair independently unless you’re firing at the same time. This negatively impacts your accuracy and, in turn, your scoring.</p>
<p>It’s not a colossal problem, and casual gamers will have a great time with its cleverly devised stages, but those aiming to play as intended face a tough choice: master the twin-stick controls or accept reduced scoring potential in favour of a more intuitive experience. It's a thorny choice, but regardless of how you choose to play, Silver Bullet is a bewitchingly fun little Halloween title that will have arcade enthusiasts howling at the moon.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/silver-bullet]]></content:encoded>
