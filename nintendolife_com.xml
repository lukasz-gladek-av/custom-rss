<p>Another year, another Geoff</p>
</section></header><section>
<p>Okay, okay, we know you're incredibly busy right now playing the Switch 2. We understand, and it's all good.</p>
<p><em>However</em>. If you're interested in what this year's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase has to offer, then you've come to the right place. We're streaming the event live right here when it all kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PDT / 3pm MDT / 4pm CDT / 5pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CEST / 12am (Sat) EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 6am (Sat) JST / 5am (Sat) AWST / 7am (Sat) AEST</li></ul>

<p>As for what might be announced, well... we don't really know right now. A lot of focus seems to be on Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> for the PS5, so we're fully expecting Geoff Keighley and Kojima to spend a good 10-15 minutes doing some sort of secret handshake on-stage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a whole bunch of partners has been confirmed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-switch-2-listed-as-a-summer-game-fest-2025-partner">including 'Nintendo Switch 2'</a>, so it's likely we'll see a few notable announcements for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>So grab a snack, settle in, and enjoy... Or go back to playing Switch 2, whatever you want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Pro Controller 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37abd35a25ad0/pro-controller-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Moving from the Switch 1 Pro Controller to the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Nintendo has largely taken the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ route. Keeping the same basic layout intact, it instead applied several small, but significant improvements to make this latest iteration the very best Nintendo controller I’ve ever had the pleasure of using.</p>
<p>So, looking at the design of the new pad, it all looks pretty familiar, but there are a few changes that should be noted.</p>
<p>For starters, the grips are ever-so-slightly slimmer than the previous model, which in my case made it much more comfortable in the hand. My index fingers rest perfectly on the ‘ZL’ and ‘ZR’ triggers, while the rest of my fingers fall naturally on the grips below. As for the general feel, the matt black/grey finish is wonderful, though it does invite plenty of dust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the face buttons have been slightly enlarged; not so much that it’s immediately noticeable by sight, but you can really feel the difference in the hand. They’re close enough together that your thumb essentially rests on two buttons at once diagonally, making it easy to rock back and forth to hit whichever one you want.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest improvement comes with those analogue sticks. Good <em>lord</em>, they feel incredible. The standard Joy-Con controllers have been improved in a similar way, with the sticks feeling much smoother than on the Switch 1. With the Pro Controller, this is far more pronounced thanks to the extra travel afforded by the larger sticks.</p>
<p>It’s so difficult to describe exactly how smooth the motion feels; it’s one of those things where if you know, you <em>know</em>. That said, if you want a bit of a fun attempt at a rundown, then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olJH2tQgREE">Alex’s video</a>, in which he demonstrates with a bottle and an oily spoon. (Look, just trust me). Rest assured, the slight grinding you'd feel on the original Pro Controller is now completely gone.</p>
<p>Moving onto the D-pad, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/18ztfbf/holy_crap_the_pro_controllers_dpad_is_horrible/">sensitivity issues some people had</a> with the Switch 1 Pro Controller appear to have been fixed here, though we’ll need to really put it through its paces over the coming months (and years) to see if it holds up.</p>

<p>Testing the D-pad within the calibration settings reveals that rocking it up and down while holding down left or right does still yield ‘up’ and ‘down’ inputs, but it’s not nearly as sensitive as the previous controller. In fact, you want it to happen a <em>bit</em> so you can easily pull off diagonal inputs. Playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was easily able to knock out a few combos and Hadoukens without any fuss, and retro games via Nintendo Switch Online felt similarly natural with the D-pad.</p>
<p>Over on the back, you’ve also got the new ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons, which can be remapped to whatever you wish on a game-by-game basis. We’ve already noted that you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-got-a-switch-2-pro-controller-this-little-capture-trick-is-a-game-changer">map the capture button to the back</a>, which is a bit of a game-changer for more fast-paced games in which you want to take a few snaps.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can map whatever input you wish, so it can certainly come in handy when you want to sprint and jump at the same time in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, for example.</p>
<figure><a title="Pro Controller 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8798e564fe271/pro-controller-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The positioning of the back buttons feels pretty natural, too. I mentioned that my fingers rested comfortably on the grips, and this is exactly where ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ are placed, but if you’re worried about accidentally pressing them, fear not. You can comfortably move your middle fingers up slightly to rest on the back of the pad – pretty much right where the ‘Nintendo’ logo is located. But even this isn’t entirely necessary in my opinion; my fingers curve around the buttons enough that I don’t feel they’re ever going to be pressed unless I consciously want to.</p>
<p>The dinky face buttons — i.e. your home button, capture button, '+', '–', and GameChat button — are all tucked away quite neatly in the middle of the device. The capture button specifically could be in a <em>slightly</em> easier-to-reach location, but it's at least out of the way enough that you're probably never going to hit it accidentally.</p>
<p>With the 'C' button, it's the same deal. You know where it is, so it's easily reachable whenever you want to access the Switch 2's GameChat menu, but you need to consciously reach your thumb over to get at it. What's odd is that, thanks to the right analogue stick next to it, the GameChat button looks slightly off-centre. It's not — you can tell by looking at its positioning in relation to the home and capture buttons above — but next to the analogue stick, it looks a little... weird.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the other big change with the Pro Controller 2 is the addition of a 3.5mm headphone jack - can I get a 'hallelujah!'? Yes, this is a lovely little addition that makes discreet audio an absolute breeze if you happen to be gaming late at night. Something to keep in mind is that you'll need to make sure your controller is fully updated before hooking up a headset - thankfully, the Switch itself lets you know that you're due one if you plug anything into the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Positioning the audio jack at the bottom is just about the best place for it, too. You've got a standard USB-C slot at the top for your charging needs, so you can easily plug in both a headset and a charging cable without much fuss.</p>
<p>Speaking of the top, you'll notice now that the entire area housing the shoulder buttons, USB-C slot, and sync button is now white, as are the 'shafts' for the analogue sticks. This is a nice little design decision that easily sets the new pad apart from its predecessor, but I can also understand if it doesn't appeal to those looking for a more uniform look.</p>
<p>As for the shoulder buttons themselves, these feel nice and clicky without producing too much noise. No analogue functionality for the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons, sadly, but the digital inputs work perfectly well enough. Truth be told, this is probably the one area of the pad that's required the least amount of tinkering from Nintendo, and it all feels just as good as ever.</p>

<p>One last thing to touch on is the HD Rumble 2, which definitely feels a lot more robust than the original Pro Controller (and quieter too), but still not quite on par with the PS5's haptic feedback. It feels really nice, though; moving between menu options on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> produces small, yet welcome feedback, while powersliding during races feels appropriately gnarly without distracting you from the action on-screen.</p>
<p>Really, it's hard to find much fault with it. Time will be the true test, of course, and it certainly isn't cheap. I'll be keeping a close eye on any potential drifting issues or D-pad shenanigans, but after using it as my primary controller for 99% of the time with my Switch 2 thus far, it's proven to be a magical little accessory; a new benchmark in Nintendo controller design. I've not yet tried the PS5's DualSense Edge, but I feel confident in saying that this $85 pad feels better than Xbox's $200 Elite Controller.</p>

<figure><a title="Wind Waker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fb262cb808a5f/wind-waker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest surprises with the Switch 2 is the bonus addition of Nintendo GameCube games for subscribers to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The opening line-up is slightly slim, sure, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> are all absolute bangers.</p>
<p>Some of you may have also picked up the new wireless GameCube controller to go with your new subscriber perk, and it's definitely an incredibly faithful recreation of the original classic. Like previous NSO catalogues, however, using the GameCube controller yields a few fun surprises in the main menu, as seen in the below video from Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akfamilyhome.com/post/3lqukwcsb5c2e">AK</a>.</p>

<p>So when using the controller, the usual red interface will change to purple to match the overall colour scheme of the GameCube, while a bunch of sound effects have also been added in. There are definitely a few we've noticed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It's a neat little easter egg, albeit one that's been done before. Still, it's pretty cool to see that Nintendo still has its sense of fun, even if this isn't immediately apparent with the main Switch 2 UI.</p>

<p>It’s more often than not these days that a game released in an underwhelming state is left abandoned in a pool of its own minor updates. On occasion, though, we have a redemption arc like that belonging to 2020's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>Originally released in a state that was barely functional and riddled with more bugs than an anteater’s digestive tract, it’s safe to say that CD Projekt Red has not only redeemed its reputation, but the game is now celebrated as one of the strongest RPGs of the decade.</p>
<p>Somehow, this goliath of neon violence is now on Nintendo Switch 2 as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, but how does a handheld deal with this phoenix-like, vindicated video game?</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156536/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, firstly, this release comes with some swanky new controls. The most immediately impressive is gyro aiming, not a revolutionary idea by any stretch in 2025, but a hugely welcome addition that can really help with fine adjustments during gunplay. CDPR have also added a swathe of different options on how it can be implemented, adjusting sensitivity, when gyro becomes enabled (for example, only when you’re aiming down sights), and even how much your movements are dampened to avoid twitchy nonsense.</p>
<p>Mouse controls are also an option, but they don’t feel quite as natural and well-realised. The game’s frame rate (more on that to come) limits responsiveness, but this could easily be a limitation of my own experience with mouse controls at lower frame rates; I’m certain there’s <em>someone</em> out there who will wonder how they ever lived without it, and more power to whoever you are. Frankly, I'd always rather have an option available and not use it, than not have it at all.</p>
<p>I did notice some inconsistencies with some actions, though, most notably reloading. For some reason hitting the 'Y' button just didn’t always initiate a reload, to the point that I tested the Joy-Con 2 in the system settings to make sure it wasn’t faulty, but it seems to be entirely specific to this control method. Hopefully this is nothing more than an oversight that can be patched in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156534/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last on the new control methods is ‘Motion Patterns’, a method that uses motion controls not just for aiming, but gestures for reloading, using health items, and more besides. It’s locked behind the T-Bug tutorial from the start of the game, and for good reason. I can only imagine some hapless sod turning it on by mistake and wondering why they’re using up their health items every time they scratch their nose. It’s only available when using two Joy-Con 2 <em>without</em> a grip, Wii Remote and Nunchuk-style, and a fun little distraction for a while, but despite its good reliability and responsiveness, it’s not something I felt any desire to enable outside of testing.</p>
<p>But onto the game itself. You play as V, and much like most RPGs with a custom character creator, V can be anything you want — male, female, young, old (ish) — it’s entirely your call, and the residents of Night City could not care less about any of it. They’ve got their own problems.</p>
<p>V is, however, a criminal to some degree, just like practically everyone else in the city. Law and order exists officially, but gangs roam the streets, taking hostages and murdering civilians without blinking if they think it’ll bag them some Eurodollars, or ‘eddies’.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156541/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the first things you’ll notice upon entering Night City is just how detailed and narratively well-built this fictitious world is; Night City feels like it could actually be a real-life place in many ways; with its blend of ramshackle streets and ultra-wealthy districts, it's shockingly believable. Culture, fashion, technology, language, it all feels like looking at a warped reflection of our own world, frighteningly well-realised, and terrifyingly bleak in so many ways. Yet that’s the joy of the world of Cyberpunk 2077 - you can see so much of the real world within its fantasy setting, only with more swearing. A lot more swearing.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, Night City, and Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole, is very much an adult experience. Part of that is the sexual imagery plastered everywhere, the violence, the truly vile language, but more than that, it’s the characters, the dialogue, and the raging rapids of emotions you’re forced to contend with.</p>
<p>You see, V isn’t alone. Lodged in their synapses they also have the personality of a long-dead terrorist and rockerboy Johnny Silverhand, breathtakingly realised by Keanu Reeves. Silverhand is slowly taking over V’s mind and body, but even he’s not entirely happy about it. The journey these two are forced to share is one of betrayal, death, impossible choices, and a hell of a lot more besides. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Cyberpunk 2077’s story might be one of the best you’re likely to come across.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156543/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s more impressive is how it presents itself. Just like CD Projekt Red’s previous efforts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, the line between primary story mission and side mission is furiously blurred. You might accept a mission that sounds basic and almost one-dimensional at first, only to be thrust into an entirely different thread of Night City’s ever-changing story. A simple spark of jealousy from a client fearing their relationship isn’t as stable as they’d thought can spiral out of control into a multi-mission omnibus that asks you to define how far someone needs to go before they might no longer be considered human. A lighthearted romp for all the family.</p>
<p>I found myself second-guessing what missions were deemed ‘main story’ for a while, because the side missions get just as much care and attention poured into them. Chances are you won’t even see all of them on your first time through either, as seemingly minor decisions you make at various points can have a noticeable impact on what characters and missions are available to you as you progress.</p>
<p>You’ll most likely not even realise, though. Hell, I’ve probably missed some massive missions I would have loved because of some seemingly innocuous dialogue option. It gives the game this great sense of replayability, heightened further by its other mechanics.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156579/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll be doing a fair bit of fighting in Night City and its outskirts, and you need to decide how you plan to go about staying alive. You can focus on melee weapons, gunplay, or ‘netrunning’, which is arguably the game’s magic system. But as the old saying goes, the proof of the meat is in the detail, and Cyberpunk 2077 provides an awful lot of variance within these three categories.</p>
<p>Melee weapons range from hammers, to hinged blades that burst from your forearms, to a glowing wire that, again, comes out of your arms somehow. Guns can be powerful enough to shoot through certain walls, charged for extra wallop, or clever enough to fire their bullets around corners and directly into your victim’s skull. Netrunning enables hacking into nearby systems on the fly, letting you explode (presumably smart) fuel canisters, or even send a computer virus into your enemies causing a visceral illness that spreads between any other nasty person that might be standing too close.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156533/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is only scratching the surface of the flexibility available to you, and this goes even further with cyberware. As you might expect, cyberware is a load of cybernetics you wear. Well, not so much <em>wear</em> as have implanted into your nervous system, legs, brain, the whole megillah. You can have these implanted at various locations by certified ripperdocs, meaning you can’t change them yourself when you’re wandering around a nightclub or mooching around your flat. Probably for the best.</p>
<p>Every piece of cyberware comes with bonuses, some simple, like a faster rate of healing, and some that give you entirely new abilities, such as being able to jump ten metres into the air. You also have a skill tree to manage, which is thankfully fairly straightforward in isolation, and allows you to rework your unlocks whenever you like.</p>
<p>The customisation on offer in Cyberpunk 2077 is astonishingly broad, rewarding, and beautifully realised, but we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t perhaps <em>a little</em> overwhelming, even after tens of hours of play. It’s unavoidable, really; offer a magnitude of possibilities and you’re inevitably going to leave players somewhat paralysed by choice. My advice? Just dive in, don’t think too much about it. You can always make some more eddies if you want to change things later. Or just go with your choices and save the other stuff for a subsequent playthrough.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156540/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the processes for these elements are comparatively straightforward. Crafting, for example, is all managed using generic ‘components’ of various ranks, which you can find in containers all over the place. It makes the swathes of options available to you much more attainable, and makes experimentation something that’s fun to fiddle around with, rather than an exercise in frustration.</p>
<p>The game also places a degree of focus on stealth, a sentence that might fill you with dread, but luckily Cyberpunk manages to execute its stealth in a satisfying way. Yes, enemies are a bit unobservant, but they have to be to make sneaking around even remotely fun, and the various netrunning skills you have at your disposal to map out the area, distract foes, and even make a swift recovery when spotted — should you act quickly enough of course — makes stealth almost a highlight of the combat in many ways.</p>
<p>It’s deeply rewarding to infiltrate a building, take out guards, send them running in the wrong direction, or lure them towards an explosive container and… well, you can imagine. It makes you feel genuinely powerful and sneaky, but get too big for your boots and you <em>will</em> be spotted. It’s a great balance, and you can almost always ignore it and run in with a katana regardless, should you prefer, just be prepared to deal with an awful lot of angry firepower.</p>

<p>Stealth takes an even more important role in the included DLC Phantom Liberty, a substantial extra slice of Night City goodness that is ingrained so effortlessly into the base game (and included in this Switch 2 release), you’d be forgiven for not noticing where one ends and another begins.</p>
<p>As opposed to your criminal dealings in the rest of Night City, Phantom Liberty and the new area of Dogtown have you running around as an agent of the government. Don’t worry, you’ll still be knee-deep in morally questionable actions throughout, but it’s a nice change of pace and setting compared to the base game.</p>
<p>You’ll team up with agents of the New United States of America, and some of them aren’t even completely jaded by being chewed up by their country and spat back out. Good for them. The people you work with are some of the best characters the game has to offer, not least Reed, played by the ever-wonderful Idris Elba, and trust me when I say that the bar set by the base game is <em>high</em>. Their dialogue, motivations - it’s all so relatable in such an alien and unfamiliar setting, and it had its hooks in me almost immediately.</p>

<p>Speaking of setting, one thing I didn’t fully expect my first time playing was that Dogtown could be worse than the other districts of Night City. This was a presumption promptly propelled out the window as the filth-soaked streets opened up to me. The whole area is run by Kurt Hansen, a man who claims he protects Dogtown and its residents whilst ruling with an iron fist, and his BARGHEST goons execute residents for sneezing without a permit. It’s a perfectly grim location for such a grim ‘society’, and I love it.</p>
<p>So, it’s a seriously meaty game; how does Nintendo’s new system handle such a demanding title? In short, it does an <em>excellent</em> job. There are two graphical modes: Quality, which targets 30fps and higher fidelity; and Performance, which ekes things out to an unusual (for a console) 40fps.</p>
<p>They’re both available in handheld no matter what, but Performance only works in docked mode if you have a 120hz TV or monitor, as 40 is not a factor of 60. Trust us, we worked it out on a calculator and everything, 40fps on a 60hz screen would cause some <em>wild</em> frame time inconsistencies, and would look awful.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 10 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156542/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both modes are a delight, and for the most part I stuck with Quality as I was playing docked and don’t have a whizzo 120hz TV. I originally played with motion blur enabled, but after getting used to it switched off, I can’t ever go back. It takes the edge off the low frame rate at first, but the game is <em>substantially</em> crisper and better looking without it.</p>
<p>Where things really shined, though, was handheld mode; when docked I could forget I was playing on a portable device, but holding the game in my hands looking as good as it does, and at 40fps on the Switch 2’s excellent VRR display, was something utterly magical, and bizarre. Couple this with cross-progression and you have the <em>ultimate</em> way to play Cyberpunk on the go, even if you're not new to the game.</p>
<p>There are moments when the game stutters, mainly loading new areas when driving about, and a few little hitches in various areas of Dogtown, but overall? The performance genuinely delighted me. I did notice a few graphical anomalies where the geometry seemed to go bananas (again, mostly in Dogtown), but they never really impacted my time more than, ‘Oh, that’s odd, can I make it happen again?’ Truly, this is the poster child for what ports can look like on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is a remarkable launch-day port for Nintendo's new console. Its deep, diverse, and tangible world is fully realised with impressive performance for such a low-powered device. If you've not taken your first steps into Night City already, or you're a long-time player with a portable-play itch that needs scratching, you're in for a serious treat, choom.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156516/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> (an incredibly good fighter, eventually,) launched in a famously sorry state back in 2016, with no single-player content of note, janky multiplayer, and a roster of fighters that took an age (and lots more money up front) to grow into something that felt fully complete. It was still very good in the end, don't get us wrong, but what a terrible start it had.</p>
<p>Almost as though it might have learned a lesson from the ensuing roasting from fans, the Japanese giant made sure that it dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> in a much more complete form in 2023. Indeed, it sort of went the other direction entirely. In a good way.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/street-fighter-6">which we all know by now is brilliant</a>, arrived with a huge — and surprisingly addicting — single-player adventure mode (kind of like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_23">FIFA</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nba_2k25">NBA 2K's</a> story mode, but you here you 'fight' people in the 'street'...so also like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza</a>, then), a full suite of funky new multiplayer diversions, and an arcade mode that's a step up from what preceded it. These three central modes are divided into World Tour (that's your single-player RPG-lite adventure), then Battle Hub for those online shenanigans, and finally Fighting Grounds, which is your arcade, versus, and more traditional stuff. Nice.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156519/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's immediately obvious, as soon as you boot up, in fact, that there's a ton of content here, and most folk will, I'll wager, head straight into the World Tour mode as a first port of call. Which is a good idea! Much more than a throwaway offering to appease the angry solo player hordes, World Tour is a joyous celebration of everything Street Fighter, from the present day right back to its beginnings.</p>
<p>There's an impressive city to strut around, a whole bunch of legendary fighters to find and assign as your trainer (unlocking their skillsets to equip to your fully customisable character), and loads of very silly missions to undertake. It's a mode that doesn't take itself in any way seriously (you'll fight thugs with cardboard boxes on their heads and meet a superhero in the first 10 minutes), but also remembers to be exciting, fun and — most importantly — <em>educational</em> at the same time.</p>
<p>Indeed, in terms of excitement, I'm not sure I've ever had a better feeling (whilst playing solo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a>, you understand) than rising up through the ranks, roughing it with the duds (there's a wee guy called Kenny, who thinks he's Ken Masters, who I recommend punching at every opportunity) and eventually getting to take on bigger and better opponents in matches framed as big events. It's all very pleasing. Long-term fans will also be very impressed, I should think, by how many nods to the history of this great series there are here.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156522/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Newcomers take note! Diving headlong into World Tour, embracing all of its wackiness and endless customisation, will pay big dividends down the line. You really do get a great intro to everything you need to know about the game's systems and characters through playing here, and alongside a deep training mode that gives you every option under the sun to analyse and refine, this is an entry that's got everything you need to become a street-fighting legend.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's even 'modern' controls that streamline everything to four buttons, too, so now is a great time to get into this franchise if you've ever been tempted but a bit resistant to all the learning of moves.</p>
<p>With regards to the Battle Hub, the boring menus and lobbies of old have been replaced with a big shiny virtual arcade where you can go hang out, chat to other fighters, challenge avatars to an 'avatar battle' or take a seat at an arcade cabinet to kick off a ranked or casual battle. Heck, this virtual arena even has a rotating selection of classic Capcom arcade games to play, too. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/final_fight">Final Fight</a>, anyone? Quick round of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/vulgus">Vulgus</a>? Suit yourself, mate.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156514/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiplayer modes, which are split across the Battle Hub and the traditional Fighting Ground modes, cover everything you'd expect with regards to head-to-head ranked and practice battles. You also get lots of special event matches, extreme battles with lots of customisable aspects, the aforementioned avatar battles, and there's even an AI suite that emulates ranked fighters of various levels. I'll be honest, I don't do much in the way of online Street Fighter (too stressful, and I'm crap), but I've found myself playing quite a lot of this multiplayer over the past year or two since the game first released. It's just a fun time, and you can match up with folk of similar (terrible) ability.</p>
<p>So they've more that fixed the content part of the equation, as I've said. But how's the auld scrapping? Well, it's possibly the best it's ever been since the halcyon days of [INSERT FAVOURITE STREET FIGHTER GAME]. It really is that good.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 retools the series' killer core loops by introducing 'Drive Impacts' and a 'Drive Gauge'. This easy-to-learn system (being welcoming to newcomers certainly is a recurring theme here) builds and recovers as you fight and gives you access to a suite of powered-up versions of your chosen character's specials. It also allows you to perform reversals, blocks and parries that feel coherent and satisfying to pick up and run with. There's no sweating it picking up new mechanics and combining them, everything here feels tied together in just the right way, allowing even newbies to get into the underlying aspects that add depth to all the jumping up and down and fireballs.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156515/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Super Arts return too, and combined with a roster of fighters which was stacked at launch — and in its 'Years 1-2 Fighters Edition' is even moreso — you've got a great big street-fighting party to be getting on with.</p>
<p>Of course, most of these things are known quantities by now. The fact that Street Fighter 6 has been in the wild since the summer of '23 brings with it lots of benefits for Switch 2 players, what with all the tweaking and updates that have come.</p>
<p>And so let's move to the most vital part of this review: <em>How does it all fare on Switch 2?</em> It fares very, very well, thanks for asking. However, there is one fly in the ointment (and it's a fly that's been marinating in there since previous gen versions) in that fights in World Tour Mode drop to 30fps in action. I don't mind this, personally — I am very old and anything over 20fps feels like you are spoiling someone who played through all of Oblivion at 4fps — but it's a fairly big deal, let's face it.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156521/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing in World Tour is impressive on the whole, the city has seen cuts to how reflective and shiny it all is, and there's more of that weird dithering effect on surfaces and edges here than in the flashy versions elsewhere, but it feels good and it looks great overall, even on a big TV, and doubly so in portable. I'm even gonna go out on a limb and say it looks slightly better than I remember it looking (and performing) on Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>But there's still no getting around the fact that some people (maybe a lot of people) will nope out of 30fps fights all day. It's a shame, but it is at least tempered by the fact that 60fps is here in all other modes and the game feels incredible — especially with a Pro Controller — and looks the business when playing online, in arcade, and everywhere else.</p>
<p>I want to double back to the controller, too, as I reckon this is the first time I've used the Joy-Con initially and, almost immediately, switched out to a different pad. The Joy-Con really aren't the best choice here, so if you're taking things seriously, a new pad is gonna be something to think on.</p>
<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156518/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Online has felt great, fully in line with other versions (and with cross-play - that's important!), and besides the odd loading time that seems a tad longer, everything is as it should be. It really is quite the thing, to sit with a new AAA fighter like Street Fighter 6 in portable mode, with any slight graphical drawback a much easier pill to swallow thanks to the fact that performance is so clean and crisp across the entire package.</p>
<p>So, a fantastic fighter arrives day one on Nintendo Switch 2 and, besides that one 30fps stumble with frame rate in World Tour's scraps, we are good to go. Playing Street Fighter 6 in handheld on this bad boy — and especially with a proper pad — could well end up being my preferred way to rise up the ranks going forward.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2 is a cracker, and in portable mode, it could well become my preferred way to play this fantastic entry in Capcom's storied franchise. The only fly in the ointment with this port is 30fps fights in World Tour. It's a shame, and it's 100% gonna be a dealbreaker for some.</p>
<p>But if you can overlook that, the rest of what's here is crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped. All other modes are fully featured and running at 60fps, and online works a treat.</p></section>

<p>It's exciting news but it's also left many fans wondering about the physical distribution of this enhanced classic.

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> Having only gotten our hands on the game and the new system <strong>extremely</strong> recently, this is — as you can see from the title — a review in progress. We just haven't had enough time with it yet, but we wanted to share our initial impressions (seeing as we're all playing it at once).</em></p>
<p><em>We'll be updating the text over the coming days and will deliver a final verdict as soon as possible. Until then, enjoy our early takes, and head down to the comments to let us know how you're liking (or maybe disliking!) the headline Switch 2 launch game.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>True story: not long before Switch 2 launched, I passed my driving test in America. A new <strong>Mario Kart</strong> game perhaps isn't the <em>best</em> game to start after getting a licence in a different country, nor do I recommend taking lessons from a game that puts a cow in the driver's seat, but that's besides the point.</p>
<p>However, driving around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s huge courses and expansive open world is <em>exactly</em> like driving in a new country. I know that sounds crazy, but bear with me. The roads are slightly different, much wider, with more lanes and more cars. You can turn right on red, you can commandeer lorries by driving into the back of them, and even pick up food while moving... (I'll let you decide which are real-world and Mario Kart rules.)</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that this isn't quite a reinvention of Mario Kart or a completely new, innovative racing game. But the freedom, variety, and new modes mean that I haven't smiled this much playing a game competitively with others than... well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>So yes, playing World is like putting on a brand new pair of your favourite racing gloves. It controls basically the same, and Grand Prix and Battle Mode play out identically to previous iterations.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Mario Kart World (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156499/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The big addition here is the increase to 24 racers, which ups the stakes tenfold. I was worried about how big and empty the roads might feel, but the larger number of competitors completely justifies it when I'm being juggled between a Bob-omb, a bus, and a Coin Shell in quick succession while coins and items are being scattered about everywhere. Races can be utter chaos in the best possible way, particularly online.</p>

<p>The larger roster and wider courses mean that I have a whole new slate of tracks to explore, some familiar, some very new. Cheep Cheep Falls' beautiful Asian-inspired scenery, Peach Stadium's blush-tinted cherry blossom grounds, and the thrill of chasing the robotic monkey in DK Spaceport are just a handful of highlights I've experienced with the new courses, but the old have something to offer too.</p>
<h2>On Course</h2>
<p>Because of the way the game's is structured, every single course is basically part of a wider 'World' and is connected to the next in either the Grand Prix or new Knockout Tour mode. I raced through Choco Mountain in New York back at the Switch 2 Experience and I didn't even recognise it; new twists and turns, metallic structures, cables and wires everywhere. Where is my ugly, chocolatey mountain from 1996?</p>
<p>The tracks work best when they blend twists and turns with finicky grind rails, often in the form of vines, cable lines, and railings. But there are times this formula doesn't quite work for me, though.</p>
<p>For one, a few courses are here as you essentially remember them. Unlike the drastically different Choco Mountain, Moo Moo Meadows, another frequent returner, is essentially the same course we've driven through hundreds of times. And Battle Mode <em>does</em> suffer from having roads and maps that are too big — who knew it'd be hard to find 23 other racers.</p>

<p>I also worry about my long-term enjoyment from some of the courses, given how there are many straighter sections. In Grand Prix, it's weird to essentially just drive through two straight laps and then do a final lap or two of the <em>actual</em> course at the end. So the glow of finding these new delights might wear off.</p>

<h2>It's a Knockout (Tour)</h2>
<p>I don't think that's the case with Knockout Tour, however. While 'World' is in the game title, Knockout Tour is <em>the</em> knock-out feature of Mario Kart World. It's a seamless race from one edge of the map to another, and this is where those more linear course designs actually work.</p>
<p>In what is essentially a survival mode, you drive through six course 'checkpoints' over a long stretch, and at every checkpoint the bottom four racers are eliminated, Knockout Tour is the most I've ever panicked at Mario Kart in a long time. With the right players, you can go from 1st to 20th in a matter of seconds because you're vying for more than just first place — you're racing to survive.</p>

<p>In one instance, in Ice Rally, I spent the whole second section of the race in first place, only to be sneaked up on and hit with two green shells one after the other at the start of Cheep Cheep Falls and fall down five places. Stuffing mushrooms like no one's business, I proceeded to cut completely through a winding downhill path, ignoring the roads entirely, and I managed to narrow the gap.</p>
<p>It's a real thrill, and I can't wait to keep improving and learning the ropes to become the Knockout champion.</p>
<h2>I'm a Free Roamer</h2>
<p>But the actual, real headlining feature of Mario Kart World is its world, a huge open map that you can explore in Free Roam mode.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised to find out Monolith Soft, the studio that gave us the <strong>Xenoblade</strong> series, worked its magic on this game. But you also shouldn't go in expecting an Aionios or Mira-sized map stuffed with landmarks and surprises. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> this ain't, and while I don't think it needs to be that, there's something... missing in the open roads.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Mario Kart World (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156503/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, what it <em>is</em> is a lush landscape that allows you to just drive around and soak in all the details and challenges that Mario Kart World has to offer. There are some killer sunsets in this big landscape, let me tell you, and perfect photo opportunities. As a self-proclaimed sucker for photo mode, this could be dangerous for me.</p>
<p>There are secrets in the form of P Switches, collectible medallions, and panels to hit, but the rewards for these are pretty lacklustre. I admit, stickers are cute, but it's not exactly the kind of thing I wanted to see picking up hard-to-find items.</p>
<p>P Switches, however, add a little flavour to the world with a variety of challenges from collecting Blue Coins, while others take you on a leisurely drive with NPCs where you need to hit time gates to stop the clock from running out. The ones that want me to wall drive, right now, are my nemesis. But every new one I roll up and discover, I'm curiously driving over the button only to be surprised every single time. I hope I feel like that even more as I dig into every corner of the map.</p>

<p>I wanted to explore the world map with my partner and take silly photographs together, only to find that you can't experience Free Roam mode in split screen co-op, an extremely weird and disappointing omission given how good splitscreen is elsewhere. I'll have to hunt down some friends online for a little road trip.</p>
<p><em>(Update: it turns out you can technically do split-screen co-op, but it's not very obvious, and it has restrictions — no P Switches, booo! — so there you go.)</em></p>
<h2>Audio-Visual Delights</h2>
<p>Still, I'm glad Free Roam exists even if it's mostly to fall in love with the sights and sounds of Mario Kart World. Mario Kart has always been a colourful series, but World takes this to kaleidoscopic new heights, with every single course both blending seamlessly with the next while also having its own distinct audio and visual identity.</p>
<p>The draw distance and lighting in particular are a huge step up, and I love flying around the courses and seeing a different track that's three or four roads away from a huge distance away. It also runs perfectly docked and undocked for me so far, with only a little pop in here and there as I progressed through courses.</p>
<p>But here's where my other favourite aspect comes in — the animation. I am living for this new, expressive era of Mario kickstarted by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. I never get tired of seeing me, as King Boo, line up on the grid laughing at my opponents. Or my first-place Daisy eyeing up the second-place Donkey Kong as we battle it out for victory.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Mario Kart World (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156507/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even small things like the variety of costumes — of which I wish Pauline and DK had a few more, particularly given their first big appearance and new design — give so much personality and expressiveness to each character. I'm always excited</p>

<p>And gosh, yes Jim, the music — <em>the music</em>. Even just driving around in Free Roam, I've heard renditions of Tick-Tock Clock, Good Egg Galaxy, Dire Dire Docks, Athletic...</p>
<h2>Online + GameChat</h2>
<p>If Free Roam is for chilling out and listening to the music, then Online is the complete opposite of that. Outside of exploring the open map, I think this is where I'll spend most of my Mario Kart World time — I've yet to play it with my partner, so that's on the agenda. But I'll also be dipping my toes in online too, because if you want the definition of chaos, well, it's Knockout Tour Online. And I can't get enough.</p>

<p>Match-ups are smooth and I've had absolutely zero problems playing with others online — no connection issues, no lag, no nothing, both docked and handheld. I know Mario Kart has always been pretty good at online, but I'm actually shocked to see how stable servers are this close to launch.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Mario Kart World (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The thrill of online is just playing with a bunch of like minded people and getting pummelled — and pummelling others — with items and traps and tricks, trying to outdo each other as you crash and bash around these huge courses. If you are worried about the tracks feeling big, then any Knockout Tour race online will completely ease those doubts.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Right now, Mario Kart World doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart people wanted or expected, but there are few games that bring me as much laughter and joy as this. World refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p>
<p>There's still many an open-world surface to scratch, and I need to test my patience with some of those straighter or more familiar courses in Grand Prix, but if you need a pick-me-up, Mario Kart World is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like the perfect start to the Switch 2's life.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Launch Nintendo Store NYC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4780ac3185cac/switch-2-launch-nintendo-store-nyc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the sounds of construction coming from every which way and the early June summer heat and warm afternoon sun rays shining down, it could have been a normal New York City day.</p>
<p>But for today, anybody asking people on the line going along 48th Street had a new answer for the classic question of, “What are you all lining up for?” All they had to do was make a turn at Rockefeller Plaza and see what Nintendo New York had set up.</p>
<p>In anticipation of Nintendo Switch 2’s midnight launch, the Nintendo New York store set up a 'Pre-Launch Event' both inside the store and out on Rockefeller Plaza. Whether you were a diehard Nintendo fan who managed to lock in a preorder for the new system or just a curious passerby, you could drop by and line up for a bit to play the latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> game or test-drive the other titles in their launch lineup.</p>

<p>I arrived shortly after noon and landed a decent spot ahead of the 3pm start time. It wasn’t hard to spot the truly dyed-in-the-wool Nintendo fans in the line, wearing Mario or Luigi hats or even doing full cosplay as other Nintendo game characters like Ness from the beloved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a>.</p>
<p>Passing the time came easy for this crowd who all had their Switches at the ready, and it even got as hardcore as certain fans breaking out their Nintendo 3DS to try and StreetPass with anybody else they could find. It was genuinely great to see there were fans keeping that particular social gaming tradition alive.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Launch Nintendo Store NYC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2502ff6064f5b/switch-2-launch-nintendo-store-nyc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the clock struck three, people in the line were guided around the corner to the big gaming area where two giant sessions of Mario Kart World would routinely chew through 12 players at a time each doing their best to survive the new Knockout Tour mode. Those who got knocked out of the early rounds were still allowed to stick around and join in the crowd cheering on the players still in the game, and event staff were great at keeping the players and onlookers energised.</p>
<p>Every player got a free mini-poster for their time. With the two-hit combo of both not being familiar with this latest entry and it being a long while since I’d played a Mario Kart game, I’m pleased to report that while I didn’t land first place, I did go the distance and make it to the final lap with the Cow.</p>
<p>Nintendo New York also customised their second-floor game test area to offer a decent chunk of the Switch 2 launch lineup. Mario Kart World being the big new title, it commanded top presence on the kiosk which used the big screen of the game test area for those queued up to experience its traditional mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Launch Nintendo Store NYC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3661fae1f6342/switch-2-launch-nintendo-store-nyc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other games on offer were there to show off the system’s new features as well as how games from Switch had enhanced performance on the new hardware. Having had my fill of Mario Kart World already, I took the time to test out the Joy-Con 2 and their mouse mode with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, and appreciated what time I had running around Hyrule in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> at a higher frame rate before getting lasered to death by a Guardian. My beam-reflecting shield parry skills had gotten rusty.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the midnight launch, Nintendo New York required that visitors had the Warp Pipe access to attend, so yours-truly was locked out of the occasion, but I made sure to get face time with the one and only ChickenDog, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/random-of-course-nintendo-fans-are-already-camping-out-for-the-switch-2">the guy who was first in line for the Switch 2</a> at Nintendo New York:</p>
<p><strong>NL: What’s your name and where are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I’m ChickenDog, I’m the guy that’s waiting for the Nintendo Switch 2, and I’m from Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>And how long have you been waiting for the Switch 2 here at the Nintendo store?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been waiting around April 4th or 5th, I don’t remember the exact day because it was so long ago, but I started around that time, a day or two after the Switch 2 Direct, all the games.</p>
<p><strong>How did the logistics go about for you all waiting for the Switch 2 for these two months?</strong></p>
<p>Normally for games and consoles, people line up across the street early when they’re camping out [for long periods of time], because that’s a public street. We can’t line up here [that early at Nintendo New York] because it’s Rockefeller. So we talked to the managers, to staff, and we coordinated a list so we just took a small group across the street until now to finally form the line over here. So no one cuts, everyone’s still in line, and everyone has a cool time.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Launch Nintendo Store NYC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/925074dbfec06/switch-2-launch-nintendo-store-nyc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So what are you most looking forward to for Switch 2?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, obviously Mario Kart World.</p>
<p><strong>What went through your mind for you to be like, 'I gotta be here at Nintendo New York for the Switch 2, and I gotta be here Number One'?</strong></p>
<p>There was a guy that originally did this in the last generation, named Alex, he did [the Nintendo Switch midnight launch] in a month, and I saw the Switch 2 trailer - I thought it was gonna be a whole different console name. So I thought in my mind, you know…. Switch 2. Two months. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Aside from Mario Kart World, what else are you going to nab here, or are you going to go all-digital?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not gonna go digital, I’m more of a physical guy, that’s why I’m camping out. I’m a collector, I like collecting games, I like saving my games over time, so when I’m older, I can just go back and look at all the games I collected as a kid. I’m gonna see if they have a GameCube controller, I might get that, and I might also get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, the collector’s edition. I tried to get into Yakuza, now that the Switch 2’s coming out, I can play on the go? Definitely wanna get into that franchise.</p>
<p><strong>What new stuff are you hype for with this new hardware?</strong></p>
<p>I think the one thing I’m really excited about is the new mouse features, I can’t wait to try it out when I’m playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a> or some other games. Maybe even for a future <strong>Splatoon</strong> title, maybe they’ll have the mouse controls.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but think about the time between the original Switch’s big launch day event and now, with how much the world changed and those shifting circumstances necessitating that Nintendo’s game hardware contemporaries held off from the ceremony of the new system launch for their own consoles.</p>
<p>As silly as it sounds, and as much as the 'Nature is healing' joke gets play over fairly insignificant things, the Switch 2 event did feel like coming home for this guy who misses these big launch events.</p>

<p>Ready..? GO!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> is perhaps one of the best deals on Nintendo Switch 2 right now.</p>
<p>Priced at just <strong>£13.49 / €14.99</strong> / <strong>$14.99</strong>, it rocks some serious chops with 4K/60fps support during docked mode, and a brand new fusion mechanic that will let you create dozens of unique vehicles.</p>
<p>Is it actually good though? Well, our review is still in the works (spoiler alert – it's pretty darn good so far), but in the meantime, we've put together a 14-minute gameplay video for your perusal.</p>
<p>You'll see that the game still features the same 'phasing' mechanic seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>, lots of boosting, along with a new ability to essentially jump whenever you see fit, letting you grab hidden items and reach new areas of the tracks.</p>
<p>Fast Fusion joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, and more as launch titles for Nintendo's new system.</p>

<p>Storage for 36 games</p>

<figure><a title="Genki's Mimic Chest Stores All Of Your Switch 2 Games In Plain Sight 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11d70d082ad92/genkis-mimic-chest-stores-all-of-your-switch-2-games-in-plain-sight-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">Genki might be in the headlines for incurring the legal wrath of Nintendo</a>, but the company is still supporting the Switch 2's launch with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/genki-unleashes-some-slick-new-switch-2-accessories">a range of new accessories</a>, one of which offers a unique storage solution for your Switch and Switch 2 game cartridges.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/mimic-chest-pre-order?srsltid=AfmBOoo4p59IqDq-deTrx7T06ZY2RHcRyTKHc5kuZBFT8ifI8xBry-B9">"Mimic Chest"</a> is actually three different Switch 2-style red plastic cases, which are the exact same size as standard Switch cases. The difference here is that when you open one up, you'll find space for 12 game carts. Three cases mean storage potential for a whopping 36 games.</p>
<p>Given that I've personally had to purchase several game cart storage cases during my time with the original Switch, having this kind of option is welcome—but there are some caveats.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's no cover inlay (Genki says it will offer the option to print your own, but it doesn't seem to live on the company's site at the moment), which makes the cases look a bit odd when they're placed on your shelf next to your games.</p>

<p>This functionality leads to its own oddness; why would you put all of your carts into a single case if you're planning on popping it on the shelf alongside your other games? Why not just keep the games in their individual cases, which makes them easier to find in a hurry? It feels a little like a solution in search of a problem. The cases are also larger (and less sturdy, given the thin nature of the inlay cover) than ones offered by other companies, such as Hori, so they're not <em>quite</em> as portable.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the game carts don't fit as snugly in each slot as I'd like, so they rattle around when the case is moved. It's something you quickly learn to ignore, but is still a little annoying.</p>
<p>I imagine some people will like the idea of having all of their carts in one place, but to me, the Mimic Chest isn't as essential as, say, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HORI-Switch-Game-Card-Case/dp/B01NASY99Z?tag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Hori game card case</a>, which feels more compact and portable yet has room for 24 games. The Mimic Chest doesn't feel like a product I'd carry around with me, and to get the full benefit of 36-game storage, you're taking not one, not two, but <em>three</em> cases on the road with you.</p>



<p><em>The Genki Mimic Chest costs <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/mimic-chest-pre-order?srsltid=AfmBOoo4p59IqDq-deTrx7T06ZY2RHcRyTKHc5kuZBFT8ifI8xBry-B9">$19.99 / £17</a> and is available directly from the manufacturer.</em></p>
