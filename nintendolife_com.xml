<figure data-uuid="ad9fc94b58542"><a title="Absolum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad9fc94b58542/absolum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Dotemu, Crush Guard Games, and Supamonks have today announced that big things are coming to their fantasy 'rouge 'em up', <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, next year, starting with the game's first major update.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.1 update, 'The Threads of Fate', will launch at some point in "<strong>Early 2026</strong>" (the studios haven't been more precise than that at the moment), and will bring a healthy dose of new content alongside the usual tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>First up is a batch of new 'Mystic Ordeal' challenges, which will let you add challenging quirks to your runs to put your skills to the test — you'll even be able to set your own rules and share them with others via a code. Select stages of your journey across Talamh will also become corrupted, with stronger enemies therein granting bigger rewards. Don't worry if you're finding the base game challenging enough; both of these will be completely optional.</p><div><figure data-videoid="NHONnA_kS_M" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytNHONnA_kS_M" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHONnA_kS_M?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64cc89qrtznp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The devs are also introducing newly evolved mounts that pack more of a punch, and a batch of fresh in-game skins and emotes, so you can get your party looking as sharp as they deserve.</p>

<p>The devs shared a full rundown of the upcoming changes in a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673">Steam</a>, concluding by thanking everyone who has played so far: "We wanted to take a moment, once again, to thank you for joining our rebellion, and lending your skills, passion and personality to our resistance movement."</p>
<p>We had a great time with Absolum on Switch earlier this year, calling it "one of the best of its kind, whatever that kind may be" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">9/10 review</a>. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long in 2026 to see its updates come our way.</p>
