<p>The Virtuos team chimes in</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b637da5b98c/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even now that we've got our hands on the Switch 2, there are still developers sharing their thoughts about the power of the system and where it fits in. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">same interview with Wccftech</a>, the Virtuos team was asked how the new Nintendo device holds up in terms of "raw console performance" and if it's closer to an Xbox Series S or PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>According to Eoin O'Grady, who is technical director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos studio and subsidiary), it's a bit of both, depending on what aspect of the hardware you're looking at. The GPU in the Switch 2 apparently performs "slightly below" the Series S (but does come with some added technologies) and as for the CPU, the Switch 2 is supposedly "closer" to the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Here's O'Grady's response in full, which also goes into how the experience might be for developers porting their current games to Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>"GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>
<p>"CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows companies like Koei Tecmo suggesting Nintendo's new hybrid system was closer to an Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power". Other companies like Firaxis (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/civilization-vii-dev-likens-games-switch-2-graphical-performance-to-mid-tier-pc">have also chimed in</a> with their own development experiences. Nvidia (the creator of the Switch 2 chip) even labelled it a "technical marvel" and "unlike anything" it's ever built before.</p>

<p>"The handheld market is growing right now"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aec7c2409cab/star-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One company that backed the Switch throughout its life was the port specialist Virtuos – working on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> for the hybrid platform. It might just be the beginning of the Switch 2's life, but the same team is already sounding confident about the new hardware's future.</p>
<p>Speaking to Wccftech recently, Eoin O'Grady – the technical director of Virtuos' subsidiary Black Shamrock (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starlink_battle_for_atlas">Starlink: Battle for Atlas</a>) – believes the Switch 2 will "surpass" the success of the original system.</p>
<p>He believes the "growth" in the handheld gaming market right now (thanks to devices like the original Switch and Steam Deck) will help the Switch 2's success, and it can feed off this "growing demand for gaming on the go" with a combination of "indie gems", "Nintendo exclusives" and "now AAA blockbuster titles".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now...so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos' North America director of business development Alex Heise adds to this – highlighting how the "strong brand" and "proven success" of the original Switch system with a "2" attached to the name should make the value of the new device "immediately clear" compared to certain <em>other</em> Nintendo systems of the past.</p>
<p>He says how although nobody probably "fully predicted" the Switch 2 would become the "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">fastest-selling console launch of all-time</a>", Virtuos still had high expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console ever had a '2' in its name".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo confirmed its new hybrid hardware had sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days of the system's life – also making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em>. As of March 31, 2025, the original Switch has now sold more than 152 million units worldwide over eight years.</p>
<p>Other third-party developers showing their support for the Switch 2 include companies like CD Projekt Red (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>) and Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>).</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36bf257cba01c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Yes, believe it or not, it's been a full month since the launch of the Switch 2 - it's certainly been a busy few weeks. Now that the dust has settled, let's take a look back at how the long-awaited console came out of the gate, from the perspective of Nintendo, players, and media...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Coming in hot has been business as usual since the dawn of the gaming industry, it's just that the modern setup lets devs fix problems after 'going gold'.</p>
<p>Depressing as it is as a player, 'ship first, patch later' is the norm and these days that goes for hardware, too. Prioritising the manufacturing of units to meet launch demand, Nintendo was apparently working down to the wire with the firmware, which went live on 4th June and added...well, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68526">everything</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this approach ensures that nothing's going to leak, right? Unfortunately, it means enthusiast media gets left out in the cold at a time when outlets are dropping like flies and sites of all sizes are left scrambling to get coverage live for readers in the post-launch hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<p>'Suboptimal' is a polite word I find myself using a lot these days, and everyone on the NL team — and at gaming outlets everywhere — has done an incredible job over the past month. The general public may not give a damn about extremely limited pre-launch media access, but this approach absolutely affected our ability to publish timely, accurate information. Questions that could have been asked and answered weeks or <em>months</em> before got stirred into the launch frenzy, leading to confusion on all sides that could have been avoided.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:183286 @ 1751777791 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd3a91f03dd4/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, it's Nintendo's prerogative to prioritise public-facing Switch 2 Experiences over media access — specialist or otherwise — and to be fair, the, er, 'suboptimal' economic situation in the US and the associated pricing and distribution challenges thrown up at the 11th hour meant that, from a business POV, the company had bigger worries than sending out review hardware.</p>
<p>Printed Mario Kart World game codes apparently inserted into standard solo system boxes (to convert them into bundles, versus 'native' bundles where the code is tied to the system itself and auto-redeemed to your Nintendo Account once you access the eShop) suggests a quick pivot to account for the enormous interest in the MK bundle SKU.</p>
<p>Arguably, the company rolled with the unpredictable tariff punches fairly well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-the-switch-2-pre-order-situation-sucks-but-can-nintendo-do-anything-about-it">juggling retailer and customer expectations</a> with pre-order delays in North America while keeping its messaging as clear as possible. Anecdotally, almost nobody I know who wanted a Switch 2 at launch failed to get one, and although we could all do without the stress of F5-ing webpages — and some regions fared better than others (with plenty of Japanese fans not having lottery luck <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand">as demand exceeded supply</a>) — on the whole, Nintendo did a decent job getting consoles into players' hands on 5th June.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184232 @ 1751778274 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9c222bfb50b6/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tariff situation exacerbated general discontent over pricing, though. While on the higher end of estimates, the $450 price tag wasn't unexpected, but compounded with the sticker shock of an $80 launch game, the indignance over charging $10 for an obvious pack-in title, and Nintendo taking time to clarify confusion around NS2 Editions and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a>, conditions were perfect for a social media storm when all the accessories got price-hiked in the US. The continued threat of prices <em>increasing</em> over time made stressed gamers anxious to get in early, too, before the thing gets even more expensive.</p>
<p>'Stressed' is the word. It was a <em>stressful</em> launch for everyone, to varying degrees. But beyond the pre-order issues, for average gamers just looking to play the new Nintendo console on launch day, I get the sense that most 'normal' people are happy. Blimey, imagine that!</p>
<p>Sales numbers certainly indicate enthusiasm, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units sold in its first four days</a>, setting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">all-time records in the US</a> and making the system the fastest-selling ever globally. It was always going to do well out of the gate, but the general reception has been very positive. I don't see Nintendo having much trouble <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">hitting its forecasted sales of 15 million</a> in the first year.</p>
<p>That's not to say that every aspect of the hardware and software has hit for everyone. Sticking with the system itself for a moment, people have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-switch-2-battery-reportedly-lasting-under-two-hours-with-mario-kart-how-is-yours-holding-up">disappointed by the battery life</a>, and the screen is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">a point of contention</a>, too, and not just because it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-has-your-switch-2s-screen-got-any-nasty-scratches-yet">easy to scratch</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry's legitimate criticism of LCD blur</a>, in particular, saw the Nintendo Defence Force leaping to the company's defence with all the nuanced discussion and debate you'd expect on social media.</p>
<p>From Team NL's perspective, beyond missing the contrast of the OLED screen, blur isn't something we've had issues with in the main. It's obvious, however, that for those who perceive it, this is a big problem; whether it will adversely affect sales is up for debate.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9ec50ef4a549/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the fan furore over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> not being a pack-in felt more a byproduct of pricing grumbles than indignation that would genuinely influence console purchase decisions. As I said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">my review</a>, of course it should have been a pack-in, but it's a long way from a deal-breaking issue. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">criticism of Mario Kart World's 'intermission' tracks</a> and mixed feelings about the open-world aspect have hardly blemished the system's launch; it's still a tremendous game and it'll no doubt be getting updates for years to come.</p>
<p>And looking at the broader software lineup, while writers and hardcore players with access to other consoles might find the offering lacklustre, there will be millions of players for whom Cyberpunk and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> are as fresh as the new Mario Kart, too. it’s easy to dismiss them as old news, but those are both <em>phenomenal</em> games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">Reports</a> have suggested that third-party sales were dismal, but the third-party share was also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">apparently better than on Switch 1</a>. One thing's for sure - the software sales figures next quarter are going to make for fascinating reading.</p>
<p>Stand back and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">look at the 25-strong lineup</a>, though — with all-timers like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> providing support — and it’s hard to imagine a better Day One selection than this. You've got quality and quantity. Another job done from Nintendo's point of view.</p>

<p>Yes, a new 3D Mario would have launched the thing in spectacular fashion. We all love a genre-definer to kick things off — a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a> or a BOTW — and Mario Kart World certainly isn't that. Yet with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team confirmed as devs on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">SMB</a>'s 40th anniversary coming up, even if the next 3D Mario <em>is</em> still a ways off, there are quality first-party games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's launch wasn't without missteps and frustrations, then, but as a cold, calculated execution of a long-term strategy which involves iterating on a winning formula, Nintendo went for the jugular while pacing itself for the turbulent generation ahead. Ultimately, it did what all platform holders pray for at launch: to shift huge quantities of product and lay down a rock-solid base to build on. Grousing around the media approach and a price point that birthed a hashtag aside, it's been a good few weeks for Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>All eyes are on the next Nintendo Direct, but it's hard to argue that the launch was anything but a big success. And with DK Bananza in the chamber, the future is looking bright.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the polls how well you think Nintendo handled the Switch 2 launch and if you're satisfied with your still-quite-new console.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I’m just gonna say it... #PerfectDark #PerfectPickUp speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the chances of the latest project getting revived in some way or form appear to be very slim at this stage, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/perfect-dark-actor-calls-on-fans-to-speak-up-and-help-the-game-survive">as our colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, there have been some surprising outcomes and scenarios before, such as when Microsoft folded Tango Gameworks (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>) and Krafton stepped in to revive the studio.</p>
<p>Of course, Regan's aim here is to simply get Perfect Dark fans to show their love for Joanna in hopes <em>something</em> might change or happen, or elevate the chances of someone stepping in to save the day – including the studio behind the cancelled project (<em>and dare we say Joanna's future</em>).</p>
<p>If you were about during the N64 generation, Agent Dark's 64-bit outing was one of the best experiences available on the platform. And although her latest project has been cancelled, you can still at least experience her classic first-person shooter on the Switch and Switch 2 via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack "Mature" app.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark isn't the only IP Microsoft has been accused of sitting on since acquiring the legendary British developer from Nintendo in the early 2000s. Although it did bring back <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> during the Xbox 360 generation, the famous bird and bear have been stashed away for a long time now – with many fans and former developers losing hope of a comeback.</p>
<p>Apart from Joanna's latest mission, Microsoft also cancelled Rare's next project <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a></strong> this week, a title that was originally announced more than five years ago.</p>

<p>Looking back on this week first, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> for the GameCube NSO app on Switch 2. It's a solid title, and you can see exactly where it lands in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">GameCube ranking for Switch 2</a> so far.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it emerged that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">Nintendo is facing a legal challenge from Brazil</a> thanks to its ability to ban Switch 2 consoles, while both major Zelda titles on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild-updates-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">received a cheeky little update</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is also facing a bit of controversy recently, with folks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">review-bombing the game</a> after Nintendo's latest update.</p>
<p>Reviews this week include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/chronicles_of_the_wolf">Chronicles of the Wolf</a>.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m off to see some friends this weekend and I know they haven’t played any Switch 2 yet.</p>
<p>So I’m packing up my dock and camera and I’m off to introduce everybody to the joys of Mario Kart World when you can see the faces of the racers in front of you. We’ll see whether they’re still my friends once Monday rolls around…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> recently, and although it's not my usual cup of tea, I'm actually having a blast with it.</p>
<p>I'm also playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> again on the Switch 2, taking full advantage of that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/22-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">bump up to 60fps</a>. And yes, I still love it.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Again. And probably will be until I get my hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a>. I'll be taking the Switch 2 with me on holiday next week, so it'll be the first time travelling with the console, and what better way to travel than to spend time levelling crafting jobs, eh?</p>
<p>Otherwise, some Mario Kart World with friends is in order. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is incredible how Next Level games kicked-off Super Mario Strikers so flawlessly from the opening whistle. Input and online latency aside, this will be quite good fun to spend some of the weekend’s gaming plans. Also: Sass. Every character is full of sass and attitude which was quite amusing to see back then – glad Nintendo allowed it.</p>
<p>I’ve made my way onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> chapter 10 during the week and things are quickly heating up with a setup for the inevitable Kiryu-Majima showdown. I’m unsure how long I have left to see the end credits on this excellent re-edition, but I’m sure it will be a really fun time.</p>
<p>And then there is the second Namco Model 22 Arcade Archives outing! Ace Combat 22 brings a ton of memories. While the game is a bit bare-bones (and most assuredly a coin muncher), the fact I used to play this at local sit-down arcade cabinet several months before even dreaming of owning Air Combat (which is quite a different experience despite sharing the core visuals) on the PS1 makes it quite special. Maybe I will actually complete Top Gun mode before I run out of coins.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> last weekend but I’m sure to correct that before Monday arrives. Dead or alive, someone is most definitely coming with me.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Lots on the menu this weekend. Can you believe we've had Switch 2 now for a whole month?</p>
<p>As ever, the question is whether I'll actually get to any of the games I plan on playing. I've got an appetite for a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, digging into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, and polishing off a dozen other things. I want to spend more time with the GameCube app, too.</p>
<p>But will I just end up noodling around in Mario Kart World picking up Peach coins and P Switches? Yes, that's almost certainly what I'll end up doing. Same time next week, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I recently got my hands on an <em>adorable</em> Xbox Series S, after years of wanting one but having no good reason to do so. This weekend I'm keen to put it through its paces, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> – whatever's modern and on GamePass really. What do you mean 'obviously this is preparation for a video'?</p>
<p>I'd ask you not to read too much into my personal affairs, thank you very much.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This weekend I'm on holiday in SPAIIIIN, which means being outside in 35°C heat. It's great. It's so great.</p><p>

Luckily for you readers, that means a lot of my time is spent inside in air-conditioned hotels and cafés, playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I'm about 30 days in, and let me tell you, it's a SLOW burn, but a good one. And it's genuinely quite funny to play the game as a <strong>Danganronpa</strong>/<strong>Zero Escape</strong> fan and see all the ways in which Hundred Line is exactly a mashup of those two, complete with a genuinely delightful amount of jokes about how it is exactly that. I mean, there's a character that keeps going on about how she hopes it's a killing game with students and an evil teddy bear mascot. Which it kind of is!</p><p>

It's great, though, despite the mildly tedious Danganronpa "improve your stats and figure out what gifts to give people" side quests. Only 70 more days to go (until I get to NG+, anyway)!</p></div>

<p><em>That's what we have planned for the weekend, but what about you? Let us know in the following poll which games you're planning on booting up over the next couple of days.</em></p>

<p>"More than 100 staff without jobs"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Romero Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62cb7c5b0b801/romero-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">@romerogamesltd</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been another tough week for the video game industry and the fallout from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-hit-with-layoffs-following-microsoft-xbox-cuts">Microsoft's layoffs led to funding cuts</a> at John and Brenda Romero's studio, Romero Games.</p>
<p>Now, following some claims the independant studio had completely shut its doors, Irish publication The Journal has got apparently got an official confirmation about this in a statement from Brenda Romero (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-shuttered-and-over-100-staff-axed-after-xbox-pulls-funding">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>It's mentioned how the decision was made at a "high level" within Microsoft and well above the studio's own "visibility and control".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time...We’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romero Games reportedly employed 42 studio members "directly", with its broader network for its latest project at "more than 100" people.</p>
<p>An "anonymous" staff member of the Galway-based studio told the source it's been a "big shock" as the team had only had meetings with its publisher the "day before this happened". There was also apparently no warning, and it's further claimed there are "no remaining funds to continue operations".</p>
<p>John Romero is one of the co-creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>, and the studio he co-founded with his wife went on to release multiple titles including the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> for the Switch in 2020. The same developer also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch-update-3-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">SIGIL and SIGIL 2</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>
