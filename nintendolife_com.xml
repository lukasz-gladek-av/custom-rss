<p>Buckle up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in 2021, Funselektor Labs brought us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>, a super sweet driving sim that packed an unexpected depth under the hood. Next year, the team will be following it up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/over-the-hill">over the hill</a>, an equally gorgeous-looking driver that's all about trekking <em>off</em> the beaten path. The really exciting news? It's coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>While art of rally was all about rally driving (surprisingly), over the hill is for the off-roading fans. You'll be sitting behind the wheel of a whole host of exploring vehicles from the '60s to '80s, making your way through unwelcoming wilderness environments from rocky mountains to icy rivers. You can go it alone in a Solo Tour, or bring three friends along for the ride and use winches and ropes to make sure everyone's drive goes smoothly.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped up in a similar simplistic art style to Funselektor's previous game, and a photo mode means you can capture the vistas in all their cel-shaded glory — increased car customisation should really help those snaps pop, too.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>- Explore the world in the golden age of offroading.<br></em><em>- Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery.<br></em><em>- Explore, navigate, and uncover the vast wilderness.<br></em><em>- Ramble your way through varied biomes inspired by real-world locations, from valleys to mountains and everything in between.<br></em><em>- Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try.<br></em><em>- Set up a campsite for some much-needed R&amp;R after a long day in the elements.<br></em><em>- Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation.<br></em><em>- Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer.<br></em><em>- Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still no specific release date for over the hill just yet, though the end of the console announcement trailer reveals that pre-orders for a physical edition will be coming soon — the premium version of which comes packaged with a window cling and soundtrack download card.</p>
<p>Our biggest gripe with art of rally was the visual cutbacks that had to be made to the Switch version of the game. With over the hill coming to Switch 2, let's keep our fingers crossed that Funselektor and Strelka Games can make the most of the increased power to keep things as stunning as they seem.</p>

<p>Crash might be back</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0f2acc3636fcb"><a title="Crash Bandicoot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f2acc3636fcb/crash-bandicoot.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot</a> has been revitalised over the past decade, and there are now reports Netflix has greenlit a new animated series.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">What's on Netflix</a>, this new series will apparently be created by WildBrain Studios, the same team behind <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81294811">Sonic Prime</a></strong>. Sonic's show had a three-season run, with 23 episodes in total between December 2022 and January 2024. This studio is also helping out with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series for Netflix.</p>
<p>Here's the full scoop about Crash's supposed animated series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's on Netflix:</strong> "Netflix isn’t done with bringing some of the most prolific video game adaptations to your screens. We’ve learned that Netflix has been quietly developing a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> animated series, which comes from the same studio as <em>Sonic Prime</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crash Bandicoot's most recent video game outing was the multiplayer-focused <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/crash_team_rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a> in 2023. Before this, fans got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, and the new entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>If we hear any official announcements or confirmation about this animation, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Out on Switch 2 next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Switch 2 has got off to a strong start with heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a>. Next up, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>'s turn in the brand new release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, the Koei Tecmo 'Warriors' spin-off series is back, following the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> on the original Switch system in 2020. This new outing, which takes place before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, is a canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda and many other familiar characters. It's also exclusive to Nintendo's new hybrid hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo Life contributor Lowell Bell <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-zelda-layton-mega-man-10-games-we-played-at-tgs-2025-coming-to-switch-1-and-2#hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2">went 'hands on' with this title</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September, and noted at the time how well this new musou ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first thing I noticed sitting down with the docked version is how well it ran. Age of Calamity was a stuttery mess on Switch 1 and I half expected to see slowdown as I swapped between Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru as they fought through waves of Little Frox and Soldier Constructs before taking on a boss Frox in the Depths beneath Hyrule."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's also been marketing the game with all sorts of trailers since the initial announcement in April of this year, and with the game due out next week on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>, we're now wondering what your own plans are - will you be getting it or are you going to give this one a miss? <em>So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

<p>We've got some exciting news for fighting game fans this week. Edia is teaming up with Takara Tomy to revive the 3D fighting game series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> on modern platforms.</p>
<p>This includes <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></strong> (1995), <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_2">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</a></strong> (1995), and <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_3">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</a></strong> (1996). The aim is to release ports of these titles between "fiscal [year] 2026 and 2027". Here's the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will begin developing ports of contracted titles for current consoles, aiming for release between fiscal 2026 and 2027. We will utilize our accumulated know-how in porting and commercializing retro games to advance product planning, aiming to create products that will not only be ports but also be enjoyed by many fans. Further details regarding the product lineup will be announced as they are decided."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>No platforms have been revealed just yet, but Edia is the same company behind crowdfunded revivals and Switch releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valis_the_fantasm_soldier_collection">Valis: The Fantasm Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>Battle Arena Toshinden first started on the PlayStation in 1995, around the same time as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> series, and is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/the-battle-arena-toshinden-trilogy-is-coming-to-modern-platforms"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlight, there was even a <a href="https://youtu.be/a8pxUyuwrW4?t=118">2D Game Boy release</a> in 1996</p>

<p>This time, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> album from the DS generation. This platformer was originally released in 2006, and the update today features "all tracks" from this title. This includes <strong>60 tracks</strong> in total, with a runtime of 1 hour and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>To listen to this music on this app, you first need to have either the Android or iOS version of the app, and you'll also be required to have an active Switch Online membership. Some of the existing DS albums available on the Nintendo Music service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tomodachi_collection">Tomodachi Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from these weekly updates to the Nintendo Music app, Nintendo has also been updating its digital retro libraries. Later this week, on 30th October 2025, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> game will be joining the GameCube's Nintendo Classics library. This game's soundtrack was also added to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-music-adds-luigis-spooky-gamecube-soundtrack-heres-every-song-included">Nintendo Music service earlier this year</a>.</p>
