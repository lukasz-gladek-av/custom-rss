<figure><a title="eShop Selects June 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3be05fd374dba/eshop-selects-june-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well well well — one month with the Switch 2, and we're <em>still</em> swimming in eShop games. Yep, it's time for eShop Selects for June 2025!</p>
<p>Who needs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> when you've got backwards compatibility, eh? Just because we have a new console, doesn't mean we're <em>just</em> looking at Switch 2 games. And going forward, eShop Selects will be looking at eShop games on both consoles.</p>
<p>So, let's run down the rules quickly; Game Key-Card and Code In Box releases won't be included here, only eShop exclusives (at least in the West). Where a digital-only game has a Switch 1 and Switch 2 version, we'll be focusing on the Switch 2 version. And we know some of these are and might get a limited physical down the line, but for now, they're digital only, so they do count.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067itlsqn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Okay. Other than that, things are basically the same — we ask our writers and contributors to pick their top three eShop games from June 2025 from what we reviewed, and the games with the highest total scores will make our top three. It's a strong month this time around, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:184784,184489 @ 1751817626 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Eleven games made the cut this time around, with the new console ushering in some new exclusives and upgraded titles. But most of these <em>are</em> Switch 1 games, of course. Hooray for being able to play old games on the new system!</p>
<p>A busy month, unsurprisingly, then! Note that No Man's Sky isn't here because it has a Switch 1 physical. Otherwise, here's what didn't quite make our top three, and as always, there's a ton of variety here.</p>

</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">3rd Place - Deltarune</a></h2>
<p>Even though we've got at least three chapters left, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> still absolutely rules.</p>
<p>All three of our podium finishers are Switch 2 launch titles, and Deltarune — along with the new chapters 3 and 4 — was maybe the most surprising. Deltarune may have started way back in 2018, but the two new chapters may well be the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is this writer's favourite, balancing brand new gameplay styles with hilarious characters and a shocking end. Chapter 5 comes in 2026, and we can't wait. We gave the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">first four chapters an 8/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:184454,183380 @ 1751817626 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">2nd Place - Fast Fusion</a></h2>
<p>Shin’en has done it again; Fast Fusion is a stand-out launch title, even alongside the beautiful Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>If you need a game to demonstrate the Switch 2's graphical capabilities (that isn't Cyberpunk), then Fast Fusion is it. It looks <em>stunning</em> both docked and handheld, and is the current hardcore racers' choice on the new console. Plus, you can play it with a friend on Switch 1 with GameShare.</p>
<p>While it's largely a refinement of what came before, with a few new mechanics sprinkled in, Fast Fusion is a must-buy for the Switch 2, and one of the cheapest games to pick up right now, too. We scored this one a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">well-deserved 9/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:183389,184310 @ 1751817626 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a></h2>
<p>Just weeks after launch on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> got a Switch 2 Edition, and — lo and behold — it's outstanding. Because we were still working on our review in May's eShop Selects, and the Switch 2 version was looming, we decided to hold the game back for June's edition. And, well, we may as well invent a new life for the game — Champion.</p>
<p>Level-5 has cemented its return with a huge time sink that's incredibly difficult to put down, once it has its hooks in you. While it may not have the narrative depth of the 3DS game, there is <em>so</em> much to do, and it never gets boring. You can decorate an entire island, journey through a huge open world, spend hours fishing and crafting, or attempt to level every single Life. It's a staggering achievement, and there's still more to come, including DLC.</p>
<p>We scored Fantasy Life i <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 9/10</a>, and it's our eShop Selects June 2025 winner!</p>

<p>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-june-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching the same month as CrossWorlds</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega is promoting its upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> in all sorts of ways, and apart from the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/wait-busted-member-is-the-singer-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-opening">opening theme reveal earlier this week</a>, it's also recently teased a new animation.</p>
<p>This new animation celebrating Sonic's latest racing game is scheduled to arrive this September (the same month as the game), and this initial preview was originally featured at Anime Expo. It shows Sonic and Shadow speeding along, but we don't get much else.</p>
<p>Sega released a two-part animated series for the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/team_sonic_racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. And more recently it released its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-episode-3-is-out-now">Dark Beginnings animation</a> to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> (which is now also available on the Switch 2).</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch for the Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, with the Switch 2 version of this new game to arrive at a "later date", with a paid upgrade path also planned.</p>

<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64677a195d6b9/star-wars-rogue-squadron-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello there, young Padawans, are you ready to continue your training in the art of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>?</p>
<p>Before we become one with the Force, let's look back to last week, where we saw a duel (of the fates) between two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>. It was the European and Japanese cover that took the high ground in the end, snatching up 61% of the vote compared to North America's 39%. *<em>Insert falling LEGO Yoda sound effect here</em>*</p>
<p>This time, we're heading back to a galaxy far, far away — <em>yipee!</em> — as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</a>, on the N64. While perhaps not <em>quite</em> as beloved as its GameCube sequel, this high-octane flight combat game gave us all the Star Wars kick we so desperately craved in the late '90s, and <em>man,</em> did we pour the hours into it!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>There are just the two covers to check out this time (no more, no less), so let's see which will become the Master, and which the Apprentice...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:123791 @ 1751817644 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79631c29329f4/star-wars-rogue-squadron-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, now there's a piece of art! The X-Wing takes centre stage, naturally, but the European and North American covers are all about the dogfighting. It's one of those where you spot more the longer you look. The TIE Fighter exploding in the background, the AT-ATs destroying Mos Eisley down below, all realised in a sweet painterly style. It's a good 'un, we've got to say.</p>
<p>Of course, the European variant was also home to the classic black border around the edge, but the art is identical, so we're not splitting them in two this time.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98f26850baff1/star-wars-rogue-squadron-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover is darker and more stripped back than the previous one we looked at, subbing the '<em>action everywhere!</em>' approach for a simple one-on-one between an X-Wing and a TIE Fighter. The attempt to go more realistic with the visuals means time hasn't been too kind to this one, but we appreciate the gloomy vibes it's going for. And hey, the ship 'blueprints' on the top and bottom of the box are cool.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-star-wars-rogue-squadron]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">same interview with Wccftech</a>, the Virtuos team was asked how the new Nintendo device holds up in terms of "raw console performance" and if it's closer to an Xbox Series S or PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>According to Eoin O'Grady, who is technical director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos studio and subsidiary), it's a bit of both, depending on what aspect of the hardware you're looking at. The GPU in the Switch 2 apparently performs "slightly below" the Series S (but does come with some added technologies) and as for the CPU, the Switch 2 is supposedly "closer" to the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Here's O'Grady's response in full, which also goes into how the experience might be for developers porting their current games to Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>"GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>
<p>"CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows companies like Koei Tecmo suggesting Nintendo's new hybrid system was closer to an Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power". Other companies like Firaxis (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/civilization-vii-dev-likens-games-switch-2-graphical-performance-to-mid-tier-pc">have also chimed in</a> with their own development experiences. Nvidia (the creator of the Switch 2 chip) even labelled it a "technical marvel" and "unlike anything" it's ever built before.</p>

<p>"The handheld market is growing right now"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aec7c2409cab/star-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One company that backed the Switch throughout its life was the port specialist Virtuos – working on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> for the hybrid platform. It might just be the beginning of the Switch 2's life, but the same team is already sounding confident about the new hardware's future.</p>
<p>Speaking to Wccftech recently, Eoin O'Grady – the technical director of Virtuos' subsidiary Black Shamrock (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starlink_battle_for_atlas">Starlink: Battle for Atlas</a>) – believes the Switch 2 will "surpass" the success of the original system.</p>
<p>He believes the "growth" in the handheld gaming market right now (thanks to devices like the original Switch and Steam Deck) will help the Switch 2's success, and it can feed off this "growing demand for gaming on the go" with a combination of "indie gems", "Nintendo exclusives" and "now AAA blockbuster titles".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now...so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos' North America director of business development Alex Heise adds to this – highlighting how the "strong brand" and "proven success" of the original Switch system with a "2" attached to the name should make the value of the new device "immediately clear" compared to certain <em>other</em> Nintendo systems of the past.</p>
<p>He says how although nobody probably "fully predicted" the Switch 2 would become the "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">fastest-selling console launch of all-time</a>", Virtuos still had high expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console ever had a '2' in its name".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo confirmed its new hybrid hardware had sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days of the system's life – also making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em>. As of March 31, 2025, the original Switch has now sold more than 152 million units worldwide over eight years.</p>
<p>Other third-party developers showing their support for the Switch 2 include companies like CD Projekt Red (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>) and Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>).</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36bf257cba01c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Yes, believe it or not, it's been a full month since the launch of the Switch 2 - it's certainly been a busy few weeks. Now that the dust has settled, let's take a look back at how the long-awaited console came out of the gate, from the perspective of Nintendo, players, and media...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Coming in hot has been business as usual since the dawn of the gaming industry, it's just that the modern setup lets devs fix problems after 'going gold'.</p>
<p>Depressing as it is as a player, 'ship first, patch later' is the norm and these days that goes for hardware, too. Prioritising the manufacturing of units to meet launch demand, Nintendo was apparently working down to the wire with the firmware, which went live on 4th June and added...well, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68526">everything</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this approach ensures that nothing's going to leak, right? Unfortunately, it means enthusiast media gets left out in the cold at a time when outlets are dropping like flies and sites of all sizes are left scrambling to get coverage live for readers in the post-launch hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<p>'Suboptimal' is a polite word I find myself using a lot these days, and everyone on the NL team — and at gaming outlets everywhere — has done an incredible job over the past month. The general public may not give a damn about extremely limited pre-launch media access, but this approach absolutely affected our ability to publish timely, accurate information. Questions that could have been asked and answered weeks or <em>months</em> before got stirred into the launch frenzy, leading to confusion on all sides that could have been avoided.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:183286 @ 1751818769 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd3a91f03dd4/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, it's Nintendo's prerogative to prioritise public-facing Switch 2 Experiences over media access — specialist or otherwise — and to be fair, the, er, 'suboptimal' economic situation in the US and the associated pricing and distribution challenges thrown up at the 11th hour meant that, from a business POV, the company had bigger worries than sending out review hardware.</p>
<p>Printed Mario Kart World game codes apparently inserted into standard solo system boxes (to convert them into bundles, versus 'native' bundles where the code is tied to the system itself and auto-redeemed to your Nintendo Account once you access the eShop) suggests a quick pivot to account for the enormous interest in the MK bundle SKU.</p>
<p>Arguably, the company rolled with the unpredictable tariff punches fairly well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-the-switch-2-pre-order-situation-sucks-but-can-nintendo-do-anything-about-it">juggling retailer and customer expectations</a> with pre-order delays in North America while keeping its messaging as clear as possible. Anecdotally, almost nobody I know who wanted a Switch 2 at launch failed to get one, and although we could all do without the stress of F5-ing webpages — and some regions fared better than others (with plenty of Japanese fans not having lottery luck <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand">as demand exceeded supply</a>) — on the whole, Nintendo did a decent job getting consoles into players' hands on 5th June.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184232 @ 1751819588 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9c222bfb50b6/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tariff situation exacerbated general discontent over pricing, though. While on the higher end of estimates, the $450 price tag wasn't unexpected, but compounded with the sticker shock of an $80 launch game, the indignance over charging $10 for an obvious pack-in title, and Nintendo taking time to clarify confusion around NS2 Editions and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a>, conditions were perfect for a social media storm when all the accessories got price-hiked in the US. The continued threat of prices <em>increasing</em> over time made stressed gamers anxious to get in early, too, before the thing gets even more expensive.</p>
<p>'Stressed' is the word. It was a <em>stressful</em> launch for everyone, to varying degrees. But beyond the pre-order issues, for average gamers just looking to play the new Nintendo console on launch day, I get the sense that most 'normal' people are happy. Blimey, imagine that!</p>
<p>Sales numbers certainly indicate enthusiasm, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units sold in its first four days</a>, setting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">all-time records in the US</a> and making the system the fastest-selling ever globally. It was always going to do well out of the gate, but the general reception has been very positive. I don't see Nintendo having much trouble <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">hitting its forecasted sales of 15 million</a> in the first year.</p>
<p>That's not to say that every aspect of the hardware and software has hit for everyone. Sticking with the system itself for a moment, people have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-switch-2-battery-reportedly-lasting-under-two-hours-with-mario-kart-how-is-yours-holding-up">disappointed by the battery life</a>, and the screen is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">a point of contention</a>, too, and not just because it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-has-your-switch-2s-screen-got-any-nasty-scratches-yet">easy to scratch</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry's legitimate criticism of LCD blur</a>, in particular, saw the Nintendo Defence Force leaping to the company's defence with all the nuanced discussion and debate you'd expect on social media.</p>
<p>From Team NL's perspective, beyond missing the contrast of the OLED screen, blur isn't something we've had issues with in the main. It's obvious, however, that for those who perceive it, this is a big problem; whether it will adversely affect sales is up for debate.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the fan furore over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> not being a pack-in felt more a byproduct of pricing grumbles than indignation that would genuinely influence console purchase decisions. As I said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">my review</a>, of course it should have been a pack-in, but it's a long way from a deal-breaking issue. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">criticism of Mario Kart World's 'intermission' tracks</a> and mixed feelings about the open-world aspect have hardly blemished the system's launch; it's still a tremendous game and it'll no doubt be getting updates for years to come.</p>
<p>And looking at the broader software lineup, while writers and hardcore players with access to other consoles might find the offering lacklustre, there will be millions of players for whom Cyberpunk and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> are as fresh as the new Mario Kart, too. it’s easy to dismiss them as old news, but those are both <em>phenomenal</em> games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">Reports</a> have suggested that third-party sales were dismal, but the third-party share was also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">apparently better than on Switch 1</a>. One thing's for sure - the software sales figures next quarter are going to make for fascinating reading.</p>
<p>Stand back and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">look at the 25-strong lineup</a>, though — with all-timers like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> providing support — and it’s hard to imagine a better Day One selection than this. You've got quality and quantity. Another job done from Nintendo's point of view.</p>

<p>Yes, a new 3D Mario would have launched the thing in spectacular fashion. We all love a genre-definer to kick things off — a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a> or a BOTW — and Mario Kart World certainly isn't that. Yet with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team confirmed as devs on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">SMB</a>'s 40th anniversary coming up, even if the next 3D Mario <em>is</em> still a ways off, there are quality first-party games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's launch wasn't without missteps and frustrations, then, but as a cold, calculated execution of a long-term strategy which involves iterating on a winning formula, Nintendo went for the jugular while pacing itself for the turbulent generation ahead. Ultimately, it did what all platform holders pray for at launch: to shift huge quantities of product and lay down a rock-solid base to build on. Grousing around the media approach and a price point that birthed a hashtag aside, it's been a good few weeks for Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>All eyes are on the next Nintendo Direct, but it's hard to argue that the launch was anything but a big success. And with DK Bananza in the chamber, the future is looking bright.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the polls how well you think Nintendo handled the Switch 2 launch and if you're satisfied with your still-quite-new console.</em></p>
