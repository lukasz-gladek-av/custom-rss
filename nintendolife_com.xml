<p>Looking for a pick-me-up on a chilly morning (or afternoon, or whenever you happen to be reading this)? This five-minute arrangement of classic Koji Kondo tracks from the Mario series just might do the trick.</p>
<p>Recorded back on 23rd August, the WDR Funkhausorchester takes a delightfully brisk jog through some classic platforming tunes, spanning 1985's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> (yes, that is now retro, folks) by way of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">SMB3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a>.</p>
<p>It's such a short and sweet arrangement that you may not want the included pieces spoiled. We'll put the timestamped titles at the bottom of the article, though - scroll down if you want 'em.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with this orchestra's oeuvre, the <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/orchester-und-chor/funkhausorchester/index.html">West German Broadcasting Cologne orchestra</a> has a broader focus beyond Classical...er, classics. So, in amongst your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0Ys6caA_o">Blue Danubes</a> and your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_i-CEoVQs">Paso Dobles</a>, they like to mix in some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mU41YusfQ">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkdCADxlYXs">Great Giana Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>And no, <em>Funkhausorchester</em> doesn't mean 'Funk House Orchestra'. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this cropped up on our feed and made us smile, so we thought we'd share. Let us know below if it gave a wee power-up on a Tuesday AM.</p>

<p>The rumours about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> getting ported to Nintendo's Switch successor have been doing the rounds on the internet for some time now.</p>
<p>In an update on this, podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' has responded to a recent comment <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1974887737678553101">on social media</a>, claiming the Switch 2 version does indeed "exist" (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/they-exist-red-dead-redemption-2s-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2-versions-are-still-happening-its-claimed/">thanks for the heads up, VGC</a>). As for the timing of the release, he's got no news to share at this stage.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b546e6866da9a"><a title="Red Dead Redemption 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b546e6866da9a/red-dead-redemption-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / via X</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">a rumour in May</a>, which reported "sources close to Rockstar Games" had indicated that the second entry starring Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang would be released on the Switch 2 within the current fiscal year - so, <em>before</em> the end of March 2026.</p>
<p>Rockstar is already gearing up for a huge 2026 after it announced the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/grand-theft-auto-6-has-been-delayed-and-will-now-launch-in-may-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> earlier this year. This anticipated release will now launch for Xbox and PlayStation platforms next year on 26th May.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> game was ported to the Switch in 2023. You can check out our review here on Nintendo Life for more information.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're still on the hunt for certain Switch 2 accessories and are looking for alternatives to Nintendo's products, there are plenty of third-party offerings already popping up. Accessory maker Turtle Beach recently released a headset, and it has now announced multiple other products.</p>
<p>This includes a new range of wired and wireless controllers, cases, and screen protectors. There's the Rematch, Afterglow Wave and Afterglow controllers, as well as a PlayTrek 2-in-1 Case and cases for the standalone system.</p>
<p>Controllers start at $29.99 / £24.99 wired, and will set you back $64.99 / £54.99 for a wireless one. Apart from different models (including features like Hall-Effect thumbsticks, RGB, and a GameChat button), there are also different designs available. The two-in-one PlayTrek carry case costs $49.99 / £39.99 and travel cases are priced between $19.99 / £14.99 - $29.99 / £19.99.</p>


<p>All of these are officially licensed products and pre-orders for these products are NOW <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2">live on the Turtle Beach website</a>. We also reviewed the company's Switch 2 headset not long ago, and thought it was a great budget accessory. Here's a quick summary, in case you missed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>There'll be no music updates next week</p>

<figure data-uuid="db765c62789c9"><a title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db765c62789c9/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fan favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> made its grand return last May, and in an update to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today, the game's soundtrack has <em>finally</em> been added.</p>
<p>This includes not only the <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/d87d523c-cb7c-4412-aafd-fa668b65defd">Switch version</a> of the soundtrack but also the original <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/1b466e17-95ee-4c62-9b97-14b4d7152cd8">GameCube album</a>. The Switch album is apparently loaded with a whopping 275 tracks, and there are 111 songs for the classic GameCube release.</p>
<p>Before you begin your jam session, just so you know - Nintendo won't be releasing any new tracks on the service next week. It didn't provide a specific reason for this, but there's a national holiday in Japan next week. It skipped weekly updates previously, which have also lined up with public holidays.</p>

<p>If you didn't play Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door back in the day, or haven't tried out the Switch version just yet, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We said it was still the king of Mario's RPG outings. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For 20 years, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the best Mario RPG of all time, and the Switch remake proves it has earned that title. This is a fantastic RPG adventure, whether you’re a Mario fan or not, with some best-in-class combat, brilliant writing, and a few little creases ironed out to make this the definitive way to play Thousand-Year Door."</p>

<p>Thankfully, it's not a "major" delay</p>

<figure data-uuid="30d0aa4f33500"><a title="Mina The Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30d0aa4f33500/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games' new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> was on track for a 31st October 2025 release, but it seems the plans have now changed.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the company's website, the "delay extravanganza" continues – with the team behind this new retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">Zelda</a>-inspired adventure having to make the "tough decision" to delay the title on Switch, Switch 2, and all other platforms, as "it's just not quite there yet". Fortunately, this delay isn't a major one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbekurwzx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p>
<p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p>
<p>The game is <em>so</em> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p>
<p>- Finalizing design, art, and sound<br>
- Overall game balancing<br>
- Implementing localization<br>
- Eating cheese<br>
- Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there's no new release date just yet, but again, it sounds like fans won't have to wait too long, as it's adding the final polish to select areas to make the game "truly shine". The original launch date was previously revealed in August of this year, and alongside it was the launch of a free demo, which will even carry over save data to the final build.</p>
<p>Over the past month, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> have also been delayed.</p>
