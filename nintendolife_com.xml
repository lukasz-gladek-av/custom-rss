<figure data-uuid="f277304b26af4"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f277304b26af4/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>September 2025 feels like an awful long time ago. It was in this Direct that we first locked eyes on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and while the marketing hasn't been all that in-yer-face in the months since, the occasional trailer drop or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> update has kept us eager to learn what Mario's latest sporting escapade would bring to the table.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's not long to wait. Fever launches on Switch 2 later this week on <strong>12th February</strong>, and today, we can start to get an idea of the critical consensus as the reviews start rolling in.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a great time with just about everything the game served up to us. While the wonderful PJ O'Reilly was a little let down by the single-player Adventure Mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">our 8/10 review</a>, he found that there was a lot to like about the central tennis matches and their wacky Fever mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's lucky, given the disappointing adventure offering, that the tennis here is so sweet, and easily the sort of thing I reckon has a long online life ahead. It helps, too, that it looks superb, never dropping a notable frame in docked or handheld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But of course, we're not the only ones with a review out there. Below, we've assembled a roundup to help you see the breadth of opinions at a glance — and yes, there are quite a few different takes on this one.</p>
<p>Kicking things off at the top with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-scores-ace-pinpoint-precision-507991-20260210">GAMINGbible</a>, which awarded Fever a 9/10 thanks to its fun-filled whimsy and the "pleasant surprise" of its short-but-sweet Adventure Mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its surprisingly charming Adventure Mode and more match variations than you could possibly imagine, <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is a bountifully delightful release that conjures up the pure, whimsical escapism that only Nintendo so wonderfully nails</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/mario-tennis-fever-review-3315802/">Dexerto</a> was similarly optimistic in its 4/5 review, describing Fever as "the most fun sports game in years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As chaotic as Mario Kart, it stands alongside the likes of Mario Golf Toadstool Tour and Mario Strikers Charged as the best Mario sports games. It’s completely thrilling</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-bringing-the-heat/1900-6418460/">GameSpot</a> also came in with an 8/10, praising the arcade-y addition of the special-powered rackets and the sheer variety of gameplay options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario's various dalliances into sports have been inconsistent, often because they feel so bare-bones and perfunctory. Mario Tennis Fever breaks this trend with a multitude of modes and a playful, flexible gimmick that makes it more wild and unpredictable while also testing your tennis skills in a new way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things were marginally lower in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/running-hot">Game Informer</a>'s 7.5/10 review, which still found a lot to like about Fever despite an all-too-short Adventure Mode and some occasional stutters in the review-period online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever is hardly a revolutionary entry, but it nails the series' most important element by offering a well-rounded experience with myriad ways for players of all skill levels to enjoy the game of tennis</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For many of the same reasons, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-review">IGN</a> awarded Fever a 7/10, where the stellar party vibes and stacked character roster are only let down by the single-player content and occasional repetitiveness of certain modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 20 hours, I already feel like I’ve had my fill, and I see it as more of a fun distraction to play for a few minutes here and there while my group warms up for something else rather than one that’s going to get a serious amount of playtime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/">VGC</a>, which gave Fever a "solid" 3/5 on account of that much-discussed Adventure Mode and the risk of things becoming rather unbalanced in online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before long, you’ll realise that of the 30 rackets on offer, less than a third of them can have a major impact on the game. I’d imagine that once the online community turns up, it’ll only be a matter of time before the metagame kicks in and the vast majority of these rackets are dismissed in favour of the handful that have the most obvious advantage</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There you have it, not the most divisive game in recent memory, but certainly a good range of opinions — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-tennis-fever/">Metascore</a> of 77 based on 64 critic reviews.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see it all for yourself later this week, when Mario Tennis Fever arrives on 12th February.</p>
