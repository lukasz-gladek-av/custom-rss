<p>We shouldn't be surprised, but oof</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="SMG + SMG2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0c3f17aee1bd/smg-plus-smg2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's store pages are live for the freshly announced, repetitiously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, and <em>woof</em>, if you thought Nintendo was pushing it with $80 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World,</a> maybe go and fetch something to calm your nerves.</p>
<p>In the US, the bundle containing both Wii games — remastered and including extra content and amiibo functionality — will set you back $70, physical or digital. It's listed for £58.99 in the UK, although we've yet to confirm if that applies to physical too.</p>
<p>Both games are available separately (digitally) on the eShop, too, for $39.99 / £33.99 each. All versions launch on <strong>2nd October</strong>.</p>
<p><em>"But they're two of the very best games of all time!"</em> says Nintendo, probably. And absolutely, it's hard to argue with that! They're both 10/10 masterpieces. But blimey. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/video_does_super_mario_galaxy_2_on_wii_u_offer_anything_new">We remember</a> back on Wii U Virtual Console when these were re-released at the discounted price of £8.99 before going up to £17.99.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61242558757c5/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915406.html">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lest we forget, Nintendo isn't just putting out the same old ROMs this time, with significantly more work going into this Galaxy port than last time the game appeared on Switch as part of the limited-time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> compilation (which omitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 2</a>). These games will have some new content included. Also, although they're launching for Switch 1, a free update will bump up the resolution to 4K docked, 1080p handheld on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, though. For people who already own Galaxy on Switch who are looking to complete the set, 34 quid for the sequel is significant, however enhanced it is.</p>
<p><em>Or is it? It is one of the best video games ever made! Let us know your thoughts — and if you'll be picking one or both of the games up — in the comments.</em></p>

<figure><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b23b80c8f7138/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following confirmation that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>, Square Enix has announced that the entire remake trilogy will make its way to Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>So, this includes the aforementioned Remake Intergrade, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the as-yet unconfirmed third entry. There's no release window as of yet, but it's great to finally get official confirmation regardless.</p>

<p>It's also been confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be a Game-Key Card release on the Switch 2, so it's reasonable to assume that the two sequels will also utilise the controversial medium for their respective releases.</p>

<p>It's the best one!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The really rather frightening <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</a></strong> is getting a fancy remake. Hooray! Team Ninja is involved. Hooray again! And it's headed to Switch 2 in 2026. Ok that's terrifying, but also hooray...we guess.</p>
<p>This Japanese horror effort, which scared this writer good and proper back when it released for the first time in 2003, is looking like a right atmospheric treat in its fancy new trailer, which you can check out above, and the creepy tale should benefit greatly from the added horsepower of the Switch 2, after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/project_zero_2_wii_edition">Wii port</a> back in the day that was, well it was fine, but it wasn't the best way to play it.</p>

<p>From former Bungie CEO's new studio</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love the 80s. We love anime. We love them there computer games.</p>
<p>And so, it stands to reason, there's a fair chance we could end up loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, a rather retro-cool-looking 2D action roguelike that's available for Switch today. Exciting!</p>
<p>Today's surprise stealth drop, of a game that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch">announced a little while back now</a>, sees players blast through a campaign in either solo mode or couch co-op. It looks very like a 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/borderlands_collection_pandoras_box">Borderlands</a> to us in its art style, weapon pick-up descriptions and enemies, which is no bad thing, and the trailer - which you can check out above - shows a decent mix of platforming, boss battling and so on.</p>
<p>The roguelike aspect here comes through the use of "storm hearts", hence the title, which can be upgraded through play for permanent unlocks to carry into your next run. Of course this is also the first game from ProbablyMonsters, so we're very interested to see how it turns out for them.</p>
