<p>Retro isometric puzzle sweetness incoming!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We really enjoyed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lumo">Lumo</a> when it launched on Switch back in 2017, awarding the isometric action-puzzler <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/lumo">an 8/10</a> and saying that it "provides a modern isometric platformer, offering (as you'd expect) improved audio-visual presentation over the classics of the genre, whilst still providing the same kind of entertainment."</p>
<p>Numskull has announced that the sequel, aptly named <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumo_2">Lumo 2</a>, will launch on Switch on <strong>17th October</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, if you're around the same sort of age as this writer, you'll get a warm and fuzzy feeling inside whilst checking out the new trailer for the game (above), as just like its predecessor, Lumo 2 seems intent on reviving this lost-but-very-much-still-loved 'sub-genre' from an unnecessarily early grave. Yes, that's right, bring back the iso-action-puzzler, and do it this instant. Please.</p>
<p>Lumo 2 comes in both digital and physical flavours, with a deluxe physical edition rocking a soundtrack cassette and "other retro goodies", in an '80s-themed collector’s box. Digital will set you back <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Lumo-2-2897116.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq1-0-59adaTlVn8ka3KrESQM846ZPam5ryA_Iu2Cf9KUagzP3d">£19.99 / €22.99 / $24.99</a>, whereas the standard physical comes in at £34.99 / €39.99. And that snazzy collector's box is £49.99 / €59.99.</p>

<p>With plenty of nods to classics of the genre, and gaming culture of the period, there should be plenty to enjoy here when the game drops in a few weeks. For now, though, here's more from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lumo 2 is a love letter to the 8-bit era and to the Golden Age of British gaming – so expect collectibles galore and retro-inspired isometric visuals, all with the polished mechanics of a modern platformer.</p>
<p>In Lumo 2, players can experience:<br>
- Retro‑inspired puzzle platforming - A modern sequel built on the charm and artistry of early isometric British classics<br>
- Classic Collectibles - Collect 25 vintage cassettes and 20 ducks hidden in inventive locations, rewarding exploration and persistence<br>
- Evolving Gameplay - Traverse over 100 shifting dimensions and portals; mini-games and genre-bending levels surprise around every corner"</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eaea1e2008977/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all waited a whopping seven years to get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and what has been <em>the</em> talking point in the weeks following its release? The difficulty.</p>
<p>With tricky bosses, perilous platforming and some meaty runbacks, many have found Silksong to be a touch too tricky at launch — even after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-patch-will-nerf-the-difficulty-in-certain-areas">swift update</a> sought to lessen the blow of select early encounters — and now, Team Cherry has addressed the hot topic in a recent discussion at an ACMI Game Worlds exhibition in Australia (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067isgqpt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"Silksong has moments of steep difficulty," Team Cherry's Ari Gibson told the exhibition's co-creator Jini Maxwell, "but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you're going and what you're doing".</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson continued. "One player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes".</p>
<p>This approach makes a lot of sense. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, there <em>is</em> help to be found with Silksong's trickier moments, if you know where to look. If a boss battle or particular platforming challenge isn't working out for you, then the best idea is probably to get back to exploring for a while.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent players "getting stonewalled" by a particular challenge, Gibson stated, so the team ensured that "[players] have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely".</p>

<p>This isn't to say that all challenges can be overcome by mere exploration alone, mind you. "Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight," Gibson said of the core changes in the sequel, "so even the base enemies had to be more complicated, more intelligent".</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of these core enemies borrowed from the original Hollow Knight to really sell the step up in challenge. "The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," revealed Team Cherry's William Pellen, "in contrast to the Knight's enemies, Hornet's enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away".</p>
<p>It's brutal and punishing at times, but that didn't stop us from having a <em>wonderful</em> time with Silksong. We called the long-awaited sequel "a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>, which you can read in full below.</p>
