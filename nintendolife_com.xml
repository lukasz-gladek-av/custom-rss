<figure><a title="The Hobbit - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3feb88263158c/the-hobbit-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Assemble your best team of warriors, kings, wizards and burglars, because it's time to embark on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a> adventure.</p>
<p>But before Gandalf comes a-knocking, let's take a look at what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-blast-corps">last week</a>, when we matched up two different covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>. In the battle of East and West, Japan came out on top, with the badass 'Blastdozer' cover taking 58% of the vote and leaving Europe and North America with the remaining 42%.</p>
<p>If you hadn't guessed it by now, we're taking a trip to Middle Earth this week (what can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a> has put us in the mood for something... else) as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> on Game Boy Advance. Now, is it the best LOTR game out there? Not by a long shot, but it throws up two drastically different cover designs, so prepare for some whiplash.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0oqpwky&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11cbe1e5d1144/the-hobbit-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might expect the design for a game of The Hobbit — a <em>children's</em> book, let's not forget — to be bright, colourful, and full of fun. Not in the West, it seems. The North American and European design is all about the gloom, with slightly uncanny Bilbo standing front and centre, and uncanny Gandalf and Smaug looming behind.</p>
<p>Despite the gloominess, we quite like the design on this one. It promises drama and adventure in a way that the game never really delivered on, but there's no denying that ol' Mr Baggins looks rather heroic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82f3b73c9548d/the-hobbit-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, now <em>this</em> is something else entirely. The Japanese design goes ham with the bright colours, placing Bilbo, Gandalf and Smaug (now joined by Gollum) in broad daylight, with the Lonely Mountain and Mirkwood backdrop not looking quite so menacing. The One Ring also makes an appearance on this one, you know, if you were curious <em>which</em> Hobbit the game was about.</p>

<p>And it's now live</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> arrived on the Switch late last year and it's received some updates since then including a performance boost.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, the developer has announced it's released a new patch for the Switch version, which brings it up to date with the PC release. You can see these previous patch updates for PC <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1887400/allnews/">via the game's Steam Page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch patch is now LIVE! Thanks everyone for your patience. This update brings the Switch version up to date with the PC release. Enjoy!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't tried out Antonblast yet, there's a demo you can check out. The game is also currently on sale in select regions, and you can read our full review here on Nintendo Life for more information. We gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it a great tribute to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wario_land_shake_it">Wario Land</a> series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether on Switch or elsewhere, we’d suggest you pick this one up if you’re at all a fan of Nintendo’s <em>other</em> Italian mascot and are looking for a well-made and fast-paced new 2D platformer"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79ddf65dd41c1/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Two of my favourite games growing up were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>. Lush green worlds, curious — and sometimes cute — enemies, and fluid action combat for the time; as someone who had largely only played turn-based RPGs for the first eight years of their life, the SNES era of action RPGs showed me a glimpse of what video games were capable of. These games in particular made me feel bold and adventurous, and whenever I revisit them as an adult, they fill me with a childlike sense of wonder.</p>
<p>So I am very much the target audience for the upcoming action RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>. I adore HD-2D, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a> is one of my favourite Switch games and RPGs of all time. But at the same time, I wanted Team Asano and Square Enix to do something a little different with this beautiful art style; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-it-time-for-hd-2d-to-take-a-break">I was a little worried about the direction it seemed to be taking</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I wasted no time downloading the demo after the July Partner Showcase, and even after spending two hours with it, and recognising a few kinks that need to be ironed out, The Adventures of Elliot feels like a shot in the arm for this aesthetic style, and I'm itching for more.</p>

<p>Like Octopath before it, The Adventures of Elliot is aiming to recapture some of that SNES magic, but in the action department rather than the turn-based. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/illusion_of_gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/terranigma">Terranigma</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ys_iii_wanderers_from_ys">Ys III</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Beyond Oasis</a>; all of that ilk feed into top-down Japanese-developed action RPG history, and it's on show here. But the Zelda love is overwhelming — after all, the eponymous hero is wearing red instead of green, he has a fairy companion, you can throw pots... it's all here, just with a few unique wrinkles.</p>
<p>The best part of the Debut Demo is the world itself. Exploring this small corner of Philabieldia (not a typo) is extremely moreish for me, and gives us a little insight into what's to come. Of course, the first thing I did was cut some grass, but while mowing the lawn, I ignored my quest marker and headed south towards a desert area, where I found cracked walls to bomb and shrubs to remove. I found a challenge tomb which gave me a health increase along the way, too. Eventually, I stumbled into a cave, which acted like a miniature dungeon.</p>
<p>There are combat rooms to clear and a few puzzle-platforming sections which forced me to consider the dungeon's layout; dropping down certain sand dunes took me to lower floors, but certain areas were only accessible by dropping down certain holes. The last dungeon of the demo does something similar with lily pads and switches. All standard stuff, but made more fun thanks to your fairy companion.</p>

<p>No, Faie isn't Navi; she might speak a little too much, but Faie is a necessary part of Elliot's adventure because she comes with the ability to fight enemies, gather items. She spends most of the time following you around, but you can also move her by using the right stick. Alternatively, you can command her to fly ahead, stop, disappear, or come back to you. Or, if you want a little Secret of Mana magic, a friend can join you for some couch co-op and take control of her.</p>
<p>Faie's best assets come from her skills, however. One of these is a dash that allows you to run at an extremely fast speed for a limited time, crucial for getting around fast or for traversing crumbling floors. The other is a warp which is extremely useful for getting across larger gaps. It makes dungeon exploration genuinely interesting, going beyond just walking through caves and corridors and fighting enemies.</p>
<p>It's a similar story with combat, which has a few little touches to make Elliot's adventure feel a bit unique. The basics are familiar — you have standard and charged attacks, but variety comes in from weapons and upgrades you can equip and acquire. Along with a sword and shield, you start with some bombs and a bow (see the Link here?), though my noodling around the map and an optional boss led me to a brand new weapon: a chain and sickle.</p>

<p>The chain and sickle rules and was immediately more powerful than my sword. A tap of the 'X' button and the sickle would swing around me in a wide radius. Hold it down, and it spins around Elliot a short distance, effectively acting as a shield. Charge the sickle up, and you can pull enemies towards you. It's so satisfying to pull off. Except when you manage to pull a big enemy with a club towards you just as it's about to bonk you on the head.</p>
<p>There's actually a lot of risk-reward stuff going on here, which made the otherwise simple combat that little bit more engaging. Before I even left the opening town, I bought an accessory that increased my movement speed slightly, but also meant I took some extra damage from enemies. Couple that with diving into the thick of it with the sickle, and it meant I had to be a little more cautious on how I took out big groups of enemies.</p>
<p>Magicite, equippable gems that provide stat increases and weapon buffs, also come with various help-and-hinder effects. One piece of sword magicite increased my base attack power, but at the cost of slowing down my shield recovery time. Another allowed arrows to pierce through enemies, but reduced the damage they did. It meant I had to weigh up my equipment options more carefully and — like badges in Paper Mario — I also had a set amount I could equip.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a blocker in video games, which probably explains my rusty fighting-game skills, but in The Adventures of Elliot, blocking is pretty important. There's no dodge, which took me a minute to adjust to, but a perfectly-timed block stuns an enemy and gives you a few free hits. For an action RPG, it pays to be patient and think things through, especially in the boss fights, which are effectively like little puzzles. Just like many, many Zelda bosses, there are semi-obvious weak points that you have to exploit with all your tools and then strike away to win. The two I fought weren't challenging, but they did make me smile.</p>
<p>There are a few things that Square Enix and Claytechworks need to iron out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">but that's what this demo is for</a>; the frame rate is a little inconsistent, out in the open world, things are a little blurry, and the quick menu isn't exactly zippy. But, as an appetizer for things to come, it's the perfect start to whet my appetite. Even with a new Octopath announcement during the Direct, The Adventures of Elliot was the standout reveal for me, and playing it has only cemented it as one of my most-anticipated games for Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's not that often that a perfectly good and functional air hockey video game drops. In fact, considering that the grotty arcade staple translates so readily to the sphere, very few air hockey games release in general. One of life's persisting mysteries, right there.</p>
<p>However, fear not Switch 2-owning air hockey fans (which I'm sure is a large demographic), as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a> is now here, it costs a fiver and, to borrow an old proverb, 'it does exactly what it says on the tin.' This re-release/remaster of 2010's Japan-only DSI title from ITL is the epitome of laser-focused game design. There is one thing to do here, and it's play air hockey. Go *insert air hockey team name*!</p>
<p>This lovely little Switch 2 version allows players to compete with a mixture of human/CPU opponents in matches that can be either singles or doubles. Simples. Now, the real juice is that you can also choose to play in a variety of ways, because Switch 2 gonna switch, too.</p>
<p>You've got normal TV play from side-on and top-to-bottom viewpoints, and you get to use mouse controls to direct your paddle. You can also choose to use a controller in regular ways if it suits you better. However, the real clincher, and the reason why this one deserves your money, is that you can play with your Switch 2 lying flat on a surface to replicate an arcade table, then sit across from each other and dig into 1v1/2v2 air hockey with zero distractions.</p>
<p>There are no other modes to mess with, no collectibles, or towers to climb, there's not even any emotional banter between a Godfather and his broken son. None of that. Get rid of it. Handy Hockey gives you air hockey. Full stop and/or period.</p>
<p>If anything didn't work well, the whole thing would collapse on its airy arse in short order and we'd have to go back to playing the grabby machine in the corner for knock-off Kirby plushies. But — and remember this game costs less than a (nice) sandwich — the controls with all the motion tech and mouse stuff are really well done. It just works. It's responsive, you can give the puck a gentle nudge or power blast. And when people (me) get over hitting things as hard as they can, well, it's quite strategic.</p>
<p>I've been playing four-player with my wife and kids, all using Mouse Mode, and it's the sort of thing (because of the lack of other modes or online) that's got a tabletop game purity to it. No distractions, just family fun time. My kids also played it later alone, so that's worth a mention, as it rarely happens.</p>
<p>It's advertised as a 120fps experience, and performance-wise — as you'd expect for such a simple game — everything is good. And it looks fine, too: clear, concise, and easy to parse. On the negative side, it would have been nice to have a bit of character added via avatars and persistent profiles for players to keep a history of their play. A few different tables would really help things from growing stale, too.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey]]></content:encoded>
