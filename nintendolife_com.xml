<figure><a title="NSO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/559e224a51925/nso.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo of Canada <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uh-oh-nintendos-seemingly-raising-a-whole-bunch-of-prices-in-canada">recently announced</a> that it would be raising the price of pretty much all of its products and services excluding the Switch 2, with more concrete details to follow on <strong>1st August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The thing is, eagle-eyed fans have already discovered what the new pricing structure for Nintendo Switch Online will be, since specifics have already been divulged via the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/26lcooper/">26lcooper</a> over on Reddit, the new prices are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Product</th>
<th>Previous Price (CAD)</th>
<th>New Price (CAD)</th>
</tr><tr><td colspan="100%"></td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Individual Membership - 1 month</td>
<td>$4.99</td>
<td><strong>$5.99</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individual Membership - 3 months</td>
<td>$9.99</td>
<td><strong>$11.99</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individual Membership - 12 months</td>
<td>$24.99</td>
<td><strong>$29.99</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Family Membership - 12 months</td>
<td>$44.99</td>
<td><strong>$49.99</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NSO + Expansion Pack (Individual - 12 months)</td>
<td>$63.99</td>
<td><strong>$69.99</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NSO + Expansion Pack (Family - 12 months)</td>
<td>$99.99</td>
<td><strong>$109.99</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a reminder, Nintendo of Canada is also changing the price of the Switch, Switch Lite, Switch OLED, digital and physical games, accessories, and amiibo. Given that the cost of NSO memberships has gone up, we can probably expect something similar with the rest of Nintendo's product portfolio.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to update you on further price changes in Canada come 1st August 2025.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Battledock 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5310e3cf3252/switch-2-battledock-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new Switch 2 dock accessory may soon become a reality if the upcoming <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/battledock-for-switch-2">Kickstarter</a> campaign proves to be a success. From Retro Fighters, the <strong>BattleDock</strong> essentially turns your Switch 2 into a functional GameCube (well, <em>sort of</em>) with the inclusion of four ports for wired GameCube controllers.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a replacement for your official dock, but rather an extension. So, according to the details on the Kickstarter page, your official dock simply slides into the BattleDock (dock-ception!) and is then connected via USB-C.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The priority here is low-latency compatibility with GameCube controllers for competitive play, with the pads fully supported with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>Included with the BattleDock are four magnetic covers to give it some personality. As standard, you get Spice Orange, Indigo, Jet Black, and Platinum Silver (though the Spice Orange variant is way more yellow than it is orange, in our opinion), but a stretch goal at $100K will also include Smoke Black, White, and Comet Red.</p>
<p>The campaign will be fully funded at $10K, and each BattleDock costs <strong>$36</strong> for backers (MSRP is set at $39.99). You can sign up now to be notified of its launch if you're interested in giving it your support.</p>


<p><em>Let us know with a comment what you think of the BattleDock so far. Do you think you'll give it a shot?</em></p></section>

<p>DK...Donkey Kong!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're now just weeks out from the smashing arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2 and Nintendo has now released a overview trailer.</p>
<p>It uploaded plenty of these in the leadup to key releases during the Switch generation and this trend continues with eight minutes of footage for the new Switch 2 exclusive. It highlights DK and Pauline's abilities, transformations, boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind this overview is only available on Nintendo's Japanese YouTube channel at the moment but if we get an English version, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we also shared our final preview of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, and despite some minor technical concerns, his latest adventure is showing all the signs of becoming his greatest outing to date. The game's developer has been confirmed as well.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco ended its latest showcase with another look at <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/digimon_story_time_stranger">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a></strong>. If you were wondering about the possibility of a Nintendo release, there's reportedly been a new development.</p>
<p>As highlighted by multiple sources, a new listing has popped up on the EAN database in Europe which includes a code for an apparent "Switch 2 version". These codes are used by retailers to identify products at sale.</p>

<p>Nothing has been officially announced, so it's probably best to treat this one as a rumour for now. In saying this, Bandai Namco has already got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> coming to the Switch 2, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise.</p>
<p>The Switch generation also saw multiple Digimon games released physically and digitally. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is currently confirmed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam, and will launch on these platforms in October.</p>
