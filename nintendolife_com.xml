It's hot. It's 'close', as they say round here. And when you're already hot and bothered, sometimes turning on your Switch 2 console in portable mode for a quick session, well, it's not gonna make you any cooler, let's put it like that.</p>
<p>And so, we've been delighted to see one gamer over on Reddit coming up with a very silly tip for hot days spent playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or whatever else it is you've got on the go (this writer is all over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> right now, FWIW).</p>
<p>Yes, as posted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1lxi84m/found_another_use_for_the_top_usbc_port/">u/Gamingjojo909</a> — who we're assuming is some sort of colossal genius — the top USB-C slot on the Switch 2 console can seemingly power a mini fan while you play (just probably not very safely). Huzzah!</p>

<p>Of course, as fun as this looks — and we're sure it's quite effective for beating the heat momentarily — it will also likely toast your battery pretty quickly and could, as noted a little further down in the comments, maybe even fry your Switch because of...science.</p>
<p>So don't do it. Just look at someone else doing it instead.</p>

<p>Right. Well, we're off to try plugging our favourite toothbrush into our consoles now. How dangerous could it be, right?</p>
