<p>Winter roadmap reveals all</p>

<figure data-uuid="0bb127315c942"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Claws of Awaji" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb127315c942/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrived as an <em>almost</em> complete package on Switch 2 at the end of last year. The only content missing from this portable version was the Claws of Awaji expansion — which had landed on other systems back in September — for which Ubisoft provided a vague 'coming later in 2026' release window. Well, the big Ubi has today been a bit more specific.</p>
<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/5DtVYhhrhh2Oe2JXEjxpSU/ac-shadows-parkour-challenge-and-tu-118-get-ready-for-manual-jumps">Shadows Winter Roadmap</a>, the expansion will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>10th March</strong>. This paid DLC includes a whole new area to explore and storyline to follow, as Naoe and Yasuke head to the island of Awaji to track down a lost treasure. There are also new weapons and skins to unlock in the DLC, all of which can be carried back over to the main game to use as you please.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0eiwvpgk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Before this expansion comes our way, however, Ubisoft has another title update for Shadows, which it'll be dropping tomorrow (17th February). The ver. 1.1.8 update includes new detailed stat pages, a fresh visual feedback for critical hits, and marks the addition of a manual jump option in parkour.</p>
<figure data-uuid="829da49edcd79"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Winter 2026 Roadmap" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829da49edcd79/assassins-creed-shadows-winter-2026-roadmap.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only other thing on the roadmap as it stands is the game's one-year anniversary celebration, which Ubisoft has said will kick off on 20th March with livestreams and giveaways.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Shadows when it arrived on Switch 2 last year, calling it "a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our 8/10 review</a>. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> weren't quite as hot on the Claws of Awaji expansion following its PS5 release, claiming that "it never really elevates itself beyond the base game" in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji">their 6/10 review</a>. We'll have to wait and see what we make of it on Switch 2 next month!</p>

<figure data-uuid="a5d0fca22c7d9"><a title="Horses!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5d0fca22c7d9/horses.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kate Gray</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the back page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em> <em>Today, Kate celebrates the approaching Chinese New Year with a look at the finest equines in video games...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It's almost the Year of the Horse, y'all! The Chinese Zodiac calendar has rolled around once more to this majestic four-legged muscle-beast, after 12 years of horseless behaviour. In fact, the last time it was The Year of the Horse, it was <em>also</em> the tail-end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature_looking_back_on_the_year_of_luigi">The Year of Luigi</a>. Remember that? Remember how beautiful life was in 2014? Life can be beautiful again, with the help of horse.</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering what makes me qualified to write about horses, when I am neither a horse nor a horse expert. But I've written lists of the Best Cows in Games before, and horses are actually a lot like cows in many ways, if you really think about it (four legs, lives on farm, could very easily kill you). Also, if that's not enough, I've enlisted the help of Actual Horse Expert, <strong>Alice Ruppert</strong>, who runs <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/">The Mane Quest</a>, the internet's premier Horse Game Website, to agree with my horse opinions.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:161473,117581,183995/kates-ever-growing-list-of-animal-related-back-pages @ 1771268461 -->
<p>So, now that you know that I am 100% very knowledgeable about horses, here are the <strong>Best Horses on the Nintendo Switch</strong>, in no particular order, because I don't want to upset the horses and have them kick me in the skull.</p>
<h2><del>Kate's</del> Nintendo Life's Official List Of Best Horses</h2>
<h3>Epona</h3>
<figure data-uuid="ec89a9de90d18"><a title="Zelda honse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec89a9de90d18/zelda-honse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>She waited seven years for us! What a good horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate, Amateur Enjoyer Of Horses:</strong> We'll start off basic with everyone's favourite video game horse: Epona. Link's steady companion from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a> onwards, this chestnut mare was raised by Malon and is iconic enough to earn her own song <em>and</em> appear on the title screen.</p>
<p>Yes, in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can obtain some very cool horses — the Giant Horse and the Royal White Stallion — but it's always Epona that has our heart. She's a good, good horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice Ruppert, Horse Expert:</strong> My special shoutout goes to <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/9/17/horses-in-games-companions-and-collectibles">Twilight Princess’ Epona</a>, where she even gets her own rescue subplot, and unlocking her as a mount is made infinitely more satisfying by virtue of having to fight to get her back. Acquiring in-game mounts through story missions like that is so underrated, and I want more of it!</p>
<h3>Roach</h3>
<figure data-uuid="99c5cdb252316"><a title="Roach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99c5cdb252316/roach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Now kiss — <em><span></span> Image: CD Projekt Red / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Geralt's faithful steed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, Roach, is actually a <em>bunch</em> of horses, because it turns out that Geralt goes through horses like he goes through girlfriends. But he always has a Roach, and that Roach always patiently listens to him as he talks about stuff, as detailed in this quote from Blood and Wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Many a witcher has talked over the nuts and bolts of his current contract with his horse while staring at the stars shining above the lonely road, though few would ever admit to this."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the same journal entry also lightly ribs Roach for her tendency to act in an un-horse-like manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In truth, though, he was very attached to her and would never trade her for any other horse. Not even one which, when summoned, would never stand helpless in front of a seemingly easily surmountable obstacle, such as a low fence or stray piece of timber. Nor even one which would sometimes, in some incomprehensible fashion, wind up dancing on some peasant's roof. 'Well,' Geralt would say with a shrug. 'A witcher's horse isn't a normal animal. Constant contact with magic beverages and Signs must have left a mark.'"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geralt doesn't really have a lot of friends, but Roach is definitely one of them. Isn't that just lovely?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Roach is love, Roach is life. Though, I gotta say: massive missed opportunity in The Witcher 3 that they didn’t just recolour Roach while Geralt is on Skellige without any further comment on it! Like, we see in the cutscenes that Geralt arrives by shipwreck, no way he brought a horse along! It would have been so funny for Roach to just be a visibly different horse while he’s on the island, and to switch back whenever you fast-travel back to the mainland.</p>
<p>I am SO excited to see what CDPR ends up doing with Kelpie in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">The Witcher 4</a>… Because that <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2025/6/4/welcome-kelpie-an-unreal-tech-showcase-gives-us-a-first-look-at-ciris-horse-in-the-witcher-4">tech demo they showed</a> was immensely promising, not just in terms of animation and anatomy, but also in treating the horse like a <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2026/1/9/living-creatures-vs-meat-motorcycles-how-to-make-horses-in-games-feel-alive">character, rather than a vehicle</a>!</p>
<h3>Skyrim Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="a2bbfc5b70212"><a title="Skyrim horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2bbfc5b70212/skyrim-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Iconic.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Yes, you can walk across <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>. Yes, you can hire horsecarts to fast-travel you to places. But there's a reason that navigating sheer cliffs via horse is referred to as 'Skyrimming' your way up a mountain (at least, in my household).</p>
<p>Horses in Skyrim allow you to cheese your way up previously insurmountable obstacles, with their powerful and probably magic legs that can apparently handle the craggiest of terrain with no problems. We can learn a lesson or two from Skyrim's horses. Mostly about rock climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I have to say, for all the silly rock climbing antics people make fun of when it comes to Skyrim horses, the models themselves actually manage to look quite good even when being vertically plastered to cliffs! Say what you will about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F5b39bjcgfyzd1.jpeg">t</a>he above image, but that still looks a lot better to me than many alternatives, where the inverse kinematics lead to horribly broken-looking bent forelegs!</p>

<h3>The Horse From A Wonderful Life</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f979f6bf4e207"><a title="AWL horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f979f6bf4e207/awl-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This is Not How Horses Work — <em><span></span> Image: Marvelous / XSEED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: So far, many of our best horses have had some specific boon — friendship, mountain climbing, cool songs — but the horse from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is just a Very Nice Horse. The Harvest Moon games are beloved for their extremely likeable cows, which means that this lovely horse gets overlooked.</p>
<p>But look at it! Such a gloriously long face! Even for a horse! Regard its little hooves! Witness its voluminous tail! And it comes in <em>three colours!</em> This horse is a nice horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> This one loses points for its beady eyes, weirdly placed foreleg joints, and flesh-colored ears, even if it <em>does</em> have a nicely voluminous tail.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="221d6b8e17d3c"><a title="Spectrier but big" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/221d6b8e17d3c/spectrier-but-big.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My steed is too big — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Forgive me for grouping all these fine fillies and stellar stallions together, but we'd be here all day if I did them all separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon</a> has a lot of good horses, you see.</p>
<p>There's the dual legendaries, <strong>Spectrier</strong> and <strong>Glastrier</strong> – the former, a gloriously goth horse that would have been my absolute favourite as an emo tween, and the latter a stately ice-horse with the ability Chilling Neigh, which is immediately cool as heck.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Ponyta</strong> and <strong>Rapidash</strong>, the beloved horses from the OG 150, with their adorable candy floss Galarian forms, and their (very appropriate for the Year of the Fire Horse) flaming manes.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Mudsdale</strong>, the shire-horse-like lad who evolves, somehow, from a donkey, with big, beefy legs that can carry you across the plains of Alola <em>or</em> stomp your opponents into submission.</p>
<p>Then there's <strong>Keldeo</strong>, the mythical Colt Pokémon, with the alternate form of "what if really big horn", which functions as a sword. Very neat! Very dangerous! I'm glad real-life horses don't have face-knives!</p>
<figure data-uuid="21ce64a074f46"><a title="Arceus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21ce64a074f46/arceus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Horse-god. Or god-horse. Either way, definitely a horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, we've got <strong>Arceus</strong> — the literal god of the Pokémon world — who is less obviously 'horse' than the others, thanks to its pointy feet and deer-like grace, but we're calling it a horse.</p>
<p>With two legendary horses, one mythical horse, and an actual god horse, we have the suspicion that there's someone on the Game Freak team who really, <em>really</em> likes horses. And who can blame them?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love Mudsdale for being rare draft horse representation, but Ponyta and Rapidash are the <em>clear</em> winners of ‘best horse Pokémon’, if you ask me. You know how people sometimes complain that all Pokémon designs are getting rounder and don’t have sharp lines anymore? That applies to almost all cartoon horses, too, but actually having some sharp lines and edges are what makes cartoon horses more horse-y! Ponyta and Rapidash had some <em>edge</em>, and that’s wonderful. Also, they’re literally on fire. What else can you ask for?</p>
<h3>The Stardew Horse</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2faf14a46c69a"><a title="hathorse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2faf14a46c69a/hathorse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wooooaaaaahhhh that horse is so COOL — <em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/ak8whr/i_found_out_that_horses_can_in_fact_wear_hats/">ConcernedApe / deleted Reddit user</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: This horse can wear hats. It's an expensive investment, but well worth it. Because it can WEAR HATS.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but I will never not be salty that of all animals in the game, this is the only one you cannot build a relationship with, and you cannot do <em>anything</em> that would count as ‘taking care of it’. No filling a water bowl, like you can for your dog or cat, no feeding or giving treats, no hearts to fill up, no stable upgrades. The Punished Backlog said it best: <a href="https://punishedbacklog.com/the-horse-in-stardew-valley-deserves-better/">The Horse in Stardew Valley Deserves Better</a>.</p>

<p>We took a look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marios-joined-by-some-familiar-foes-in-new-galaxy-movie-poster">foe-filled Mario one</a> last week, but an additional six posters have since been released, each showing a different character in a unique locale. These have been shared across the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supermariomovie/">Galaxy Movie social accounts</a> and as a daily upload on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a>, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather them all together for you check out in one place.</p>
<p>Below, we've done just that! You'll find each of the seven posters in the order they were revealed, accompanied by a write-up of some smaller details you might have missed. Let's-a go!</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters</h2>
<h3 id="mario">Mario</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2033ad3ec6889"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2033ad3ec6889/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure."</p>
<p>You might have already spotted this one in our coverage from last week, but it's too good not to mention again. Aside from Mario pulling his iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Galaxy</a> 'spin' pose, we'll also give a shoutout to the range of enemies on display here. <em>Sledge Bro</em>? That's a deeper cut than we expected.</p>
<h3 id="luigi">Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cf1ecf62abd60"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf1ecf62abd60/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Conquering his fears, no bones about it."</p>
<p>Luigi's spotlight is expectedly fear-filled, <em>but</em> we do get a closer look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Tostarena setting that we first saw in the film's initial reveal trailer and its skeletal inhabitants. It looks... well, like Tostarena.</p>
<h3 id="bowser">Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="39ee7a3fa8d61"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39ee7a3fa8d61/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"He's got an ax (or two) to grind."</p>
<p>Aside from looking really rather threatening with those two axes held aloft, Bowser's poster crams a lot into the background. The big wheel and Bullet Bill merry-go-round have a whiff of World Bowser from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and what's with that giant UFO in the sky? Huh, looks like the King of the Koopas will be getting big again after all.</p>
<h3 id="peach-andamp-toad">Peach &amp; Toad</h3>
<figure data-uuid="40287951410dc"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40287951410dc/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Always looking out for the little guy."</p>
<p>Wow, there are <em>a lot</em> of cameos in this one. The penguins make a return from the first movie, but we've also got the Galaxy Star Bunnies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s Pianta, a Conkdor, and even some Whittles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. And what's with all of those rockets blasting off to a nearby galaxy? Hmm, a lot to digest here.</p>

<p>Yep, we're fans of this Rosalina design. There's a particularly cute Baby Luma on the left, and our first proper look at the Comet Observatory in the background on the right.</p>

<p>"No wonder he's a menace."</p>
<p>A Bowser Jr-shaped planet, battleships, and a magic paintbrush that spits Piranha Plant ink? It's no wonder those Koopas down the bottom look scared.</p>

<p>The realistic T. rex model and waterfall-covered planet in the background have us wondering whether the Cascade Kingdom is joining Tostarena as another Odyssey cameo. It seems likely, no?</p>

<figure data-uuid="c2c025ed95807"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2c025ed95807/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rising demand for RAM for AI data centres and the associated rising costs are having a massive effect across the tech world, and with Sony reportedly pushing back the launch of its as-yet-unannounced PS5 successor, Nintendo is considering raising the price of Switch 2 in 2026, too, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">a new Bloomberg report</a> (paywall).</p>
<p>Speaking to "people familiar with its plans", Bloomberg reports that Sony is now eyeing 2028/29 for its next console hardware, and that Nintendo is looking at how to approach what the article says is being coined "RAMmageddon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">Niko Partners predicted</a> that Nintendo would be forced to follow suit and raise hardware prices as its competitors have.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the possibility of a price increase in an interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">back in January</a>, but refused to be drawn on plans at the time, saying "I cannot comment on hypotheticals".</p>
<p>With most tech firms reliant on memory and microchips produced by other companies, this precarious situation around RAM manufacturing has been a concern for some time now, with the crisis growing as AI-invested firms such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchase DRAM for data centres to drive chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Prices have been driven up at an alarming rate as demand outstrips component availability, with Bloomberg stating that the "cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January" alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, tech firms must choose between slimmer profit margins or raising prices in an already-fraught economic environment. The Switch 2's launch pricing and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price tag <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">proved controversial</a> with gamers in June last year, and Nintendo raised the price of all its Switch 1 hardware in the US <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">last summer</a>. Sony and Microsoft both <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-series-xs-how-their-prices-have-changed-over-the-past-five-years">raised their hardware prices recently</a>, with PlayStation getting a $50 hike on all PS5 models in the US <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/ps5-price-increases-confirmed-for-usa-effective-21st-august">last August</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have gotten its latest console to market ahead of full-scale "RAMmageddon", but it still has to keep the ball rolling and keep up production numbers. With the tech sector's reliance on RAM for almost everything and the AI bubble yet to burst, one thing is for certain: Switch 2 certainly isn't getting <em>cheaper</em> anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Are you tempted to push the boat out for a Switch 2 before it gets even more expensive? Happy you jumped in early? Let us know below.</em></p>

The nine winners will then go head-to-head in a final poll at the end of the month.</p>
<p>We're covering a generation a day until we've ticked off all nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days</strong>.</p>
<p>It's Day Three, meaning it's time to pick your favourite Hoenn Pokémon from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_pinball_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a>). And if you missed Gens 1 and 2, those polls are still live:</p>

<p>As before, let's tap some NL Poké Trainers for some non-obvious picks they're considering...</p>



<p>Let's forge ahead, then. As before, the 135 contenders here are listed in National Dex order, but use the search bar to quickly find a particular Pokémon. And remember, <strong>you can only choose one!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Keep an eye out for further generations in the coming days as we cruise towards Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</em></p>
