<p>Move comes due to "market conditions"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch OLED" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c39d84c0d7ce/switch-oled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced it will change the price for a whole bunch of its products in Canada, citing "market conditions" for the move.</p>
<p>This comes via <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">Newswire</a>, with more information on specific prices coming directly from Nintendo of Canada on <strong>1st August 2025</strong>. The official announcement specifically mentions "price changes", but let's face it, we all know they're probably going up, not down.</p>
<p>Here's a list of products expected to be affected from the price changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch - OLED Model</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Lite</li>
<li>Digital and Physical Games</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Accessories</li>
<li>amiibo</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Online Memberships</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the good news (if you can call it that) is that the Switch 2 seemingly won't be affected by the move – at least for now. Nintendo specifically states that "This pricing change does not apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 system, accessories, or software", so that's good to know.</p>
<p>Nintendo had previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-is-delaying-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">delayed its intended pre-order launch date for the Switch 2 in Canada</a>, stating that it wanted to align its plans with North America, which had also seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-the-us-amidst-new-trump-tariffs">a delay of its own as a direct result of uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the region</a>.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is seemingly not going anywhere after President Donald Trump recently stated he would be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg629n7wzvo">"terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada"</a>. Trade talks are, however, set to resume after Canada ditched its digital services tax on tech companies.</p>

<figure><a title="Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0e093ec3bac6/elden-ring-tarnished-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all may still be waiting for an official release date, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> has finally secured a Switch 2 rating from the ESRB.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe" tabindex="-1">@necrolipe</a>, the game's official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">ESRB listing</a> has been updated with an M ( Mature 17+) rating, noting that it contains "Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, and Violence," <em>and</em> "in-game purchases".</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the ESRB website, which goes into the specifics behind the rating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a character trying to retrieve a magical ring and become the Elden Lord. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, collect items, and battle various enemies (e.g., knights, fantastical creatures) in melee combat. Players use swords, spears, axes, arrows, and magic to enemies; combat is highlighted by cries of pain, splatters of blood, and impact sounds. The game includes depictions of gore: collectible items that include severed fingers and tongues; a boss character cutting off its arm; severed arms hanging from a ceiling. During the course of the game, a humanoid monster is depicted partially nude, with scales/scars covering its breast and pelvic regions. The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is hardly all that surprising when we consider that the original Elden Ring, its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and Nightreign all received an identical 'M' from the ratings board, but hey, it might imply that things are progressing behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The upcoming Switch 2 release wasn't specifically mentioned in the recently revealed line-up for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/bandai-namcos-summer-showcase-promises-plenty-of-switch-news-later-this-week">Bandai Namco's Summer Showcase</a>, but there's every chance that it <em>might</em> make an appearance, with a release date attached. For now, we can only dream.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/gallery-unboxing-superdeluxes-lush-switch-editions-for-radiant-silvergun-clock-tower-and-wizardry">Having already seen how excellent the company's other physical editions can be</a>, I couldn't wait to see what <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sometimes-the-only-way-to-preserve-a-game-is-to-own-it-japanese-publisher-superdeluxe-gets-physical">Superdeluxe</a> had in store for this one, as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/the-best-castlevania-games-of-all-time">Castlevania</a> is without a doubt my favourite game series.</p>
<p>Despite the firm's connection with fellow physical publisher <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/limited-run-talks-switch-2-game-key-cards-huge-carts-and-difficult-pitches">Limited Run Games</a>, this edition is different from the one that was released (and then quickly sold out) on LRG's site.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wiyvug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This amazing collection includes a physical copy of the game (complete with a full-colour instruction manual in both Japanese and English), a trading card, a selection of art cards, a four-disc soundtrack, and a bonus "Castlevania: The Secret History of the Crescent Moon" book.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the game is intended for the Japanese market, it plays in your system's selected language on Switch and Switch 2. <em>Phew!</em></p>

<p>This particular edition costs ¥8,980 / $62 / £45, but you'll naturally have to cover the cost of shipping from Japan.</p>
<p>"Even with the questionable inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_ii_simons_quest">Simon's Quest</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/castlevania_the_adventure">Castlevania: The Adventure</a>, the 'highs' on offer are among the highest points in the entire franchise, and a Western debut for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_dracula">Kid Dracula</a> is a lovely treat for retro gamers looking for something new," <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">is what we said in our 8/10 review of Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>. "As long as you’re willing to ignore the lesser titles in this package and you're not too bummed out by the omission of other classic entries, then you’re going to have a very good time with what’s left."</p>
