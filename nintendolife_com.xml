<p>This week has seen the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on Nintendo Switch 2, which the wonderfully handsome and beautiful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Alex had a look at</a>, the award-winning (and thoroughly excellent) <u><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a></u> finally dropped on Switch, and the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trials Beyond The Horizon</a> stuck the landing with epic RPG action on both Switch 1 and 2. Hooray!</p>
<p>In the news, it's been rather quiet overall, never a bad thing, but we <em>have</em> had some tasty nuggets in leaked looks at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zeldas-next-lego-set-might-have-been-leaked-heres-a-first-look">new Zelda lego set</a> (I'll take 10, thank you, and no I don't have any money), Sophia Turner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sophie-turner-looks-incredible-as-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-series">making an awesome-looking Lara Croft</a> (please put more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider</a> games on Switch 2, lads, come on now) and, of course, lest I forget - I could never - we've had the arrival of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/site-news-please-welcome-mai-the-newest-member-of-our-youtube-team">brand new member of the Nintendo Life YouTube team</a>. So if you haven't said hai to Mai yet, now's as good a chance as any.</p>
<p>Right. Enough messing. Let's take a look at what the team's game-playing plans are for this weekend!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll be doing a whole lot of racing around on Switch 2 for my next review, but I'll also definitely be making plenty of time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which I'm finally serious about playing through, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, which is turning out to be a belter so far. It's no wonder we gave it a 9!</p>
<p>That's it for me, I think, all that gaming goodness and some sausages for tea. Have a relaxing one!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm really hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> at the moment. Honestly, if I'd actually got my bum in gear and started playing this earlier, it might have wound up on my top five games of 2025. It's wonderful. The world just feels so alive, and I love sneaking around the different syndicate hideouts and stealing a bunch of goodies.</p>
<p>I'm eager to dive back into a <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda</a></strong> game at the moment, too, but which one is unclear at the moment. Maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> via NSO? Or perhaps I should give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> another shot. I'm sure I'll have an answer for you next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This week has been pretty spectacular for me, what with joining the Nintendo Life team and the Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update releasing! Let’s just say I’ve spent every spare moment collecting over 1.5k of hotel tickets, tidying up my island and upgrading my house storage to accommodate my “collecting” habits.</p>
<p>Other than that, I’ve also been exploring some of the demos on the eShop, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. I have a soft spot for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares</a> games, so checking out the latest entry was pure adrenaline-pumping joy. I can’t wait to try it out when it finally releases. Is it weird to say that I can’t wait to get creeped out?</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is quite amazing I am this many years old and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_4">Halo 4</a>’s campaign remained an unspoiled experience. I am having quite a blast in the boots of Spartan 117 and should wrap up the game this weekend, which also wraps up all the single-player campaigns from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. I am now even more depressed with the cancellation of the TV show.</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time in virtual 16th-century Japan because I keep wandering into high-level zones and missions in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. I need to get more serious about this whole main plot revenge thing else I risk not having enough free storage space next week to trade Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures for Cloud and the Avalanche crew in Midgar.</p>
<p>On a more 'cosy game' affair, I have picked up the delisted 2014 remake of Cinemaware’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wings">Wings!</a>. Absolutely loved the original Amiga outing and was quite happy with both the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance versions, but had never played the <strong>Wings! Remastered Edition</strong> version, and I hope to shoot down von Richthofen before the sun rises on Monday.</p>
<p>Game of the week is the weekly Arcade Archive! Being quite the fan of the original back on both ZX Spectrum, NES, and Game Boy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-bomb-jack-twin">Bomb Jack Twin</a> was the entry in the series that I would expect to show up on Super Nintendo or Mega Drive, but alas it was not meant to be, so this supercharged 16-bit sequel eluded us all.</p>
<p>Now, it shines forever on our modern console tablet thing.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I've got some chums coming over this weekend, so I know what I'm going to be playing: <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>.</p>
<p>How does that sit with your preconceived notion of a weekend's entertainment, eh? Bet you couldn't imagine someone as hip and happening as me rolling dice and being nice to various peasants, could you? Well, it's happening, baby, and I'll probably bash out some Animal Crossing: New Horizons as well.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing has gotten its claws in me once more. Between stripping Kapp'n's tour islands of their natural resources and using said resources to craft crap to get access to more crap like a good little capitalist, I acquired a couple of genuine artworks from Redd by chance. Now I'm spying the only wing of my museum that isn't complete and wondering if this update is the excuse I need to 100% my collection.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I want to make time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a> now that it's out in Europe. Short and sweet, I've heard - looking forward to a kickaround. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend is Plane Time (again) and I'm about 1% through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, so getting through that is probably my job for the foreseeable future. And I don't mind at all! It's wonderful! Although the bit I'm at is a little hands-off. There was a lot more to do in the [REDACTED] but now it's a lot more visual novel-y. Maybe that'll change! Who knows! I have no idea where this game is going any more, and I love it.</p>
<p>Also, probably a fair bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Ball x Pit</a>, and another game I can't talk about because I'm playtesting it, shhhh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> hits the Switch 2 next month and if you weren't already excited about the game, to top it off, there are a bunch of retro Sega titles you'll be able to revisit.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sega-is-adding-playable-bandai-namco-game-gear-titles-to-yakuza-kiwami-3">recent Game Gear news</a>, another arcade title has been revealed. As noted by our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/woah-yet-another-sega-arcade-oddity-confirmed-for-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">pals at PushSquare</a>, it's the "delightfully oddball" Model 3 release, <strong><a href="https://segaretro.org/Magical_Truck_Adventure">Magical Truck Adventure</a>.</strong> It will be joined by <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">Emergency Call Ambulance</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/arcade-beat-em-up-slashout-joins-emergency-call-ambulance-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">SlashOut</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This title originally debuted in 1998 and is a solo and co-op "on-the-rails" action experience where you control two kids named Roy and Alma who must power a hand-operated rail cart to retrieve a "magical stone". You'll also be required to dodge and jump things along the way, as you pump the lever up and down to accelerate through a variety of wild and wacky courses.</p>

<p>You can see the other retro games revealed for Yakuza 3 Kiwami so far <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sega-is-adding-playable-bandai-namco-game-gear-titles-to-yakuza-kiwami-3">in our story from earlier this week</a>.

<p>Ignited by a viral Metacritic campaign</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c0e42cf26f5db"><a title="Cory in the House" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0e42cf26f5db/cory-in-the-house.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Disney</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this week, the 2008 Nintendo DS title Disney title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/disneys_cory_in_the_house">Cory in the House</a> was reportedly on the cusp of dethroning the award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> on Metacritic's user ranking list.</p>
<p>Although Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/all-time/userscore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=1">remains out in front at the time of writing</a> with a user score of 9.6, as a result of this viral campaign to get Cory's game into the top spot, it's now reportedly led to the title's price spiking in value on eBay. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awful-nintendo-ds-game-disney-cory-in-the-house-now-selling-for-hundreds-of-dollars-on-ebay-amid-viral-metacritic-campaign">highlighted by IGN</a>, the game is now being sold for "hundreds of dollars".</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11foizshl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This includes sealed listings which have sold for up to $399 USD. It's quite a contrast to last year around November, when copies of the title were supposedly selling for under $10.</p>

<p>So, if you happen to have a copy of this DS shovelware on a shelf or packed away in a cupboard or box somewhere and it's in decent or pristine condition, now might be the time to offload it.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released, IGN (one of the few outlets to apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/cory-in-the-house-review">upload a professional review</a> when the title launched) said it was "awful" - awarding it a score of three out of ten, and noting how the short-lived experience had "some of the clunkiest controls", "insultingly stupid" presentation and minigames that were "hardly games at all".</p>
