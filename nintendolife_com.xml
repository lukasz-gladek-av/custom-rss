<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fcd6f6dd4267/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Resident Evil</strong> series has seen pretty strong representation on the Switch, but it's perhaps safe to say that fans aren't best pleased with some titles being relegated to 'Cloud Versions'.</p>
<p>We're still waiting to see whether Capcom is keen to re-release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">RE3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">RE7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">RE Village</a> natively on the Switch 2, but for now, it seems the company is <em>potentially</em> considering bringing its latest entry to Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is due for release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and, according to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who has been known to leak RE news prior to official announcements, the game is supposedly being planned for release on both the Switch 2 and the PS4.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xwpohy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what they had to say via <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963021049014190354">X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine.</p>
<p>"I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing.</p>
<p>"Unsure if it'll be at launch, and my guess is it'll be a different version with different tech, sorta' like the 360 / PS3 &amp; Wii / PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms.</p>
<p>But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it's happening."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as mentioned, if Requiem were to come to the Switch 2, then it may not release day-and-date with the scheduled launch in February. As for the visuals and performance, well... that seems somewhat obvious, right? Still, if this is true, then it's not <em>entirely</em> surprising. <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Capcom's president recently</a> stated that the initial response to the Switch 2 caught the company off-guard, so it seems reasonable to assume that it'll want to take advantage of the exceptionally strong sales.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will star Grace Ashcroft, daughter of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft, who is instructed to investigate a series of strange deaths at the sinister Wrenwood Hotel. The game will also pay a visit to the ruined wasteland of Raccoon City, and it's heavily rumoured that RE veteran Leon Kennedy will play a role, possibly as a second playable protagonist.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil franchise will also be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, with Capcom recently launching a <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html">dedicated website</a> to commemorate the milestone.</p>
