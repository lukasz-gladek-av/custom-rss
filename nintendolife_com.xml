<p>Rebirth and third entry are now in development for Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9b2fa0ecbe9f7"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b2fa0ecbe9f7/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, then you'll probably already know that its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, along with the untitled third entry, will also head to the hybrid console in the future.</p>
<p>Rebirth represents quite a drastic departure from Remake, introducing a vast open world that serves as an almost direct contrast to the tightly-designed environments found in the first entry. This will no doubt sow doubts in fans' minds about just how well it might hold up on the Switch 2. After all, Rebirth's visuals were already noted to have suffered from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2rHUbqauUk">a few downgrades</a> at launch when compared to Remake.</p>
<p>From a gameplay perspective, however, fans can expect parity across all systems with Rebirth and the upcoming third entry. In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html">speaking with Nintendo of Europe</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi states that the gameplay experience is "exactly the same", explaining that any differences might be "confusing for players".</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's not a huge amount of information I can share in terms of future games, but I can reassure players that we’re working on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second game in the series, and the third game too. They are being worked on for Nintendo Switch 2 alongside the other platforms right now.</p>
<p>"One thing to reassure the fans who want to play these games on Nintendo Switch 2: I've got a personal policy where I don't want to make any versions of my games different or offer a different gameplay experience just because they're on different hardware. That might get confusing for players, and they might wonder which version of the game they should buy. That’s something I’d very much like to avoid. The Nintendo Switch 2 versions are being developed in a way that keeps the gameplay experience pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms, so I hope this reassures Nintendo Switch 2 players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Remake hits the Switch 2 <strong>*checks notes*</strong> <em>today</em>, it seems likely that we won't see Rebirth for a little while yet, never mind the mysterious third entry. We'll be keeping a close eye on any and all developments, however, and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do check <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our full review</a> for Final Fantasy VII Remake if you haven't already. We awarded it a score of 9/10, stating that it "makes impressively few compromises" in moving over to the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="344fee7dbef72"><a title="Croc: Legend of the Gobbos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/344fee7dbef72/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Argonaut Software</em></figcaption></figure><p>Poor old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a>. The Argonaut Games remaster arrived on Switch on <strong>2nd April</strong>, the very same day that we were all distracted by the monster Switch 2 reveal Direct, and those who pre-ordered the physical edition way back in Oct 2024 <em>still</em> have no idea when it's going to arrive. Talk about a Croc-y start.</p>
<p>The game itself was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/croc-remaster-will-miss-its-december-2024-launch-window">delayed</a> back in late 2024. After launch, Rock It Games, the company behind the physical, said that <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/croc-update">tariff issues</a> had "made it temporarily difficult to schedule shipments for some items," but things were supposedly back on track. Then, following the release of the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/crocs-switch-remaster-returns-this-week-with-a-free-platinum-edition-update">'Platinum Edition' update</a> last October, the company pushed things again to get the whole game complete on cartridge — "the unavoidable consequence of this upgrade meant delays in the mastering, approval process and physical manufacture of the disc and cartridge with Sony and Nintendo respectively."</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rqlizn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, where does that leave things now? In a <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/coc-legend-of-the-gobbos-january-2026-update">new blog post</a>, Rock It says that "the delays have been unacceptable," and that going forward, it will be committed to "only offering games once development is complete and our delivery timelines are fully under our control." But there's still no firm release date.</p>
<p>According to the post, the game disc and cartridges have now been approved for production by Sony and Nintendo, Platinum Edition update included, and much of the extra merch found in the beefy Collector's Editions is either complete or arriving in the warehouse by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The thing is, the production updates aren't consistent between posts — one month, items are complete and ready to go, the next, they're not. Mix-ups happen, of course, but those who dropped $129.99 on the Collector's Edition over a year ago are, rightly, after something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>"I have zero trust in Rock It Games because of this," one user wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/">r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/comments/1qfs5w9/argonaut_acknowledges_delays/">Reddit</a>, "If they would have just told the truth, and admitted things got screwed up, and didn't go to plan, I would have been disappointed, but understood." Others have been so frustrated with the process that they have already requested refunds.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that the regular and Collector’s Editions of Croc are coming soon," developer Argonaut Games said in an update post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTmH2B5FmHd/">Instagram</a>, "We’re as eager to receive them as all of our customers are!"</p>
<p>When exactly "soon" is remains to be seen, but hey, maybe 2026 will be the year!</p>

<figure data-uuid="b035a2e387f0b"><a title="Pokémon / Universal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b035a2e387f0b/pokemon-universal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon Company and Universal Studios <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000798.000005761.html">have announced</a> that a 'world class' Pokémon attraction will be coming to Universal Studios themes parks in Japan and global locations.</p>
<p>Described as an 'interactive Pokémon experience' that will "stimulate all five senses", the attraction will debut at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka before being rolled out globally. This presumably includes parks in Orlando and Los Angeles in the US along with Singapore and Beijing.</p>
<p>Tsunekazu Ishihara, President and CEO of The Pokémon Company, had the following to say:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fowpiuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Since announcing our medium- to long-term alliance in 2021, we have collaborated with Universal Studios Japan's outstanding creative vision and world-class technical capabilities to produce a variety of 'real-life Pokémon experiences,' including the NO LIMIT! Parade and Halloween show.</p>
<p>"This year marks the 30th anniversary of Pokémon, and we are extremely pleased to be able to fully launch this new project with you all at this major milestone. Our mission is to enrich both the real and virtual worlds through the existence of Pokémon, and we produce Pokémon every day. With this project, too, we hope to create new entertainment that is unique to theme parks, as a rich experience in the real world, and continue to provide surprises to people all over the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no time scale as to when the attraction will launch, but those in Japan can at least look forward to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokepark-kanto-the-new-pokemon-theme-park-opens-its-doors-in-february">opening of Poké Park Kanto</a> at Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll keep an eye out any further developments regarding the new Pokémon attraction at Universal Studios. If nothing else, we're expecting to see lots and lots (and <em>lots</em>) of new merch.</p>
