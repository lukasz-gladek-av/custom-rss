            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> deservedly received praise for its occult-themed gameplay, with many deeming it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">worthy spiritual successor</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/devils_crush">Devil’s Crush</a>. Now, sole developer WIZNWAR is back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a>, a cyberpunk-inspired twist that improves upon its predecessor in almost every conceivable way. Simply put, this is one of the greatest pinball games ever made.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> managed to pull in players who have never even entertained the idea of playing poker, then Xenotilt has the power to do the same for pinball – it’s remarkably approachable while being <em>incredibly</em> difficult to put down once it's got a hold of you. In combining straightforward mechanics with a near-constant stream of points topping up your high score, you’ll find the desire to have “just one more go” almost impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Set on a single ‘table’ (which is themed to look like a spaceship of sorts), the aim is simple: score as many points as you can with your three allocated balls. Split between three distinct tiers, the table houses a selection of boss characters that you’ll need to vanquish to gain huge chunks of points.</p>
<p>You achieve this by battering them with your ball via carefully aimed shots from the flippers, or by firing from auto-turrets. You activate these (providing you have ammo) by ‘cradling’ the ball on one of the flippers and pressing ‘down’. The turrets immediately lock onto enemies both big and small, and it’s a great way to clear the field and give yourself some more room.</p>
<p>Like other pinball games, you can also nudge the table to coax the ball into moving in specific directions, either to hit an enemy, grab a jackpot, or prevent yourself from falling into oblivion. Nudging too often within a short period of time can lead to a game over, so use this sparingly!</p>
<p>There's <em>endless</em> opportunities to ramp up your score, and if you’re able to maintain your combo multiplier, you’ll soon find that you’re able to break through the million-point barrier, perhaps even the billion. This is perfectly doable on ‘Normal Mode’, but if you opt for ‘EX Mode’, you can occasionally enter bonus areas completely separate from the main table. These offer up massive rewards, and one is even a quaint little spin on the game of snooker – it’s great fun.</p>
<p>It also looks the part too, with pixel art sprites, neon colours, and gloriously outrageous effects combining to create a stunning symphony of light and sound. It can sometimes be difficult to keep track of things in the default view, but Xenotilt also supports TATE mode, which looks awesome whether you’re playing on the OLED Model or the Switch 2. Similarly, the music is inspired, and I guarantee that at least one of the tracks will get stuck in your head long after you step away from the table.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played a pinball game before, then Xenotilt might well be the only one you’ll ever need. Heck, even if you don't <em>like</em> pinball, I suspect playing this might very well change your mind – it's mercilessly addictive from the get-go. Give it a shot and you’ll soon succumb to its will.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action]]></content:encoded>

<p>Square Enix has released a new side-by-side comparison video for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>. Not only do we get a look at the game's opening cutscene on the Switch 2 in docked mode, but alongside this is a direct comparison to the same moment on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix previously confirmed Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while offering "smooth performance" and some "crisp visuals".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187149 @ 1760806449 -->
<p>Other details about the Switch 2 version haven't been revealed just yet, but the first impressions of this version have been relatively positive so far. The game's director has also recently gone into detail about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">how the team made this version look so "great"</a> while praising Nintendo's new device as a "truly amazing piece of hardware".</p>

<p>Square Enix mentioned last month how it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">intends to release a demo for the Switch 2 version</a> of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade by the end of this year, so if you're still unsure about it, this might help ahead of the full game's arrival on 22nd January 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7d1cb8ea3e6c1"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d1cb8ea3e6c1/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The NES — specifically the Nintendo Entertainment System, <em>not</em> the Famicom — turns 40 today.</p>
<p>The console's staggered rollout across the US makes its launch a bittier affair than the orchestrated, worldwide drops we're used to these days. But four decades ago, the first units were purchased in the United States and Western gamers began playing with power.</p>
<p>Europe saw similarly piecemeal launches in the years that followed. Mario became a household name there, too, although the NES wasn't the same, all-conquering hit across the pond, where SEGA had a stronger foothold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="1cjcr-XtVQw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f68bszipgw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Still, with such a strong library from Nintendo itself, plus third-party powerhouses like Capcom and Konami delivering brilliant games while British dev Rare established itself as a premier Nintendo partner, the grey-brick-box carved out mindshare all the same. You couldn't play Mario on a Mega Drive, could you?</p>

<p>For decades, the NES has had a monopoly on the retro video gaming space in a popular sense, thanks to a mix of undeniable quality, the console's sales success, and sheer nostalgia that comes with a system so many people enjoyed as a kid. But is the latter is falling off a tad? Is this platform's outsized mindshare being chipped away by Father Time?</p>
<p>Years pass, new gamers are born and raised, and there's now a generation of video-game-loving parents for whom the Nintendo Entertainment System <em>wasn't</em> a formative console. When their kids go digging through wardrobes, they won't find a dusty NES and a box of frayed cardboard boxes buried in the back. Asking about this titanic 40-year-old system may well elicit quizzical looks these days, even from Nintendo fans. Do you have any NES carts in your collection? How many of you reading were even born in 1985?</p>

<p>Naturally, over a long enough time scale, familiarity and enthusiasm fall off. Not <em>respect -</em> there's still plenty of that. You're being deliberately obtuse to deny the transformative effect of the console and its library. But actual, card-carrying fans with firsthand affection for the NES? It feels like they're on the decline - at least if the genial shrugs of the people I've asked in the run-up to the 40th anniversary are anything to go by!</p>
<p>With the wealth of video games available and the enormous history of the medium to digest, no wonder people's passions are shifting as the medium ages. Anyone gatekeeping or dismissing younger players who — <em>tsk</em> — haven't done their homework and played OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Wonder</a>, or for whom the DS is 'their' first Nintendo, needs a talking to.</p>
<p>The NES is also possibly the most discussed and dissected console in video game history. Every five years since the turn of the millennium, we've seen retrospective blowouts and generational deep-dives across every strata of games media. <em>Haven't we been there and done all that on the 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, and 35th anniversaries!?</em></p>
<p>Well, perhaps. But as we move forward, there's always worth in reviewing where we've been - and it's never been easier to sample the 8-bit bottle. This vintage is drinking now, so pour on, garçon!</p>
<figure data-uuid="f1a55772114d0"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1a55772114d0/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking around at the official options to play NES games in 2025, there's always room for improvement, but Nintendo is doing a fair job of surfacing its 8-bit library with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-nes-game-ranked">79-game-strong selection</a> of first- and third-party titles on Nintendo Switch Online, ranging from classics to curios to <em>Somebody picked up a cheap licence, hmm?</em> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/urban_champion">Urban Champion</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us, though, the possibility of access being unceremoniously revoked — which has happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_soccer">one Super NES game</a> at the time of writing — makes us wary of relying on access through subscription services like NSO.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are innumerable ways to play NES games 40 years on. Perhaps you're rocking an NES Classic Mini conveniently sitting under the telly. Maybe you've taken the MiSTer route or grabbed an Analogue NT or another FPGA system - or maybe a rough-and-ready clone console. Hell, you can play these games in a browser these days. (I'd say they deserve better than <em>that</em>, but of course I would.)</p>
<p>Or do you — <em>shocker</em> — still play on your original console? Have you gone down the retro rabbit hole and invested the price of a PS5 Pro in an incredible upscaling setup?</p>
<p>Or do you just <em>not</em> play NES games these days?</p>

<p>No judgement here! We're just interested to get a temperature check on how you tend to enjoy Nintendo's 8-bit output in 2025. Let us know in the poll below, and join Team NL in wishing Nintendo's little (read: actually quite large) grey box the happiest of birthdays. Why not go retro this weekend, hmm?</p>
<p><em>*goes and turns on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>*</em></p>
<p>Close enough. Look, GOTY's coming, you know!? Tick tock.</p>

<p>It's the weekend, so it's time to recap some of the biggest stories from this week before we dive into some good ol' gaming.</p>
<p>First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> went live, and while we certainly enjoyed our time with it, the game just doesn't quite match up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>. We've also published our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-walkthrough">ongoing guide</a> for the game, so if you're finding yourself in a bit of a bind, then definitely check it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/hollow-knight-silksong-receives-another-update-here-are-the-patch-notes">a new update</a>, while Takashi Iizuka explained why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/takashi-iizuka-explains-why-sonic-racing-crossworlds-was-delayed-on-switch-2">delayed on the Switch 2</a>.

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm playing with lots of balls this weekend. That is to say, I'll be booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a>.</p>
<p>Both games are relentlessly addictive, and I'm hesitant to say which I prefer, but I'd probably lean a little closer to Xenotilt at the moment. It's just <em>so</em> damn good. My review will be live at some point today (Saturday), so be sure to check that out if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Oh no, much to my surprise, I am having a good time playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this with a new mainline entry, so I’m going to ride the wave for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Will I be tired of it by Monday? Maybe, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take for as long as I get to see my beloved Totodile waddle around next to me.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly - Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I’m really hoping to spend a lot more personal gaming time than usual on the Switch 2 as I’ve gone mad and bought a bunch of new games for it. My haul includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, both of which I’ve yet to start, but am very, very excited about!</p>
<p>I’ve also added BALL x PIT to the mix, and Ollie has gone and got me well up for trying some Xenotilt, so that’s most likely gonna get snapped up too, before I forget about it due to just how many games are starting to pile in now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> should be getting a shot too, but what hope do I have keeping up with all this lot? We’re gonna need more hours added to days soon.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm helping to judge a games award this month, which means playing lots of games that came out this year (and some that aren't out yet!) I can't talk about most of them, but it did give me a chance to finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, and I had actually forgotten how clever the first game was.</p>
<p>The puzzles are really well-designed, with very thoughtful logic, and there are tons of neat features in Antiquities that make it even easier and more pleasurable to play. I had no idea what I was doing for the first few minutes (there isn't much of a tutorial, and I think it suffers for it) but exploring the small shop ends up being its own reward, anyway. It's really good!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm basically only playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A right now, all for you lovely lot. I wish I enjoyed it as much as others seem to, but alas, I might just have to accept that Pokémon isn't for me anymore. Keep an eye out for some more helpful tips from yours truly, of course.</p>
<p>I have my eyes on Ball X Pit and Absolum, though — as soon as I have the time... Have a good weekend!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Since I haven’t really been a part of the Pocket Monster madness from the beginning, I will be entertained in a galaxy far, far away. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is still delivering a ton of fun when searching off the main road. Super happy to finally have Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action on Switch because I can’t rotate my giant TV to play this in tate mode so portable mode it is (make sure you check the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> if you missed it). Still dabbing at Hades II and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 36 of 50 games played. More amazing stuff from this endless package, with the arena rogue light run’n’gun Overbold, the sequel to Campanella and the belt action Fist Hell being particular highlights.</p>
<p>Game of the week is BALL x PIT. I was already sold on the entire thing thanks to a recent STEAM fest demo but now, both on TV and on the go this is one seriously addictive game! Yee be warned!</p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I recently picked up Xenotilt, the endlessly replayable new pinball game with sharp cyberpunk aesthetics from the makers of the acclaimed Demon's Tilt. And it's a feast for the senses, to say the least. It's approachable, integrating fresh ideas like activating gun turrets and bullet hell mechanics with your ball, but deceptively technical—especially if you want to see all the table has to offer. I'll be playing a lot of that this weekend.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've just grabbed BALL x PIT, published by Devolver Digital. I haven't jumped in yet, but I've been extremely intrigued by this title ever since I saw the trailer for it. It's been described as a mix of Vampire Survivors and Breakout, with influences from other puzzle games and roguelikes, and I'm just a hundred percent on board with this. It really looks like nothing else, and the reviews have been very encouraging—so I wouldn't object to getting totally sucked in.</p>
