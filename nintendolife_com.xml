<p>As ever, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY">Day of the Devs</a> was on hand to highlight a bunch of upcoming indies that we can look forward to in the next year or two. It was a slightly slimmer showing on the Switch front than we have seen in previous years (at least, as far as <em>confirmed</em> Switch releases go), but there were still two titles that have already announced a Switch (2) launch.</p>
<p>First up, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a>, a '90s "rock-and-roll management RPG", that sees you put in charge of a grunge rock band comprised of anthropomorphised wilderbeast... and a fish. It sounds like a lot, and it looks like it, too. The gameplay has a bit of everything — rhythm games, management sims, visual novels — and the whole thing has a visual style that looks like it's just stumbled out of a <strong>Bojack Horseman</strong> episode.</p>
<p>In short, we're <em>very</em> interested to find out more. Rockbeasts doesn't have a firm release date at the time of writing, but the devs <em>did</em> confirm that it will be launching on Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Rock on, dude!</p>

<p>The second Switch game showcased in the latest Day of the Devs was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demon_tides">Demon Tides</a>. You might remember this one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-every-announcement-confirmed-switch-games#demon-tides-2025-switch-unconfirmed">last year's DotD event</a>, and yes, it still looks awesome. This is the next 3D platformer from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a> dev Fabraz, combining super slick-looking movement with the most toe-tapping of hip-hop scores.</p>
<p>Once again, there's no Switch release date for this one just yet, though Fabraz has confirmed that Fangamer will be handling a <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1998833988883107978">physical release</a>, so that's something to look forward to!</p>

<p>Naturally, there's every chance that we will see a fair few of the other games from the latest Day of the Devs showcase pop up on Switch at some point down the line. Switch 2 is still very much the new kid in town, so we'd be surprised if indie devs don't want to capitalise on its relative hotness and bring their titles over.</p>
<p>We've added the full Day of the Devs: The Game Awards 2025 Edition showcase below, so you can take a look at all the games revealed and make your own predictions about whether they will be heading to Switch or not.</p>

<p>Shipping Spring 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've had mixed opinions on the CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch, but now the company has come out swinging with a brand new iteration – and it's compatible with both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nitro Deck 2</strong> starts shipping in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> and looks to be a significant upgrade over the previous model. It seems the company has the Switch 2 in mind with this new product, but those still on the original Switch can still get in on the action. You'll just need to utilise the additional centrepiece to make up for the height difference, while turning the dial on the back to decrease the length of the chassis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Deck 2 has offset analogue sticks which, for the first time, aren't situation directly above and below the d-pad and face buttons. They utilise capacitor-based technology are said to be free from potential drifting issues. It also features additional back buttons, adjustable deadzones, turbo mode, and more.</p>
<p>The d-pad design and stick tops can also be swapped out, but be mindful that these additional parts are sold separately.</p>

<p>Pricing is confirmed at <strong>£89.99</strong> for the Nitro Deck 2 itself, while any addition d-pad/stick packs are <strong>£19.99</strong> each. Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">CRKD website</a>.</p>
