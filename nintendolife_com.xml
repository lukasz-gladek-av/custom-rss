<figure><a title="Reshiram and Zekrom Black &amp; White" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/796e4fe77916b/reshiram-and-zekrom-black-and-white.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Pokémon</strong>'s fifth generation kicked off 15 years ago today with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Pokémon Black &amp; White</a> in Japan.</p>
<p>On 18th September 2010, the world first stepped foot into Unova, a brand new Pokémon region based on North America, specifically New York City's metropolitan area, with a mix of landmarks inspired by the area <em>and</em> other part of the whole country.</p>
<p>Pokémon Black &amp; White changed the rulebook of the Pokédex for the first time. Introducing a mammoth 156 new Pocket Monsters, the largest amount ever in the series, trainers were forced to adapt and use <em>only</em> those new 'mons. Want to whip out a Zubat in battle? Well tough; here's a Woobat for you, though.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Mh1U8qC_TUE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mh1U8qC_TUE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mh1U8qC_TUE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mh1U8qC_TUE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e70bmhtzsk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh1U8qC_TUE" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>At the time, Black &amp; White weren't particularly well loved — you couldn't use previous Gen Pokémon unless you could trade with a friend who'd beaten the game and unlocked the National Dex <em>or</em> beaten the game yourself. Pokémon such as Trubbish and Vanillite were criticised for being based on objects or food (as a note, this write <em>loves</em> the Vanillite line; it's so stupid). Complaints about stagnant gameplay were abundant. And many features in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver</a> remakes were absent here.</p>
<figure><a title="Unova" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/102bf804e826b/unova.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet time has been extremely kind to Generation 5, and today, many consider it one of the best in the franchise. N, the puppet head of the villainous Team Plasma, has become a fan-favourite character, and 'mons such as Chandelure, Zoroark, Krookodile, and Volcarona among the most-beloved.</p>
<p>And, if nothing else, the duo spawned direct sequels that eschewed the usual third-game formula: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white_2">Pokémon Black 2 &amp; White 2</a>. No Pokémon Grey for you folks.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, there's been much talk of a potential Black &amp; White remake coming to the Switch — or, more likely the Switch 2 at this point. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl</a> were the most-recent, so if we're going in chronological order, then it absolutely makes sense.</p>

<p>Plus, The Pokémon Company hasn't been shy about teasing and sharing Black &amp; White related media; events focused on the Unova-era 'mons have popped up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> and the <strong>Trading Card Game</strong>. Fans thought they spotted a tease in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, and a character from Black &amp; White turned up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>.</p>
<p>So, on Gen 5's 15th anniversary, is now the time for a Pokémon Black &amp; White remake? We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legends: Z-A</a>, focusing on Gen 6's Kalos, around the corner, and 2026 delivering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Champions</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>. But what about Unova?</p>

<p>Update: Promises to be " their biggest yet!"</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-09-18T18:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 18th Sep 2025, 7:30pm</time>]:</strong> Get ready for some snappy, child-like adventures in early 2026, as Lil Gator Game's big expansion, In the Dark, arrives next year on Switch.</p>
<p>The release window was just announced as part of today's Six One Indie Showcase, and we got an adorable new trailer to go with the DLC.</p>
<p>Promising the double the size of the original game and bring a little spookiness to Lil Gator's life, you'll be exploring an underground world of cavernous corridors and secret treasure. Oh, and plenty of new friends too. Just have a little peek at these new screenshots:</p>

<p>Lil Gator will get more tools to expand his adorably impressive moveset, too; did you know a gymnastic ribbon can help you double jump? Well, we didn't until now.</p>
<p>This looks like the perfect way to start 2026, so we'll keep an eye out for a release date. And for more details on the expansion, have a look at our story from the start of the year below...</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Playtonic Friends and MegaWobble have announced a surprise expansion to one of the cutest hidden gems of 2022, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lil_gator_game">Lil Gator Game</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In The Dark</strong> promises to be a "huge" expansion, introducing new characters and doubling the size of the base game. The original was a breezy affair, but we're delighted to have the opportunity to revisit all of our animal friends. You'll be exploring a whole new area tucked under the surface after a new cave opens up. New toys and gadgets will allow you to explore in many different ways.</p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll be getting more news on it later in the year. And, alongside In The Dark, a new bundle titled <strong>Gator of the Year Edition</strong> will be released, allowing newcomers to grab the base game and the expansion together.</p>

<p>There's no better time to get into Lil Gator Game than this year — and if you want something short, sweet, and meaningful, then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lil-gator-game">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>
