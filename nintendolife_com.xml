<p>"Most of our inspiration comes from the comic books"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are mere weeks away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> punching its way onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December</strong>, and with the full character roster now out in the open, the team at Tribute Games has shared a breakdown of what we can expect from each fighter.</p>
<p>In the above video, the team explains how it assembled a lineup of both familiar and lesser-known faces, and how each character keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>We're sure that many people will be coming to this game only with knowledge of Marvel's big-screen appearances, though the team confesses that it has mainly taken inspiration from the comic books. This means that big players like Nova, Phyla-Vell, and Beta Ray Bill might not immediately stand out as the best-known of the bunch, though Tribute Games writer Yannick Belzil says this is completely intentional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good superhero lineup has very recognisable faces, but lesser-known characters as well, because it makes you lean forward. Like, "Who is she? Who is he? Who's that person?" You want to discover new characters, and we wanted to introduce new characters to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of iconic figures in the game as well, and the video does a good job of also spotlighting the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Black Panther and Wolverine.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait until next month before we can pick our favourite fighters, but, as with every glimpse at gameplay footage that we get, we like what we're seeing.</p>

<figure data-uuid="03be4022f096c"><a title="Terminator 2D: No Fate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03be4022f096c/terminator-2d-no-fate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Reef Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reef Entertainment has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed again on all consoles, with the game now scheduled to launch on <strong>12th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The company states that all components for the physical editions have now arrived (which is what prompted the first delay, if you remember), but that it will take some time to get everything assembled. It's determined to release both digital and physical versions at the same time, hence the delay.</p>

<p>It's not a very long wait, which is nice, and maybe this will prove to be the perfect game to experience after the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> on 4th December.</p>
<p>Developed by Bitmap Bureau, Terminator 2D: No Fate sees you take part in key scenes from the iconic action movie, <strong>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</strong>. After completion of the game, you'll be able to replay it while making key decisions to change major events.</p>
