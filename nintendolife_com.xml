<figure data-uuid="04693f01a55cc"><a title="Ash Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04693f01a55cc/ash-pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been dealt a bit of a legal blow in Japan as the Patent Office has rejected an application relevant to the company's ongoing case against Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>
<p>This patent is related to monster catching à la <strong>Pokémon</strong>, but it's not quite the same one filed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">US reported on back in September 2025</a>. This one appears to be linked to the act of throwing and aiming objects to either capture a creature or initiate a battle.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">GameFray</a> reports that the patent in question (which is pending application no. 2024-031879, so not <em>specifically</em> one of the Palworld applications, but related) has been rejected as the application lacks an inventive step, determined after looking at "prior art", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ark_ultimate_survivor_edition">ARK</a> mentioned as a specific example.</p>
<p>The Notice of Reasons for Refusal, dated 22nd October 2025, states (via machine translation) that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field."</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b2b3ab4a171a"><a title="Palworld Catching" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b2b3ab4a171a/palworld-catching.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What catching Pals used to look like in Palworld — <em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Evidence submitted against the application includes a video from ARK of <a href="https://youtu.be/Kj0VKPqSByA?si=p1u8CF_Dlw8jnutT&amp;t=143">a character throwing a pod-like item</a> at the ground, and at other creatures, and aiming with a blue crosshair, and a list of tools from the survival game that can be used in-game, including an arrow that can be used to stun another creature.</p>
<p>Other games mentioned for comparison are manuals, tutorials, and Wikis for <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/craftopia">Craftopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/monster_hunter_4">Monster Hunter 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, and the free web browser game <strong>KanColle</strong> (also known as Kantai Collection).</p>
<p>While the rejection is non-final — meaning Nintendo can resubmit their application with modifcations — it also shares a parent with <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en">JP7493117</a> (which focuses on character movement, collision, interaction, and throwing creatures at one another to initiate battle) and is the parent of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en">JP7545191</a> (which is the aiming to catch or battle in a virtual space) both of which <strong>are</strong> crucial to the main Palworld case.</p>
<p>As GameFray notes, if one member of a patent family is faced with issues, it can often highlight other problems with the rest of the group. Plus, judges often respect the decisions made by patent examiners. So we'll have to see what Nintendo's response is.</p>

<p>With the wider Palworld case, proceedings are still ongoing. Nintendo first filed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-and-pokemon-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-developer-pocketpair">a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair in September 2024</a> which "seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights."</p>
<p>Since the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/palworld-developer-pocketpair-changes-pokemon-like-summoning-mechanic">Palworld has changed its Pal catching and summoning mechanic</a>, which Pocketpair has gone on to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pocketpair-recalls-depressing-day-nintendo-announced-its-palworld-lawsuit">speak about</a> with disappointment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/palworld-dev-announces-disappointing-game-changes-resulting-from-nintendos-lawsuit">a number of times</a>. But the developer is still considering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/forget-the-lawsuit-pocketpair-says-palworld-on-switch-2-is-100percent-worth-considering">bringing the game to Switch 2</a>.</p>

But amongst all the Bells and whistles announced, you might have missed the news that retro Nintendo games are also returning to the series. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Yes, you will once again be able to play 8-bit and higher-bit classics in Animal Crossing, just like you could in the original game back on GameCube! However, there are some caveats.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5oqsuvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">According to the announcement</a>, there'll be a new resort hotel added on the pier in the 3.0 update where you can help out and, by increasing its "island brand recognition", a souvenir shop will start stocking new items. On one of the tabs labelled 'Special', you'll find a host of retro Nintendo hardware, including the Ultra Hand, the Love Tester, and a bunch of lovely Nintendo consoles. <em>Yaaaaas.</em></p>
<p>Buying these with the new currency lets you set them up in your room as you'd expect. However, if you've got an active NSO subscription, you can play "a select classic game on each system." <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/clu_clu_land">Clu Clu Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/dr_mario">Dr. Mario</a> (for the Game Boy) are shown in the clip.</p>

<p>The consoles shown include a Switch 2, Famicom, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Boy, and Super Famicom, so it looks like we're going up to at least 16-bit this time!</p>
<p>For those who weren't there, the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> had a selection of NES games, including titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/excitebike">Excitebike</a>, that you could obtain and actually play <em>in</em> the game long, long before Virtual Console turned up and having retro titles on your current Nintendo system was a matter of course.</p>
<p>So, the retro games are back in AC! But only one per system, and probably not the classics you were hoping for.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no reason to be glum because all the games are playable in a more straightforward way via NSO itself. Still, we kind of hope Nintendo might decide to let you play <em>all</em> the games in the NSO library through this Animal Crossing wrapper. Pointless? Sure. But delightful? Absolutely.</p>
<figure data-uuid="67abf0000c4e3"><a title="Animal Crossing New Horizons Retro Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67abf0000c4e3/animal-crossing-new-horizons-retro-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>That arcade cab looks pretty great, too, although we doubt 'Space Blaster' will be playable. C'mon, Nintendo, put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/radar_scope">Radar Scope</a> on it! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, a bunch of cool collabs with other Nintendo games will see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-collabs-with-lego-splatoon-and-zelda"><strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Splatoon</strong> items crop up in New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p><em>Do you think they'll get N64, the upcoming Virtual Boy, or GameCube in there too? Is there a scenario (stick with me here) where we could be playing the original GC Animal Crossing NES games in the original GC Animal Crossing in <strong>this</strong> Animal Crossing?</em></p>
<p><em>Woah. Let us know which game you think they'll make accessible for the other systems below.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has just revealed that it's getting an absolutely huge update on <strong>15th January 2026</strong> alongside a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. It's stuffed full of new features, characters, and an entire hotel. But maybe the biggest update comes in the form of some brand new collaborations.</p>
<p>First up, after several successful sets of Animal Crossing Lego Sets, Lego is <em>actually</em> coming to the game itself. You'll be able to buy a whole suite of Lego-themed furniture and clothes via Nook Shopping, meaning you'll be able to live your brick life fantasy on your island.</p>
<p>You better save those Bells up, then. We're already eyeing up that arcade game as our first purchase. No, we don't <em>need</em> a sofa, this is way more important...</p>
<p>Next, we have a Legend of Zelda collab which will net you some gorgeous themed furniture and clothes if you have compatible Zelda amiibo.</p>

<p>There's lots of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-themed stuff like a Guardian (it's inactive, don't worry) and a Zonai Device, but you can spy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>, the Master Sword, Tri (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>) and wallpaper and flooring themed after the forest where the Master Sword resides.</p>
<p>Similarly, Splatoon amiibo will also unlock some extremely colourful furniture (note: Big Man Sofa) and clothing. It looks like these are buyable via Nook Shopping once you've scanned the amiibo in.</p>
<p>And, two more amiibo bonuses. Scanning in Zelda amiibo will unlock Mineru and Tulin as villagers, while Splatoon amiibo will allow you to get Cece and Viché. And they look <em>adorable.</em></p>

<p>Goodness. That's a <em>lot</em>, and it's not even the bulk of 3.0! There's a whole range of stuff being added to the game next January, with playable retro games consoles making their grand return (kind of!) alongside tons of quality of life updates.</p>
<p>And, don't forget, update 3.0 is <em>free</em>.</p>
