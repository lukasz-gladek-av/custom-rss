<p>As revealed in today's trailer drop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>10th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The story DLC sees you and Team MZ investigating mysterious distortions that have been cropping up across Lumiose City, connected to the strange land of 'Hyperspace Lumiose'.</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the new trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when Team MZ’s efforts seem to have restored peace to Lumiose City, something strange begins to happen—mysterious distortions start forming all around town. You’ll also meet a mysterious young girl named Ansha, who is accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can expect new Mega Evolutions (Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y take pride of place on the key art), plenty of Hoopa content, and more than a little eerily-silent dialogue from you and your MZ pals. Hey, at least the dimension-hopping looks interesting enough.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of those new Mega forms for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, Diancie and Meganium:</p>

<p>As a reminder, the DLC will set you back <strong>£24.99 / $29.99</strong>, and it is now available to buy on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html#DLC">Switch eShop</a>.</p>

<p>I need hands!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well here's a dish that we weren't expecting! Team17 and Ghost Town Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overcooked-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Overcooked 2! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is being served up today!</p>
<p>As initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, this is the same old co-op cooking chaos that we all know and love, garnished with some new features to make the most of the beefed-up system.</p>
<p>We've got 4k 60fps gameplay in docked mode, we've got camera integration so everyone's screaming faces can appear on screen, we've got GameShare for playing with pals on one copy of the game, heck, there's even a new chef: The Pristine Platinum Platypus.</p>
<p>A pretty balanced meal, no? Well, it won't arrive for free. Those with the Switch 1 version of the game will be able to upgrade for <strong>£7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99</strong>, or you can pick up the full Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> on the eShop. There is a 20% discount running on the storefront for one week only, so you can sneak in and grab an early bird offer if you want to plate up soon.</p>

<p>And for all those wondering, yes, there is cross-progression for this release, so all of your precious DLC and save data can be transferred over to the new edition without any troubles — nobody wants to see those three-star runs go to waste.</p>
<p>A spot of Overcooked can be a dangerous game over the holiday season, but with the right chefs in the kitchen, we're ready to head back in for another good old giggle.</p>

<p>As today is launch day, we now know who to thank for such musical bangers, and it's none other than the music group Monaca — the sound team behind the <strong>NieR</strong> series.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment popped up on the <a href="https://monaca.jp/en/works/13333">Monaca website</a> today, crediting Keiichi Okabe, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Oliver Good, Keita Inoue, Taichi Joraku for the composition, and Ryuichi Takada for the arrangement.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2srloij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The production studio was founded by Okabe back in 2004, and has since provided tunes for games and anime alike, even picking up the coveted 'Best Score/Music' award at the Game Awards 2017 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a>.</p>
<p>The team has long served on the NieR series, though you'll also find their works in PS5 titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>, and they even assisted on a handful of songs in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> soundtrack.</p>
<p>This is the first time they've had a Nintendo joint to themselves, mind you, and we are big fans of it. We described the score as "excellent" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">our review</a>, and have been leaping back to the music player on more than one occasion to listen to select tracks in isolation.</p>

<p>We've managed to get our grubby little mitts on Samus &amp; Vi-O-La, and we thought you might like to take a closer look at what this thing looks like. We would've loved to bag ourselves the solo Samus figure too, but unfortunately we're not made of money – amiibo cost a lot these days, in case you didn't notice!</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/DAVE-THE-DIVER-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2957273.html">eShop listing</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition offers "higher resolution and improved frame rates", while the content of the game remains unchanged between the consoles. Dave's diving escapades didn't feel like they <em>needed</em> a boost in this department, but smoother swimming is always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>Those with Dave the Diver on Switch 1 can upgrade to this new version for free. Alternatively, you can pick up the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> (a discount on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> brings that down to $11.99 until 13th November).</p>
<p>Developer Mintrocket teased that the update would be coming "soon" back in June, so it's nice to see that promise finally materialise.</p>
<p>We awarded Dave the Diver an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dave-the-diver">our review</a>, calling it one of the few 2023 games "that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". If you still haven't dived in, now might be a good excuse to do so.</p>
