<p>Get to know a new and mysterious character...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a>'s delay isn't the only news from Level-5 today. To help lift spirits, it's now officially revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> major (<em>and entirely free</em>) DLC. This was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">teased earlier this year in June</a>, and it's now scheduled to arrive this December.</p>
<p>It's called "<strong>The Sinister Broker Bazario's Schemes</strong>" and will introduce players to the new character Bazario, who has an "unsettling grin" and "appears to conceal countless secrets". Additionally, there'll be new monsters to battle, brand-new equipment and mounts, and much more.</p>
<p>Here's a bit about the story and this new character:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story unfolds on Ginormosia, which is undergoing a mysterious transformation...At the heart of the story stands Bazario, a new character whose unsettling grin appears to conceal countless secrets. As a familiar jewel begins to glow, the stage shifts to Ginormosia, now enveloped in a darker and more ominous atmosphere."</p>

<p>Here's a new trailer to make up for it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some breaking news from Level-5, with the company today confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> will no longer arrive on the Switch and Switch 2 this year.</p>
<p>This update comes alongside the latest trailer at the Tokyo Game Show. It's now scheduled to arrive at some point in 2026. Here's the <a href="https://www.layton.jp/jouki/en/topics/250925/">official statement via the Layton website</a>, which notes how the team wants to deliver the title in the "best possible form":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LEVEL5 Inc. would like to begin by offering its sincere apologies to all fans who have been looking forward to the release of Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. Although the release was originally scheduled for 2025, in order to deliver the game in the best possible form, the launch has been rescheduled for 2026. We deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding and continued support."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the trailer above, you'll be able to hear the "brand-new music composed for this adventure" which also gives fans a "first glimpse of the steam-powered town, Steam Bison, and Layton and Luke's classic back-and-forth".</p>
<p>When we hear more about when exactly this new entry will be releasing for Nintendo's platforms, we'll let you know. This new Professor Layton outing was originally revealed by Level-5 in 2023 and was targeting a 2025 launch until this latest delay.</p>
<p>In some other delay news, 2K Games yesterday announced it would push back the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo today announced a remaster of Dynasty Warriors 3 and it will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 next year on 19th March 2026.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</a></strong> contains <strong>Dynasty Warriors 3</strong> and <strong>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends</strong>. It's running on Unreal Engine 5 and the action system of the third title has also been evolved to create an even more exhilarating experience.</p>
<p>Here are some additional details from the official game website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>About “DYNASTY WARRIORS 3” and “DYNASTY WARRIORS 3: Xtreme Legends”</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
