<p>We first noticed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/under_the_island">Under The Island</a> almost two years ago, when its debut trailer brought all kinds of happy memories from the glory days of GBA Zelda flooding back. This weekend, Top Hat Studios and Slime King Games showcased even more of their upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">Minish Cap</a>-like, and announced that it'll arrive on Switch on <strong>17th February</strong>.</p>
<p>As you'll see in the above release date trailer (narrated by none other than our good friend Jon Cartwright, we might add), the GBA charm is strong with this one — that opening dungeon looks more than a little like Deepwood Shrine, no? But that's not to say that it's without interesting mechanics of its own.</p>
<p>The top-down adventure game sees you play as Nia, an intrepid explorer who sets out to save Seashell Island from its sinking fate. It's got the usual block sliding and button pressing puzzles that we'd expect to see from a Zelda-like, but we're also particularly interested in the 'Treat Bag' item that we spotted in the above trailer, which lets you befriend or otherwise utilise wild animals' abilities to solve problems. Come on, who doesn't like a smiling pixel art dog?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/UNDER-THE-ISLAND-3017958.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
