<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> speeds onto the Switch 2 this week, and it just might be the best-looking game to date on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/grid-legends-on-switch-2-an-excellent-racer-stacked-with-graphics-options">Digital Foundry has now taken a look</a>, and here's exactly what you can expect when it comes to the game's performance and resolution across the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The docked graphics mode runs between 1080p and 1440p at 30fps, and docked performance mode is 792p to 1080p and maintains a smooth 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the handheld experience, GRID Legends includes four options on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This includes performance, battery saver, balanced and graphics modes. In graphics the game runs between 792p and 1080p at 30fps, and in performance it's 684p to 828p at 60fps. The battery saver and balanced modes result in lower resolution and frame rates of 30fps and 40fps.</p>
<p>So, what's the best way to play? Here's Digital Foundry's recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the docked experience, we're going to have to give the nod to the 30fps graphics mode simply because so much of the visual experience is stripped back to give you that 60fps alternative that the game loses a lot of its graphical appeal - and we have to wonder why the option for a 40fps balanced mode that traded some resolution for features didn't make its way into the shipping game. For mobile gaming, it's perhaps no surprise that we've opted for that 40fps alternative: resolution is OK, a 25ms per-frame refresh still looks good on the VRR panel and while you don't get volumetric lights, the return of screen-space reflections is worth it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, PJ O'Reilly recommended the "smooth performance" option and was still blown away by how great it looked on the big screen. He was also impressed with the range of graphics options and just how "solid" they were across both the docked and handheld modes.</p>

<p>We weren't expecting this!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo released a major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> this week, and in case you missed it, it adds health bars to the game.</p>
<p>This has come as a real surprise to Splatoon players, as up until now, the enemy's health in multiplayer was displayed through visual cues. As Nintendo notes, the remaining health of opponents will now be shown above their heads for "a few seconds" when they're visible. Certain abilities can also make this bar visible.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description about the implementation of health bars in multiplayer:</p>
<h2>Health bar</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With version 11.0.0, it’s now possible to see an opponent’s remaining health when they’ve been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!</p>
<p>"Now, their remaining health will be shown in a bar above their head for a few seconds, provided they’ve not ducked behind cover or dived into their ink. Though if the opponent is visible via abilities such as Thermal Ink or has been marked by things like a Point Sensor or Wave Breaker you’ll be able to see it even then!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned by Nintendo, it's not always the easiest to see "how damaged an enemy" is in the heat of the battle, so this update will no doubt help, even if it arguably removes some of the uniqueness and charm of the team-based squid-shooter.</p>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how you can now also see the health bars of your teammates when they've taken damage, which may allow you to save them before they're wiped out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they’ve taken damage. Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you’ve teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you’re not familiar with."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these updates, Nintendo has also highlighted some other notable updates, including a new state known as "Flow Aura", updates to the game's hit detection, and stealth jump. You can find out more about all of this in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-ver-11-0-0-update-launches-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">official patch notes</a>.</p>

Of course, this is subject to change before the release, and there could also be updates in the future which change the game's file size.</p>
