<p>Trinket Studios (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a>) and Outersloth revealed their brand new and rather tasty-looking card-battler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a>, a little while back, and it's out right this very moment on the Nintendo Switch Entertainment System.</p>
<p>Now, if you're feeling in any way like this particular writer, you may have just thought, <em>'No, no more card-battling games - I reckon I'm all good for now, folks.'</em> But judging from what we've seen of this one, it may well be worth your time, especially if you're into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona</a>-styled storylines threaded throughout battles that feature things like massive robots and gigantic monsters. Y'know, all the best things.</p>
<p>We've already seen in the past how a good story can bring a card game to life in all-new ways, thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/slay_the_spire">Slay the Spire</a>, and, with the press release describing a "heartfelt hunt for alien superweapons", Battle Suit Aces has certainly got our attention.</p>
<p>Here are some more story details from the folks over at Trinket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on a heartfelt journey through the stars on the USS Zephyr, joining Captain Heathcliff and his ragtag crew as they search the galaxy for fabled Relic Suits. Sojourn through monster-infested galactic wilds, leading your crew through danger, tragedy, and comedic sci-fi shenanigans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently available on the eShop at a launch discount price of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor3WyIV2HocHJ_LHTM8XWAAhu72zeNcxMM0NOkpNARSi5Frg9uO">Â£19.88/$22.49</a> (or whatever that is where you are).</p>
