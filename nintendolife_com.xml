<p>Due for launch "mid next week", one key aspect of the patch is that it will actually nerf the game's difficulty in certain areas – primarily relating to two early boss encounters and a reduction in damage from the 'Sandcarver' enemy.</p>
<p>Prices for certain items will also be decreased, while certain rosary rewards will see a slight bump.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yjmgkz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Y'know, only seven years after its announcement</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Panzer 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4bbe3e89d2d2/panzer-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Forever Entertainment has announced that <strong>Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Remake</strong> will be playable at this year's Tokyo Game Show 2025 event.</p>
<p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2018 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">the remake of the first game</a>. The latter launched in 2020 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">wasn't quite the slam dunk</a> that many hoped it would be, with the sequel then languishing for several years.</p>
<p>It's back, though! And while no release date has been provided at the time of writing, we can at least seek comfort in the fact that, yes, it's real and it's coming. We can't imagine a release will be too far off, as Forever Entertainment has already confirmed that it'll be priced at <strong>$24.99</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yjmgkz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>

<p>Who's the boss of Uranus?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We've spent a whole big chunk of time reviewing and playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> over the past month or so (let this writer tell you) and we thought — we genuinely absolutely thought — we'd seen it all.</p>
<p>However (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/08/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-has-an-insane-secret-boss/">Forbes</a> for the hot tip), it seems one very, very, very...very well hidden boss escaped our metallic clutches on our playthrough. Yep. It's one of those ones where you wonder just how on earth anyone ever actually found it.</p>
<p>Indeed, by travelling eight hours — that's eight human hours in the real-life world, not video game hours, or even dog hours — straight upwards at Uranus (heh) Tower in the game's Forest region, you'll find another great big Arsenal (heh) battle on a platform that is in with a shout as the highest in any video game. Surely?</p>
<p>Now we haven't tried this yet, because it'll take ages, and we can just watch the video at the top of this very article. Honestly, having already beaten the biggest bosses in the main game, and upon hearing there's nothing special in terms of drops for your trouble on this one...well, how about <em>you</em> go fight it and report back? How does that sound?</p>
<p>If you're game, all you need do is head to the forest region, and take the door in the top right area that leads to an elevator for the tower. However, you're gonna have to manually fly up, which is the bit that takes so long. Once you've done the tricky bit (and those fine folk over at Forbes do suggest letting your Switch 2 go into sleep mode so you can have a break), you'll face off against the All-Seeing One.</p>
<p>Sounds like a right nosy arse, so best let them have it, all guns and/or laser swords blazing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Genki advertised its products well before the official reveal</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f8b2a468a1cd/genki-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the start of the year, as the hype around Switch 2 was beginning to reach fever pitch, accessory manufacturer Genki began to prematurely advertise its products for the then-upcoming console. Perhaps most notably, it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/genki-is-hosting-its-own-switch-2-accessories-direct-later-today">broadcasting its own 'Direct'</a> on the same day Nintendo revealed all regarding its new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo, as you can imagine, wasn't best pleased about having its plans revealed early, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">proceeded to file a lawsuit against Genki</a>, claiming that the latter had "demoed and promoted unauthorised purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories". It also claimed Genki violated its trademarks by using names similar to the Switch, e.g. Glitch and Glitch 2.</p>
<p>Now, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">official court documents</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1965259917335343375">OatmealDome</a>), Nintendo and Genki have reached a settlement, with Genki required to pay an undisclosed amount of damages.</p>
<p>A key segment of the document reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant (Genki) represents and attests that it did not obtain access to any of Plaintiff’s (Nintendo) property (e.g., including but not limited to an unreleased Switch 2 or any documents, files, consoles, or accessories relating thereto) prior to the Plaintiff’s First Look Trailer or official launch of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>"The parties have resolved Plaintiff’s claims in this action pursuant to a separate confidential settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) that operates in conjunction with this Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction (“Consent Judgment”)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the agreement, Genki is required to refrain from using any logos or names that might be deemed confusingly similar to that of Nintendo's. It's also prohibited from using the terms 'Glitch', 'Glitch 2', 'Genki Direct', and 'Genki Indirect' when advertising its products, and indeed, if you head to the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/collections/ns2-accessories">company's website</a> right now, you'll see no mention of any of these.</p>
<p>Genki must also refrain from using specific colour schemes in its packaging and marketing that may be deemed too similar to Nintendo's core identity. Essentially, Genki needs to ensure that consumers are fully aware of its status as an unlicensed manufacturer.</p>
<p>Another win for Nintendo then, and let's be honest, who here didn't see this coming?</p>
