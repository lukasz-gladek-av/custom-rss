<p>New gameplay is more than Peppy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Chuhai Labs has shared the first gameplay trailer of its stunning-looking on-rails shooter, <strong>Wild Blue Skies</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Wild Blue</strong>), featuring some anthropomorphic animals piloting flying vehicles through the skies to fight evil. Sound a little familiar?</p>
<p>Okay, so the game still isn't confirmed for Switch (or Switch 2) yet — just PC and Xbox — but just watch the gameplay up top. Trust us. This is <em>basically</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a> with lovely cel-shaded-inspired visuals and all the barrel rolls, shooting and banter you'll ever need.</p>
<p>Here's a run-down if you need a <em>little</em> more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features Ready for Takeoff:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Modern Take on 90s On-Rails Shooters:</strong> Experience the thrill of classic aerial combat reimagined with modern design, smooth controls, and updated visuals.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>From an Aerial Legend:</strong> Developed by Chuhai Labs, the indie studio founded by Giles Goddard, the legendary programmer behind <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Stunt Race FX</em>, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and <em>1080° Snowboarding</em>.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>High-Flying Adventures:</strong> Take control of Bowie Stray and soar through vast environments from scorching deserts to frozen tundras and beyond.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Cinematic On-Rails Combat:</strong> Engage in thrilling dogfights and take down waves of enemies as you navigate intense, cinematic levels.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Environments:</strong> Each mission offers unique hazards and landscapes that challenge your reflexes and reward skillful flying.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Stylish Visuals &amp; Smooth Performance:</strong> A polished, modern aesthetic that channels the spirit of classic 3D shooters with crisp effects and fluid motion.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Streamlined Systems:</strong> Slick controls and intuitive gameplay make it easy to jump in while offering depth for veterans of the genre.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Rewarding Progression:</strong> Rack up high scores, complete optional tasks, and discover hidden collectibles as you battle against Grimclaw’s forces.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And look, if you need more convincing, one of the programmers of the original Star Fox — Giles Goddard — is working on this game' he's also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/stunt_race_fx">Stunt Race FX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080° Snowboarding</a>. of course, his most important work is in helping bring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> to GameCube.</p>
<p>Oh, and this is the same studio that worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cursed_to_golf">Cursed to Golf</a>. Basically, Wild Blue Skies looks absolutely lovely, and we would really like to see this on Switch.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get some news on other platforms soon!</p>

<figure data-uuid="da9384b98c7f2"><a title="Mario Galaxy Rosalina's Storybook" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/da9384b98c7f2/mario-galaxy-rosalinas-storybook.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo surprised us all back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a> with the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> — our first chance to play the latter on modern hardware in <em>15 years</em>. What was perhaps even more surprising was the reveal of Rosalina's Storybook, a hardback edition of the in-game page-turner that would be arriving in book stores a few months after the game.</p>
<p>Well, the day of release is finally upon us! Rosalina's Storybook is now available from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOorjBh-pADv0QYnniN05v02d6vsG-TfDFVi9uokLBXpP6ZTRWJ8e">My Nintendo Store</a> for $24.99 (or your regional equivalent), or from a bunch of other storefronts, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rosalinas-Storybook-Nintendo/dp/1506754902/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3GT8eJ_Pq9l9H4bUowCmpP16_qC-bT9pYu4wza_QqzoxwyQ0C7siKCKdrk2RyL2M409SBi0Ot_XpZuCfgtC3_7URhBjBtcV4rRQCXCh_olm8TVOfno18L3Azm_s0R0gStkNb6uXGdq2p0lHJPmQQWoO97Gu5wHwwKygEqna50Sw7xI9FHzMHEvyunDYHH0WGozV_8Xo9oCnmcfp7FwuR8ePcqnKcUVmLsB2B5bV503c.tfK6Je2N0XPqluVRHGK2bSnu9Y-TsyLjIQXo6eXZDgM&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;qid=1764086601&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANintendo&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3&amp;text=Nintendo" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/rosalinas-storybook/nintendo/9781506754901">Waterstones</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytws0BZJ-l_eg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890yojgiz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Much as you might expect, the book contains all the pages from the <em>original</em> game, retelling the story of a young girl and her relationship to the Lumas. Weirdly, it does not contain the new pages which were added for the Switch re-release, which feels like a bit of an oversight.</p>
<p>Either way, here's the book's official description from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.<br>
Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present <em>Rosalina’s Storybook</em> —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>

<p>We know that the book, or some variation of it, will cameo in the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, with <strong>Captain Marvel</strong>'s Brie Larson taking on the all-important role of reading it as Rosalina. Larson joins <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> director Benny Safdie (Bowser Jr.) as the movie's new voice cast, whom we'll get to hear in full next April.</p>
<p>But the big question is, will you be picking up a copy of this galactic text for yourself? Sure, it might be a story we've all heard before, but it sure would look nice on a shelf. You can let us know if you've already nabbed yours in the following poll.</p>
