<p>2022's excellent indie RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chained_echoes">Chained Echoes</a>' DLC, 'Ashes of Elrant', is coming to Switch on <strong>7th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/indie-rpg-hit-chained-echoes-announces-ashes-of-elrant-dlc">announced earlier this year</a>, publisher Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger today shared a brand new trailer for the story-based DLC today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006">on Steam</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-launches-august-7">Gematsu</a>). Ashes of Elrant was originally planned for Q2 of this year, and August is a <em>little</em> out of that window, but the studio (founded by Matthias Linda) admits that while the DLC was ready, the various translations weren't, so they decided to hold back.</p>
<p>The upcoming DLC sounds absolutely huge and includes a brand new land to explore, over 40 new enemies, a new playable character, more than 15 new music tracks from composer Eddie Marianukroh, new minigames, and new equipment.</p>
<p>Other than the trailer and those little bullet points listed above, here's what else we know about the DLC from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350260/Chained_Echoes_Ashes_of_Elrant/">its Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ashes of Elrant</strong> takes place right before the end of <strong>Chained Echoes</strong>. While you and your clan are preparing for the final fight, a new call for help reaches the Crimson Wings. This mission will reveal more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past. What challenges await you in a new land where nothing is as it seems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this sounds like a must-play if you loved the base game, which we did. We'll be suiting up in our mechs all over again this August, then.</p>
