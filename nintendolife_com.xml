<figure data-uuid="a331f14a956ca"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a331f14a956ca/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The world of video games hasn't provided much respite from global issues recently, not for those of us who love games and the people who make them. The issues facing the industry and players post-COVID — including mass layoffs, cancelled projects, questionable acquisitions, the encroachment of generative AI, rising prices, an unstable economy and a cost-of-living crisis — mean it's easy to assume there's no going back.</p>
<p>But just when you catch yourself pondering whether the good ol' days of games as an artistic medium and pastime are numbered, just when it looks like we're hurtling down a F2P, games-as-a-service slide greased with AI-generated turds, Nintendo goes and proves that there's life in the old console model yet.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">hardware numbers following launch</a> have been encouraging, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">today's financial results</a> give a much better picture of Switch 2's status, including figures from its first full quarter on the market. Any console from the big platform holders would be expected to sell well early doors, but numbers from July to September have maintained good momentum throughout a summer period where sales traditionally dry up in the biggest gaming territories.</p>
<p>To recap, Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since launch, causing the company to bump up its first-year sales forecast from 15 to 19 million ahead of the holidays. Software forecasts have also been bumped from 45 to 48 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="061603600aafb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/061603600aafb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>As you might expect, especially when its successor offers very broad backwards compatibility with performance improvements, Switch 1 numbers have plummeted 60% year-on-year. Yet 1.89 million isn't a bad figure either, and Nintendo still thinks it can sell 4 million OG Switches this financial year, half a million fewer than previous forecasts. Switch 1 is just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">10,000 units away from DS' all-time console record</a>, with only the PS2 ahead of that. And despite the hardware decline, S1 software forecasts have gone up by 20 million to 125 million. More positive news for Nintendo's accountants.</p>
<p>Games-wise, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle worked wonders (with most people presumably avoiding the $80 standalone price), with 9.57 million copies of the game out there as of 30th September. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 3.49 million units to date. Not Mario Kart numbers, but healthy for a non-bundled release; around a third of all Switch 2 owners also have a copy of DKB. It's never going to trouble MKW's current, colossal 92% attach rate, but the ape is holding his own.</p>
<figure data-uuid="931c4e78e3c32"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/931c4e78e3c32/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>High prices and uncertainty in the US made it a tricky launch; with Microsoft and Sony increasing hardware prices this year, Nintendo had a tricky needle to thread with its pricing. But despite the hashtags and general dismay at an $80 Mario Kart — at present, Nintendo's only non-NS2 Edition game at that price point — and increased accessory costs, the numbers speak for themselves. They threaded that needle well enough.</p>
<p>The system could have been rushed out last year, but again, holding back and stockpiling hardware to satisfy demand has paid dividends, with the ball rolling nicely over the summer months. Despite industry trends and suboptimal circumstances, Nintendo has proved that the market is still there, the appetite still healthy. People <em>are</em> still willing to pay for quality. The slow and steady approach has paid off. The strategy is working.</p>
<p>The third-party support has been excellent, too. Sure, multiplatform gamers may have played a lot of these games before, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> discontent is real, but looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">the best games on Switch 2 so far</a>, 'old' games or otherwise, the quality is undeniable.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ecc82dfd0fd1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ecc82dfd0fd1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wider problems with the games industry surround us still. While PS5 is selling well, Sony's hardly had the most exciting generation, benefiting as Microsoft lurches between <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody-says-xbox-exec-defending-game-pass-changes">PR disasters</a> and makes Xbox a less viable option by the day. Price increases across the board, however, seem to be making the value proposition of gaming hardware and subscription services worse all the time.</p>
<p>Yet here's Nintendo putting out a little tablet console that, against the odds, is tracking very favourably with its trailblazing predecessor. Switch 2 certainly isn't cheap, and it's arguably still lacking its truly killer app, its 'I <em>must</em> own a Switch 2 to play Game X!' Mario Kart was a great opening salvo. Bananza is brilliant, but it's not a Mario. Switch 2 doesn't have its Breath of the Wild yet. (In fact, you could argue that, weirdly, Switch 2's BOTW <em>is</em> BOTW, but that's another article.)</p>
<p>What it does offer, though, has been enough for more-than-enough people. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">The launch had its stresses</a>, but Nintendo has maintained the momentum beyond that opening month and is very well-placed to get stuck in over the holidays and into the new year with a packed and varied lineup. Next quarter's results — the October-November-December crop — will include figures for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>
<p>That's four brand new games, including two S2 exclusives, and we already know that Pokémon had a monster-sized launch, scoring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">the US' biggest physical launch since</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Packed, varied, and super effective indeed - and that's just the first-party-published stuff.</p>
<figure data-uuid="41c00c3939cc3"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41c00c3939cc3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few months, I've pondered if peppering umpteen NS2 Edition upgrades between its brand new S2 exclusives would be enough to get people on board and sufficiently excited to splash out on a pricey console, despite the pent-up desire for something new. For all the buzz, the next Animal Crossing is, well, the 'old' Animal Crossing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">with some Bells and whistles</a>. Will that be enough? Will the inevitable 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Hyper Fighting Dash Dojo EX' keep this ball rolling?</p>
<p>All evidence points to 'Yes, absolutely.' Well played, Nintendo.</p>

And folks, it's looking and sounding <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>This is the third Hyrule Warriors game and is completely canonical, set long before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Taking place during the Imprisoning War, it follows Zelda after she's been transported back in time, basically filling in the gaps on what the princess was doing while she was stuck in the past.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>For our very own PJ O'Reilly, it's probably the best Hyrule Warriors game to date, with near-perfect performance, deliriously fun combat, and a pretty solid story, the only downside is that the maps are a little safe. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PJ's 9/10 review</a> concludes that "Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1762277401 -->
<p>But of <em>course</em> we're not the only ones who have covered the game. While some outlets are holding back until launch day (due to embargo restrictions), there are plenty of critics willing to share their thoughts on Age of Imprisonment.</p>
<p>Let's start near the top, shall we? <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/">RPG Site</a> is equally as glowing as us on the game, rewarding it a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">9/10</a>, with reviewer James Galizio even calling it "a sleeper hit for my personal game of the year." The story strikes a good balance between Zelda and the other characters, and the game is stuffed full of the best Musou combat to date:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Age of Imprisonment isn't just a great Zelda spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire Zelda series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down a notch, <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/">CGMagazine</a>'s Chris de Hoog awards Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">an 8.5/10</a> and an Editor's Choice, calling the story "a fulfilling complement" to TOTK, with particular praise given to the blend of the mainline game's combat with the Warriors formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> had me hooked for its entire 30-hour+ quest, always torn between wanting to see what happened next in the story and seeking out the components to unlock new features for the characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another outlet praising the game's combat is <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/">VGC</a>, with friend of the site and NL contributor Chris Scullion awarding Zelda's Musou outing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">a 4/5</a>. If you're still worried about the frame rate, then here's another review stating that "noticeable" dips below 60fps are "rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat is the best in the Hyrule Warriors series to date, and once you’ve reached the credits, about 18-20 hours in, there’s still a hell of a lot to do thanks to a large map filled with side-quests, unlockable characters, and other missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TJ Denzer over at <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/">Shacknews</a> joins the performance cheers with <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/146650/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-score">an 8/10 review</a>, but is less enthusiastic about the sidequests and music. However, the combat is once again the star (we're also <em>big</em> fans of that headline, 'Ultrahanding out beatdowns'):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying out Switch Skills and Sync Attacks between practically every pair of characters were some of my favorite things in this game and I hope Koei Tecmo tries something like them in future games..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slipping into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">7/10</a> scores we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">GameSpot</a>'s Richard Wakeling, who says that performance issues "are almost completely absent". The downsides come in the form of an inconsequential story and a lack of mission variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story doesn't feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor's performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, Age of Imprisonment marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/">Gamesradar+</a>'s Oscar Taylor-Kent is a little more muted, awarding the game a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">3/5</a> citing "underutilized" spaces and "bland maps" with many missions lacking "depth", but combat is "sharply improved" compared to previous Hyrule Warriors games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I have more fun revisiting the less fully featured Age of Calamity, something has gone amiss. They did call it Age of Imprisonment, I suppose – but I wish they'd let me off the leash a little. Zelda's beam sword hungers for more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is sitting on a respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">78 on Metacritic from 52 reviews</a> (at the time of writing this), but that number will change over the coming days. OpenCritic sits at a similar <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19291/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">77 but from only 18 reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Still, you'll be able to judge for yourself when Age of Imprisonment launches on Switch 2 on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>. What a treat, hey?</p>
