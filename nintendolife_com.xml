<p>But it will have "full crossplay"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bcb028bc3af9/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> for the Switch 2, we've had a number of updates from Randy Pitchford and the team at Gearbox Software about what exactly fans can expect.</p>
<p>Following the news last month the game would run at "mostly" 30fps (instead of 60fps) on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware, we've now got another Switch 2-related update. This was spotted in the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNQ5NRRFJZ170AXZSQYQ7">game's official FAQ</a>, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
<p>This version will apparently offer "the same exciting" experience as other platforms "minus the split-screen option". Although this is missing, the same paragraph notes how the Nintendo release will have crossplay support with the other platforms. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full crossplay with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to enjoy some split-screen action on a single Switch 2 device, it seems you may need to instead consider the game on another console platform for this particular option.</p>
<p>It was also confirmed not long ago how the Switch 2 physical release of Borderlands 4 will require a download, so expect a Game-Key Card release. This game launches for this platform on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56c21bd8dc43d/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many surprises during the Switch 2 reveal in April was the new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, a sequel to the GameCube outing.</p>
<p>It's scheduled to arrive later this year, so what's the latest? Game director Masahiro Sakurai has issued another small update <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1956187495991009776">via social media today</a>, mentioning how he thinks the team should be able to share some information about this game soon.</p>
<p>This small update on this project about Kirby's new game lines up with Sora's 20th anniversary in 2025 – with Sakurai thanking fans for their "continued support" over the years. Here's a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "It doesn't matter to most people, but today, Sora Co., Ltd. is celebrating its 20th anniversary. …That's a long time! Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>"The new game *Kirby Air Rider* hasn't even shown gameplay footage yet, but I think we'll be able to share some information soon. Please wait!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest update on Kirby Air Riders follows the game getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">classification last month</a>. Sakurai also mentioned in July how the title was "shaping up to be something great".</p>
<p>Again, Kirby Air Riders is scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, so hopefully we'll at least get some gameplay footage soon. In the meantime, you can take another look at the announcement cinematic.</p>

<p>Scalpers are reportedly at it again, and this time they're targeting exclusive merch available at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, there are already eBay listings popping up for the commemorative Pikachu plush, themed TCG playmats, card binders, the <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1955663752457810413">jukebox</a> and various other items available at the event taking place in Anaheim, California this weekend.</p>
<p>Although there's a "one-per-person" rule in place at the venue, scalpers are still taking advantage of the fact the merch is currently exclusive to this event. Some of the community is already highlighting the scenes at the World Championships, as well as the resellers and online listings.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnjuhlw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's one post, in particular, that's been called out by the Pokémon community. And below this are some scenes from the Pokémon Center pop-up at the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Selling 2025 worlds bearwalker and shiny gyarados statue. $1000 on bearwalker and $600 on shiny gyarados statue. Payment up front. Zelle/PP FF/cashapp preferably. Pm me if interested. Thanks"</p>
</blockquote>






<p>It's sad to see this sort of behaviour, as it continues to ruin the hobby for many legitimate Pokémon fans and collectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this follows a story earlier this week about McDonald's Japan having to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">pull its Pokémon TCG Happy Meal promotion</a> after 24 hours because of similar issues tied to scalping – with one customer supposedly attempting to buy 40 Happy Meals. The fast food giant even issued a formal apology.</p>

<p>If you happen to be heading to the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California this weekend, you can receive a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> distribution.</p>
<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Apart from this, the Pokémon World Championships will also be offering trainers a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/tune-in-to-worlds-to-get-luca-ceribellis-farigiraf-and-other-special-gifts">special Farigiarf this weekend</a>.

<p>To obtain this Pokémon, you'll need to watch the official 2025 Worlds livestream for a password you can then use in the Mystery Gift feature of Scarlet and Violet. The password can only be used one time "per save", and it expires on <strong>August 22, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see the full schedule for the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in our previous post. There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-playable-switch-2-demo-appearing-at-upcoming-events">also a Switch 2 demo</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> at this event. This follows on from a free Switch 2 upgrade for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in June, which included frame rate improvements and a higher resolution update.</p>

<p>We know very few details right now, except that the panel will be a 90-minute megaton "showcasing all of Capcom’s recent and upcoming releases." It all kicks off at <strong>3:45 pm EST on Friday 10th October</strong> — we've listed times for the showcase below, but note that these NYCC panels aren't often broadcast unless you pay for <a href="https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/en-us/memberships.html">Popverse membership</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7jstzgr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, this is far from the first time Capcom has been to Comic-Con — the company has attended multiple times over the years. But In terms of Switch and Switch 2 games, the only real new game appearance is likely to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>. But we may get a look at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC too?</p>
<p>However, we'd recommend that you don't get your hopes up <em>too</em> much for any major announcements. But really, we'd love to see some <strong>Mega Man</strong>. C'mon, Capcom! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mega-man-is-one-of-capcoms-most-important-ips-despite-no-new-games-in-7plus-years">You said it was one of your "most-important IPs!"</a></p>
