            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Sometimes simplicity is key, and when such simplicity is available for a decent price (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT46HMRB?th=1&amp;tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">$36.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment), that’s an even sweeter peach to sink your teeth into. Don’t bite the tomtoc FancyCase G05, mind you, although in all likelihood you wouldn’t do any damage to the console inside.</p>
<p>Yes, it might look simple from the outside (and it is), but this little case is well worth a look if you want to keep your Switch 2 console safe. The first thing you’ll notice is that this is a <em>slim</em> case. There’s very little wasted space at all, and when a gap is present, it’s for a good reason. There are even raised areas in the top in which your Joy-Con sticks can safely nestle themselves.</p>
<p>The exterior of the case is <em>reasonably</em> hard. I mean, it’s got a little bit of give to it, but in all honesty that’s not a bad thing, as it should help absorb any impact force from when you inevitably drop your console whilst waiting at the bus stop. Butterfingers.</p>
<p>There’s a handle at the top as well, which can double as a wrist strap should you want to use it. We’re not entirely sure why you would, but I suppose if it’s strapped to you directly you’re less likely to drop it whilst waiting at the bus stop.</p>

<p>Inside, the plush, velvet-like lining provides a nice little bit of cushioning for your device, including an extra bit of padding to make sure your shoulder buttons have adequate clearance, and the classic flap that folds over the screen also homes some elasticated slots in which you can store your games.</p>
<p>As a small bonus, mine even came with a few little dummy cards made of… well, card, that say ‘Name’ and ‘Contact’ on each side. Keep one of these in your case and should you lose it, whoever finds it should be able to get in touch with you. Assuming they’re honest, naturally.</p>
<p>All things considered, there’s not much to say about this case, but that’s a <em>good</em> thing. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it gets the fundamentals absolutely bang-on. It’s the functional option, and that is no bad thing.</p>

<p>"Plenty of toilet humour"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Art of Play, Boat Rocker Media, and the BBC have announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danger_mouse">Danger Mouse</a> game based on the hit cartoon series from the '80s.</p>
<p>Scheduled for launch in <strong>2026</strong>, Danger Mouse will be a side-scrolling affair with 15 levels to work through. Co-op play will be available to include Penfold as a playable character, and the title is said to include "plenty of toilet humour", so we're definitely morbidly intrigued to see what that entails.</p>
<p>There's little else to note at the moment, but from the few screenshots available at the time of writing, the visuals actually look pretty cool; very faithful! We'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one in the coming months.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 15 Levels – Side-scrolling, arcade battle action, super danger-filled levels!<br>
- Team Up – As Danger Mouse and Penfold in cooperative multiplayer to take on the Baron’s evil epic do-overs!<br>
- Take Control – Of the iconic Mark IV to drive, dive, fly, and tap dance your way to victory again…!<br>
- Plenty of Toilet Humor – But no potty mouth. Just incredibly dangerous foes to battle all over the globe!<br>
- Time Wasters – Errr… um… We mean mini games. Yes. Mini games!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a find!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pikachu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b9699422f05d/pikachu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's amazing what you can find in the bottom of a bin sometimes, right? Not that we frequently go scurrying around in trash, you understand... But y'know, there are definitely occasions when something rare and potentially very valuable has been unknowingly thrown away.</p>
<p>Case in point, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElbowDeepInElmo/">ElbowDeepInElmo</a> (lovely...) has posted images of a Pikachu statue that they state was rescued from the trash by a printing company responsible for the early runs of Pokémon cards (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pikachu-statue-that-was-salvaged-from-the-trash-turns-out-to-be-official-promotional-material-from-1999-us-premiere-of-pokemon-the-first-movie/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>According to the poster, it's not just any statue, but rather a piece of promotional material that was used for <strong>Pokémon: The First Movie</strong> when the film had its premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in 1999.</p>

<p>The Pikachu is sadly missing its tail, which was likely thrown away at the same time as the main statue itself, but the poster is hoping to have a replacement tail 3D printed to make the statue complete once again.</p>
<p>It's also been made clear that the statue is not currently for sale or trade at the time of writing. We reckon it might be worth quite a bit at this point, mind you, even if it is missing its tail.</p>
<p>You can <em>just about</em> see the statue in the archival footage from the premiere below, which in itself is a wild trip down memory lane, even if you weren't there yourself. Ah, those were the days...</p>

<p><em>What do you make of this extraordinary find? Have you got any rare or interesting Pokémon merchandise or promotional material from back in the day? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>
