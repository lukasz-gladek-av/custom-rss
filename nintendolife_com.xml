<p>Just breathtaking</p>

<p>It looks like Square Enix is still celebrating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>'s 30th anniversary — and why shouldn't it? This is one of the most-beloved RPGs of all time.</p>
<p>And today, as a tasty little treat, the company's Japanese YouTube channel has shared a video showcasing close-ups of some of the game's character art and promotional artwork. (thanks to modder and video producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohpoorpup.bsky.social/post/3lz7edbj5mc2f">Christa Lee for highlighting</a>!)</p>
<p>The video appears to be a behind-the-scenes look at Square Enix's reproductions of the late, great Akira Toriyama's artwork. Individual characters, the campfire scene, and the battle scene that graces the game's North American box art are among the works shown off.</p>
<p>As for the reason? Well, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/novacrystallis.com/post/3lz5zz4bwxc2s">according to Nova Crystallis</a>, this is all for a social media campaign that Square Enix is holding. If you follow the company's <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1968885383627948195">Japanese account on X</a> (formerly Twitter) and respond with your favourite character along with the appropriate hashtag, you'll be in with a chance of winning a piece of art.</p>

<p>It looks like the competition itself is exclusive to Japan, but honestly, the video itself is also a great way of seeing these pieces of iconic art in 2160p, 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The colour and the linework is absolutely beautiful, and we're honestly jonesing to get a piece of that art for our offices...</p>

<p>Earlier today, Square Enix also announced the 'CHRONO TRIGGER Piano Soundscape Arrangement' album, which launches in Japan on 26th November 2025 for 3,300 yen (plus tax). With 12 newly-arranged songs, largely focusing on character themes, this is a must for fans of the iconic score, we think.</p>
<p>Let's hope even more Chrono Trigger celebrations are on the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb741be92b82d/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report states that Nintendo of America is cutting loose around 200 long-time contractor jobs as it has decided to outsource its customer support services ahead of the Switch 2's first holiday season.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season">IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, who spoke to numerous customer support staff and sources under anonymity. Many confirmed to the outlet that they were told back in March 2025 that their contracts were being cut and gradually being phased out. None of the contractors have received direct communication from Nintendo itself, hearing instead through their agencies about the news.</p>
<p>Now these contractors are expected to train their replacements, many of whom are based in South American countries, primarily in Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua. These have previously been limited to first-line contacts who act as representatives to send the information and problem on to the main team in the US.</p>
<p>There are concerns from the sources that there will, "in the immediate term" be a drop in quality of support, particularly once the fully-trained agents leave, with the Big N seeming to prioritise saving.</p>
<p>While the new contractors all speak English, some IGN spoke to said there were "a number of communication issues internally" with an "increase in customers becoming irate, belligerent, and even racially abusive".</p>
<p>Nintendo of America, in a response to IGN, has stated that "the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information" and that "our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive." The company did not respond to requests on which claims were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Here is NoA's full response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>One source told IGN that Nintendo of America normally works with two US-based agencies to fill customer support roles, including fraud, chargebacks, chatlogs, phone and email support, refunds, repair support and more. "There are a few people remaining on-site overseeing it, but essentially it’s all going away.”</p>
<p>A former employee acknowledges the nature of being a contractor and that "there was no guarantee to return after contract breaks", but feels that Nintendo could have approached things differently. "I personally feel as though Nintendo could have easily hired on a bunch of the contractors as FTE and had better results while still saving money from having to use the agencies."</p>
<p>"It's also such a volatile economy to be dumping all of us out into", with others echoing similar concerns, especially with the rise of generative AI in the customer support field: "“A lot of us are feeling betrayed, empty, like almost led-on in a way."</p>
<p>This is sadly not the first time Nintendo has cut contractor jobs suddenly. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/nintendo-of-america-restructuring-testing-department-over-100-contractor-jobs-reportedly-eliminated">NoA downsized and restructured its testing department</a>, with a reported 100+ contractors losing their jobs.</p>
