<p>From the team behind Cruis'n Blast</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Arcade racing fans have another game to look forward to this year, with GameMill Entertainment announcing it will be bringing <strong>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</strong> to the Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>24th October, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/cruisn_blast">Cruis'n Blast</a> vibes from this one, that's because developer Raw Thrills was behind the original 2022 arcade cabinet release. Cradle Games (which helped out with the port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_arcade_wrath_of_the_mutants">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants</a>) is assisting with this latest home console release.</p>
<p>Here's a brief description about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Experience the thrill of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade in attract mode! This video showcases the high-speed action and immersive arcade gameplay that makes this racing game a must-play for arcade enthusiasts. Watch as we dive into the heart-pounding excitement of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade, where players can race through iconic locations, drive powerful cars, and experience the ultimate arcade attraction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Raw Thrills released Cruis'n Blast on Switch in 2021, we called it a hugely entertaining arcade-style racer, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>
<p>Much like Cruis'n Blast, Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition also features licensed cars and includes all kinds of action-packed sequences. As noted in the press release and video above, racers can look forward to split-screen multiplayer as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hit the road in legendary cars including the Dodge Charger, Corvette Z06, Shelby GT500 KR, Ford GT, Bronco DR, Jeep Wrangler and more - plus customize your car with unique color schemes.</p>
<p>Race through each of the original arcade gameâ€™s tracks solo or in split-screen with a friend and discover destructible environments, branching paths, and sneaky shortcuts that can shake up any race and reward risk-takers. Take on thrilling challenges with high-stakes objectives like intercepting a missile in the Swiss Alps or grounding a plane in the heart of Hong Kong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press package also includes a look at a European physical Switch release. It mentions how this is a "download code only".</p>
