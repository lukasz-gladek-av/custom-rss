<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Predictions" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a72fe1248e8c/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-predictions.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>What's that? You thought the arrival of Switch 2 a mere two weeks ago would be enough to halt the hype train for a while? Oh no, no, dear readers, Nintendo is full steam ahead, reminding us what's <em>next</em> for the freshest console on the block. The next station stop: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>A Direct presentation focused on DK's upcoming adventure will be heading our way tomorrow, <strong>18th June 2025</strong>, at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT, 3pm CEST</strong>. We know that it'll be 15 minutes long and that it will contain "information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," but that's it. The precise details are still up in the air, so strap in folks, it's time for some speculation.</p>
<p>Below, a handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared what we're hoping to see in this DK-focused...bananza. Have a gander through our predictions and then take to the comments to share your own.</p>

<h2>Kongs &amp; cameras (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e98789382cb98/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo was proud to showcase a certain familiar face in Donkey Kong Bananza's Treehouse footage (it was Cranky Kong, in case you missed it), and I would be very surprised if ol' grandpa is the <em>only</em> Kong Kameo in the game — let's not forget, we haven't seen DK in a 3D capacity like this since the character-stuffed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. My money's on Diddy Kong making an appearance, especially with that redesign out there, but I'll lose my mind if we see Funky.</p>
<p>The only other thing that I'd like to feel a <em>little</em> more secure about is the camera. I loved what I played at the Switch 2 Hands-On Experience a few months back, but all that tunnelling and rock smashing didn't make for the easiest camera controls. If this Direct can show me the exploration sections running 10% smoother, I'll be fully back on board.</p>
<h2>A reason to go bananas (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3892927a3439f/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing Donkey Kong Bananza at the Nintendo Switch 2 event back in April, I came away feeling slightly more concerned than elated. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast tearing through the environment and finding little ore deposits, but I can't help but wonder if that was all there is to it.</p>
<p>I'm sure Nintendo has lots more up its sleeve for Bananza, so that's mainly what I'm hoping to see. If this is truly by the team that made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> (which I still find myself doubting), then I want to see gameplay mechanics that have my jaw dropping to the floor. Smashing bits of rock is fine for a while, but I don't know if this can stretch to keep me compelled for the entire game.</p>
<h2>Lots of smashing, no frame rate drops (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33c32f48c28d1/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very, very excited about this new DK entry. I love the look of it, I love all the smashing, but I am concerned that it might end up struggling a bit in terms of its frame rate and end up making my new console feel underpowered.</p>
<p>Yes, it'll most likely be fine, I do like to worry about nothing. More positively, the idea of this Odyssey style of caper with everyone's favourite ape front and centre feels like it should have happened ages ago, and if the gameplay can match its looks I think we're in for a good time. Just make sure it's a nice, stutter-free time, too, please.</p>
<h2>K. Rool intentions (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros. Ultimate K. Rool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/113455f5ff6aa/smash-bros-ultimate-k-rool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Give me a K. Rool and a pair of boxing gloves, and I'll be happy. A few more worlds and a look at some of the deeper mechanics. Maybe a deep-cut Kong or two - I've got a soft spot for DK64, so a little Lanky or Chunky would be great.</p>
<p>I'm just looking for something that doesn't pour cold water on my enthusiasm, really. I went into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Mario Kart World Direct</a> expecting to be dazzled...and it was essentially a recap of everything we already knew, and I ended up coming away significantly less excited for the game.</p>
<p>Let's try and give the hardcore fans a little more to chew on this time while ticking those mainstream messaging tick boxes, please Nintendo.</p>
<h2>Peeling off the layers (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81257345da9bb/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After feeling a bit deflated from Mario Kart's collectibles, I want to know more about what DK has to offer. I know, exciting stuff, right? But I just want some creative, fun rewards that actually feel meaningful rather than a little challenge. And Bananza's destructibility gives tons of room for that.</p>
<p>Outside of that, a little look at some of the other levels in a bit more detail, some returning faces (no one here has mentioned Dixie... tut tut), and that's about it. I don't need a deep dive, just a little teaser of what to expect. Individual game Directs don't really get me that excited anyway, but I'm ready to be surprised.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>HGiG or not HGiG, that is the question</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've been feeling (as this writer has) that your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> graphics look a little washed out on your TV set in docked mode, guess what? It seems a bunch of other folk have too. What's more, there's an actual reason for it, and it can be fixed. Sort of. Hooray!</p>
<p>The video above from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hdtvtest">YouTuber HDTVTest</a> addresses the issue we've encountered on an LG OLED TV set. We've had a little fiddle this morning (careful now) and we can confirm that our Switch 2 is looking much better, much richer, and more vibrant on our OLED TVs thanks to the tips in this useful breakdown of what's up with the console's HDR.</p>
<p>So, what <em>is</em> up with it? In short, there are a bunch of problems outlined here, all revolving around a setting know as HGiG (HDR Gaming Interest Group), that deals with tone mapping whilst playing games.</p>
<p>When in your HDR adjustment settings in docked mode on Switch 2, you're presented with a test pattern of two suns. Adjusting these so the one on the right disappears gives you the best HDR setting. Simple.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 HRD Fix vid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79b592b711e16/switch-2-hrd-fix-vid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>However! TV sets <em>without HGiG</em> have an issue. With the setting turned on, the test performs as it should, but turned off it makes the test perform incorrectly, so you max out <em>way</em> above the recommended nits whilst attempting to calibrate HDR. Hence, the washed-out image quality.</p>
<p>The video mentions that there are also a huge number of increments to the adjustments with Nintendo's HDR configuration (you can click a whole lot of times with very little difference to the image), which makes the process feel more granular and ineffective. They compare this functionality to Xbox and PlayStation, which have fewer steps to toggle through on their HDR setting screen, and are therefore more readable and easier to adjust.</p>
<p>HDTVTest also discusses Switch 2's "suboptimal default paper white settings," which the video says are off out of the box and tied into HDR settings in a strange way. There's a <em>very detailed</em> breakdown of all of this in the vid so do make sure to check it all out, it's well worth the 10 minutes it takes.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdd782dba12d3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're anything like us, then chances are you've been handling your Switch 2 like it's a ticking timebomb. There's nothing quite as soul-crushing as when a new piece of tech gets a nasty dent on the casing or a horrible scratch on the screen. It feels like the end of the world.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, reports are starting to emerge that the screen is proving to be particularly susceptible to scratches, with a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spintherism/">Spintherism</a> gathering plenty of comments from users stating that their own consoles are becoming all scratched up.</p>
<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueBrawler2001/">TheTrueBrawler2001</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yep, my Switch 2 got scratched from the dock. I've confirmed with my retailer that I can trade it in for a new one once they receive more inventory, but I'm out of luck until then. Already purchased a screen protector in anticipation. If I get a new Switch 2 before it arrives, then I'm not even opening the Switch 2 box until then so I can put it on immediately and protect the new screen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even our own lovely video producer Felix has confirmed that his Switch 2 has received a fair few light scratches since launch. The general consensus seems to be that, like the Switch OLED before it, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2s-screen-comes-with-a-pre-applied-film-layer-dont-peel-it-off">actually the protective plastic film getting all scratched up</a>, not the screen itself.</p>
<p>That would be fine – reassuring, even – but Nintendo has explicitly stated that users should not remove the protective film in order to prevent shards of glass flying about in the event of a severe breakage. So with that in mind, yes, the screen is effectively getting all scratched up, even though it <em>technically</em> isn't.</p>
<p>Touch wood, this writer hasn't experienced anything of the sort yet (<em>though I do also have an extra screen protector applied, just in case</em>), but we'd now like to hand it over to you. Has your Switch 2's screen gathered any nasty scratches yet?</p>
