<p>Coming in Light Purple and Light Green — though they're a the new set was officially unveiled on the Nintendo Today! app and is the first set of new Joy-Con 2 colours for the Switch 2 since the console's launch.</p>
<p>They're a rather nice contrast to the Switch 2's black colour scheme, and softer than the current default of blue and red.</p>

<p>Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but we imagine that this set will cost the same (or a little more) than the current standard Joy-Con 2.</p>

<p>New balls, please</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has served up a five-minute <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> overview trailer, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming sports title.</p>
<p>The big focus right from the jump is the titular Fever Rackets, which grant special power-ups to your shots or movement. The trailer gives us another look at the Flame Shot and Ice Racket, but there's also the enemy-summoning Pokey Racket, the helping hand Shadow Racket, and the speedy Golden Dash Racket. Some of these can even deal damage to your opponent, because the one thing that tennis is really missing is <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>But these Fever effects aren't the be-all and end-all. As explained in the new overview, if you can send the Fever ball back before it bounces, the effect will be sent back with it — gosh, <em>the tension</em>!</p>
<p>Those after something a little more standard can play in 'Classic Rules', removing the Fever Rackets and putting more focus on the new Slide and Leap shots.</p>
<p>We get a closer look at more of those teased 38 playable characters, too, with Goomba, Nabbit and Baby Waluigi getting some time in the spotlight, and those with a keen eye will also spot the likes of Dry Bones, Bowser Jr. and more.</p>
<p>As for game modes, there's Tournament, the challenge-based Trial Towers, and the Baby 'Adventure' mode that we saw in the initial reveal.</p>
<p>And yes, GameShare is also enabled in this one, so you can play with friends online even if they don't own a copy of the game.</p>
