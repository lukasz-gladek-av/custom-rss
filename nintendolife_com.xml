It has also reminded us all that Switch 2 bundles exist, because <em>of course</em>.</p>
<p>So, kicking things off with those games. From 23rd November, a lineup of select first-party titles will be dropping down to $29.99 or $39.99 at select US retailers, including the official Nintendo Stores in New York City and San Francisco. Here's the range of titles seeing a price cut this year:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lsiwxg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

</ul>
<p>These are all Switch 1 releases, of course, but there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free Switch 2 performance upgrades</a> available for the likes of Echoes of Wisdom, Odyssey and Splatoon 3, so those playing on the new system will at least see some benefits.</p>
<p>And while we're on Switch 2, no, there has not been a Black Friday bundle announced — which makes sense, given the system is still less than six months old. That said, Nintendo has reminded us all in its Black Friday listings that the console is still available both by itself for $449.99 and bundled with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for $499.99.</p>

<p>A select lineup of the system's new amiibo will be subjected to a discount, mind you, with the four <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> Sage amiibo (that's Tulin, Yunobo, Riju and Sidon) and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series (Jamie, Kimberly and Luke, <em>and</em> the amiibo Card Starter Set) seeing a $10 discount at select retailers.</p>
<p>Finally, Nintendo has announced that it will be introducing a seasonal $20 saving on Samsung MicroSD Express Cards on 30th November. This one could be worth keeping an eye on if you're aiming to pick up more Switch 2 software over the holiday period.</p>
<p>For those simply after something digital, the usual Cyber Deals sale will be getting underway on 20th November and will be sticking around until 3rd December, so expect digital deals aplenty.</p>
<p>All in all, it's business as usual for Nintendo's North American Black Friday lineup this year. It would have been grand to see Switch 2 get some discounts, but it's hardly surprising that Nintendo is keeping the boat steady while the console continues to break sales records at its current price. Maybe next year we'll see some, eh?</p>

<p>The latest slice of Hylian musou action is finally here, and it's making the most of the Switch 2's beefed-up specs to mark the occasion. That means more frames, more combat options and, yes, more enemies.</p>
<p>Thanks to all this, we loved AoI (as we're sure <em>nobody</em> is calling it). We scored Nintendo's latest a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">our review</a>, concluding, "With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is a dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike".</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2ukynst&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
