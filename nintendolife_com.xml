You made it! Congrats!</p>
<p>Of course, we start the year off by looking at the last month of 2025, December. And boy, what a December we had — probably one of the most-stacked we've ever had, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>'s release and a bunch of surprise Nintendo Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the eShop has been pretty busy, with some genuine surprises sneaking in before the Holiday season. So we've voted for the best of the best of the digital-only selection. The reles, as always: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from December 2025 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jvsktu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Alrighty then, let's have a look at the very best of December's eShop releases.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:195306,181925 @ 1767726003 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We don't think anyone was expecting the amount of game releases we got in December 2025. Usually, the end of the year is a little quieter, but we were kept rather busy in the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Of course, there are two bigger games we haven't had the chance to review yet — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped on Christmas Day in the US, and we're working on covering that very soon. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, which (now-former) Nintendo Lifer Felix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">ranks among his favourite games of the year</a>, also slipped through the cracks of a busy festive period.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a total of eight games that scored an 8//10 or above that are eShop exclusives (at the time of writing this). Here's the five that didn't quite make the top in a closely-fought battle of votes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">9/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">3rd Place - Marvel Cosmic Invasion (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Trust Tribute Games to give us a near-perfect Marvel beat 'em up in the same vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. And that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> is — not only a love letter to Marvel's rich comic book history, but a beautiful and excellent arcade side-scroller.</p>
<p>The roster is surprisingly robust and varied here, with every character feeling extremely distinct. And with the tag-team mechanic, you can play through the game multiple times with your favourite pairings and change things up as many times as you want. Add in the unlockable hard mode, and you have your new favourite co-op experience with a friend.</p>
<p>Available on both Switch 1 and 2 — and fantastic on both platforms — we scored the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Sonic Racing CrossWorlds -(Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Surprise! Speeding onto Switch 2 at the end of the 2025, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is <em>finally</em> fully realised on the newer console. Yes, it is getting a full physical later in 2026, but right now, this is a digital-only purchase or upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for this port, too, as CrossWorlds really struggled on the older hardware. Here, it's beautifully smooth with sharper resolutions and 60fps in both docked and handheld mode; all the other excellent bells and whistles are in tact, meaning this excellent racer can stand alongside Mario Kart World as one of the system's best, at least in the early days.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds scored an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10 from us</a>, and there's more free content and DLC to come in the future.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194831 @ 1767726003 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">1st Place - despelote (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>One of 2025's very best games released on other platforms earlier in 2025 — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/nobodys-really-heard-of-it-but-this-is-one-of-my-xbox-games-of-the-year-for-2025">Pure Xbox</a> is among the outlets celebrating it — and it <em>just</em> managed to squeak its way onto Switch in December. And thank goodness, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> is a special one, and it barely beat out Sonic to win December's eShop Selects.</p>
<p>This short, sweet game follows Julián as he reflects on the time Ecuador qualified for the 2002 World Cup. This is not a soccer game, though — it's a beautiful narrative tale about Julián's experience growing up amidst this fervour. It's largely flown under the radar, but those who have played it have raved about it. And we're joining the chorus.</p>
<p>despelote scored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/despelote">a well-deserved 9/10 from us</a> and takes the final eShop Selects trophy of 2025.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Open from <strong>Thursday, 12th February to Sunday, 15th February 2026</strong>, accessing the store will once again require a reservation, and more details for this will be shared closer to the time. As for what kind of exclusive products you can expect to find, The Pokémon Company has confirmed that Mega Evolution will play a big role this year thanks to its reintroduction in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</a></p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59nugqtr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's a look at the exact opening times for the store this coming February:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Thursday, 12 February: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.<br>
- Friday, 13 February: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m.<br>
- Saturday, 14 February: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m.<br>
- Sunday, 15 February: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that the Pokémon Center also doesn't accept cash as a payment option, so if you somehow still use cash as your primary payment method, then now's the time to break out the debit card.</p>
<p>For now, here's a small look at some of the merch that will be on offer:</p>

<p>We'll be sure to update you as soon as we hear more on securing those all-important reservations.</p>

<p>Yes, on <strong>9th January 2025</strong> (this Friday), <strong>South Park</strong> will enter the fray, though no specific details as to what this might entail have been shared at the time of writing.</p>
<p>All we've got for the time being is a small teaser via social media:</p>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Fortnite drop without a few leaks, mind you, and word on the street is that the content will include skins for Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, along with items relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/south_park_the_stick_of_truth">The Stick of Truth</a>. There may also be some South Park-themed environments, which would honestly be awesome.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if the leaks are accurate, but we're intrigued to see exactly how this pans out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jvsktu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
