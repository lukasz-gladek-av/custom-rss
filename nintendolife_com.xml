<p>Pre-order bonus revealed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has today opened up pre-orders for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, and there's a teaser of some additional side story DLC coming our way later in 2026.</p>
<p>The new trailer (above) finishes with a brief look at everything included in the game's 'Deluxe' and 'Premium Deluxe' Edition packages. It's mainly bonus armour and hair customisations, but there's also that 'Side Story: Rudy' mention to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It's a little vague, but here's the official summary of this DLC from the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/stories3/en-uk/">Twisted Reflection website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A side story about Rudy, whose family have served as Azurian Royal Palicoes for generations.<br>
One day, while accompanying the protagonist on a survey of some egg quartz, Rudy makes a surprising discovery!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That tells us... not a lot, honestly. The additional side story is expected to launch in Autumn 2026, so we're sure we'll hear a little more about the bonus in the coming months — the base game itself doesn't launch until <strong>13th March</strong>, let's not forget.</p>
<p>We know that the Rudy bonus is included as standard in the Deluxe and Premium Deluxe editions (the former of which is now available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Monster-Hunter-Stories-3-Twisted-Reflection-2951637.html#Deluxe_Edition">EU eShop</a> for £74.99), but Capcom is yet to reveal any info on purchasing the DLC separately.</p>
<p>Either way, keep an eye on those storefronts, because Twisted Reflections pre-orders are starting to roll out.</p>
