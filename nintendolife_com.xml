<figure data-uuid="089d0b230b630"><a title="Silent Hill 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/089d0b230b630/silent-hill-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake launched on <strong>8th October 2024</strong>, it was made clear that it would only be exclusive to the PS5 and PC for one year.</p>
<p>So now that we're approaching its first anniversary, the possibility of a Switch 2 release has grown after empty slots for two additional platforms have been discovered on the <a href="https://www.blooberteam.com/silent-hill-2">official website</a> by <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1974879946830131421">Rebs Gaming</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/silent-hill-2s-ps5-console-exclusivity-is-coming-to-an-end">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>There's no clear indication as to which platforms will be added, but it's reasonable to assume at this point that it'll be the Xbox Series X|S and the Switch 2 (though a Linux/MacOS release may also be on the cards). It's also likely that an announcement will be made imminently as the exclusivity window officially ends this Wednesday.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 launched to critical acclaim, marking a significant shift in perception toward developer Bloober Team, which had previously worked on more divisive titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/medium_-_cloud_version">The Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blair_witch">Blair Witch</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear</a>.</p>
<p>The studio has most recently launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on consoles and PC, with the Switch 2 version proving to be a solid option with stellar visuals and reasonable performance. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">7/10 review</a> highlighted it as a "celebration of survival horror", but noted that it did little that could be deemed truly original.</p>
<p>Bloober Team is now currently working once again with Konami on a remake of the original Silent Hill.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6436fa114057f"><a title="eShop Selects September 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6436fa114057f/eshop-selects-september-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Phew</em>. What a month, hey? It's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>, and it's a doozy.</p>
<p>As we approach the holiday season, we're practically drowning in games, with two of the biggest indies of the year hitting within weeks of each other. A <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct ensured</a> we'd be swimming in more titles for a while on both Switch 1 and 2. Who needs free time? Not us!</p>
<p>We have a lot to get through, so let's run over the rules: Nintendo Life writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop exclusives for the month (note that some of these <em>may</em> get physical releases in the future) from a list of games that we've reviewed. We then score those games, with 1s getting the most and 3 the least, tally up the numbers, which then determines the final top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nzhmyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>So, let's get to September's best eShop games then!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:188401,187767 @ 1759739539 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Now, there are two very big elephants in the room — and yes, you're probably wondering which one made number one. Note that a few games here are getting physicals later down the line, whether it be a late or limited release, but they're eligible for the vote here as they're not out yet.</p>
<p>But, for this month, there are some other lovely little gems that launched this month, around the same times as those behemoths. So, here they are — and for this month, all games that scored 7/10 and above were eligible.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">3rd Place - Earthion (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>Shmups are having a hell of a year, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> — from Ancient Corporation, Yuzo Koshiro, And Makoto Wada — might be at the top of the pile.</p>
<p>Keeping the gameplay simple by giving you just two weapon types to control, which can both be upgraded, Earthion lets everything shine. Form the level design to the chaotic waves of enemies to the boss encounters, this is a decently-challenging, extremely fun shmup.</p>
<p>It <em>finally</em> came to Switch in September 2025, and we gave it an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/earthion">excellent 8/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:187905 @ 1759738885 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Hades II (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so we all predicted this month's 1st and 2nd, right? Well, there was a <strong>single point</strong> separating these two games. There has to be a runner up, and this time, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games are complete wizards, and the team has managed to conjure up a superb sequel that builds upon the mechanical brilliance of the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>. Melinoë's fight against the Titan of Time is endlessly replayable, with new boons, new weapons, and a whole host of new characters and romance options. You'll want to kill time all the... time with this one.</p>
<p>Hades II easily deserved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">its 9/10 score</a>, <em>just</em> missing out because of its weaker story. In this humble writer's mind, anyway.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Potentially a controversial number one, given the chatter about difficulty and size, but there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was well worth the wait in our eyes.</p>
<p>Going above and beyond expectations, Hornet's adventure through Pharloom expands on Hollow Knight's toolset exponentially. A bigger map, even more equipables, different playstyles, tough enemies with patterns to learn, and healthy challenges. It's not going to be for everyone, but for those who can face up to the challenge, Silksong is marvellous. Play it at 120fps if you can on Switch 2; it's silky smooth.</p>
<p>It got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 10/10 from us</a>, <em>and</em> it's our eShop Selects winner of September 2025.</p>

</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-august-2025"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - August 2025</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-september-2025]]></content:encoded>
