<figure><a title="Dave the Diver - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88e03632c95f5/dave-the-diver-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Mintrocket has seemingly confirmed that a free upgrade is on the way "soon" for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This comes via a recently-posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">2nd anniversary video on YouTube</a> in which the developer responded to a comment from our very own community member 'PikaPhantom', simply stating "we will be providing free Switch 2 upgrade soon!".</p>
<p>We're not sure exactly what this might entail, but chances are it'll probably boost the game up to a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Dave the Diver - Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04de0553a9c54/dave-the-diver-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">Youtube - Mintrocket</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dave the Diver has proven to be a massive hit with fans, and its success has led to many collaborations with other indie titles and even a few so-called "AAA" games, too.</p>
<p>In our review, we awarded it a score of 9/10 and said "It's one of the few games to come out this year that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". Definitely one to keep an eye on if you've not played it yet, then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yhgktw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183377 @ 1751121778 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>With my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> P Switch journey complete, I'm excited to actually spend some time with the damn machine this weekend. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is still tickling me in a "I can't believe I'm actually playing this" kinda way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is... well, it's Wind Waker! <em>On the go</em>!</p>
<p>My big plan is to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> over the next couple of days, though. That DK Direct has left me with Power Moons on the mind, and crossing a few more off the seemingly never-ending list is my only course of action. What a game, eh?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still playing quite a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> at the moment, though I must say I’m quite tempted to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and check out the new additions to the game line-up.</p>
<p>I’ve been a bit manic with my Switch 2 games recently; jumping between a handful of them at frequent intervals out of an abundance of excitement. I’m conscious to just slow down for a little bit and focus on one thing at a time. Probably won’t happen, though.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. That's it. When I start it up, I'm physically unable to pull myself away for about two hours. It's a real problem, but the whole darn thing is just excellent all around. I'm going to hit the 100 hour mark on this loooong before the year is out...</p>
<p>Amazingly, I haven't actually tried out the GameCube NSO app yet, so I think a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> are on the docket for the weekend. But I can't leave my island alone for too long. I've got too many lives to level up.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Still making my way around TRON: Catalyst after some unexpected plot twists. But this week’s champion on the Switch eShop is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. Questionable choices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">generative AI usage</a> on the game’s fictional internet aside, this is one of the strongest entries in the whole franchise and while being a very “safe” remake, I quite welcome the upgraded PS1 visuals in glorious 16:9 screen ratio.</p><p>

On the Switch 2 front I got a few new bangers but am still too hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> and its latest free DLC update while carving my way into chapter 7 of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut. There was also a very nice update on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</a> that brings the new siege PVE game mode that will surely take a chunk of my weekend. Assuming I can safely ignore STEAM summer sales, that’s my weekend sorted.</p></div>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I'm off for holiday the next two weeks, so I'm planning on doing some serious damage to a few things, including my game collection. I'll be playing a whole lot of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a> on PS5, and the amazing <strong>Dune: The Awakening</strong> on PC, those are my main priorities, and if I don't do serious hours in them on my week off it's never happening. However, my beautiful Switch 2 is also gonna be getting plenty of action, fret not</p>
<p>My sons and I will be continuing to hoover up everything in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but I'm also making my way very steadily through the new and improved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, which I rushed through first time out. It's got me wanting to 100% this time, though. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civ 7</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> are all on my holiday hit-list.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and catch you all after a quick two-week power nap. Take care, pals!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend... I'm on a plane! Again! But that means that perhaps it's time to catch up on my backlog. Or... time to do research for my own project! Which means that my options are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which I'm using as inspiration for a game I'm making to learn programming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, which I know I'm going to love (as I've mentioned in at least one other WAYP)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, which I bought full price and then only played a couple of hours of</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, which I hear great things about</p>
<p>So many games! So little time. I haven't decided yet, which means I'll probably default to Fantasy Life... again...</p>

<h2>Fraser Gilbert, Pure Xbox Editor</h2>
<p>Hello from the world of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>! I haven't delved into the world of Switch 2 yet, but I'm excited about my latest purchase for the Switch 1 - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>! I managed to pick it up at a great price on Vinted, and as someone who tends to stay away from 2D Mario (but loves <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>), I'm curious to see how I get on it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (kinda addicted to the Koopathlon, not gonna lie), and I'm meaning to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a>. I had a great streak going on Ring Fit for weeks, but things got busy around the Xbox Showcase, and I ended up neglecting it. It's time to right that wrong!</p>

<p>The once-lost GBA chapter returns this Summer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another week of action-packed showcases and to top it off, WayFoward gave fans another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>A new trailer was shared during the 'IndiaMania 2025' showcase, with extended gameplay footage on display. It highlights how this modern version of the revived GBA project will include "more action, more environments, and more transformations" than before.</p>
<p>This "once-lost chapter" in the Shantae saga is scheduled to arrive in <strong>Summer 2025</strong> on the Switch and multiple other platforms. In some related news, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> title was recently made compatible with the Switch 2 thanks to a recent firmware system update.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bandai Namco remastered the PlayStation Vita exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_wars_remastered">Freedom Wars</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to give this action RPG a go since then, there's now a demo available on Nintendo's eShop. The full game is also currently on sale in the US for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong> instead of $39.99 USD.</p>
<p>In our review, we said this game was a welcome addition to the Switch library - reviving one of the PS Vita's most unique and enjoyable games, even if there were a few setbacks in terms of story and performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its core gameplay is challenging and satisfying in equal measure, with plenty of customisable options and upgrades to keep you hooked."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:176132 @ 1751122353 -->
<p>Since launch, the development team has also rolled out some updates for the game to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/freedom-wars-remastered-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">improve the overall experience</a>.

<p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lunar_remastered_collection">Lunar Remastered Collection</a> arrived on the Switch in April, it had a bit of a rocky physical launch. This return of the classic JRPG series also saw some cool goodies, but they weren't made available to the public.</p>
<p>Now, though, this has changed with GungHo Online Entertainment America announcing the Althena's Treasure Box will be made available in the US and Europe as a "limited-edition" release. This special collector's boxset includes "one-of-a-kind" items based on Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yhgktw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>
