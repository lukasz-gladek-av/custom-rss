<figure><a title="Mario - 40th" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10482f92e0b0f/mario-40th.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans have recently been pondering over a mysterious X/Twitter account that seemingly directly references Super Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-40th-anniversary-placeholder-twitter-account/">The Gamer</a>, X account <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">@supermario40th</a> has been causing a bit of a kerfuffle, with some suspecting that it might be legit, thus indicating that Nintendo will indeed celebrate the plumber's anniversary with a number of key announcements. At the moment, it's completely blank bar the handle, the 'aaaaaaaaa' name, and a single follow for <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo">Nintendo's Japanese account</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this even worth mentioning? Well, Nintendo's done it before, that's why. Its <a href="https://x.com/supermario35th">@supermario35th</a> account, which is still live at the time of writing, went through a very similar journey back in 2020 (it even had the same 'aaaaaaaaaaa' name, albeit with a couple more 'a's), and we covered it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/fans_have_discovered_a_private_mario_35th_anniversary_twitter_account">right here on Nintendo Life</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the potential issue we have is that the 40th anniversary account was seemingly created back in 2020. So what's going on? Well, either Nintendo itself created the account early to ensure nobody else nabbed it, or someone <em>did</em> nab it and is simply keeping it safe in the event Nintendo knocks on their door.</p>

<p>Nintendo held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk">35th anniversary Direct presentation</a> for Super Mario on 3rd September 2020. It seems unlikely that the company will stick to the <em>exact</em> same schedule for the 40th, but it might well be worth keeping an eye out for a potential announcement in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Attack Vector and Sleeper Case get a facelift</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Sleeper Case / Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/907ba70c1f128/genki-sleeper-case-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between Genki and Switch 2 might forever be defined by that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">pre-reveal CES showcase</a>, but the accessory manufacturer has produced a lot of gear for the new hybrid in the months since. While we have liked most of the Switch 2 accessories we've seen so far from the company, select items have not been without their issues, with early teething problems like tricky zippers and too-snug designs. Fortunately, the problematic products have now received an upgrade.</p>
<p>Genki has informed us that both the Attack Vector modular case and the Sleeper Case are now available without any of the issues that both came with at launch. Previously, several users reported that the Attack Vector was too tight in the Switch 2 Dock, making it difficult to play the console up on the big screen, while many found the Sleeper Case's zip to be too tough.</p>
<p>We similarly took issue with the Sleeper Case's zipper in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">our review</a>, and while we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">didn't have any docking issues with the Attack Vector</a>, it's still nice to hear that the accessory manufacturer is listening to its customers.</p>
<p>Both items are now available on the Genki website in their new and improved forms — the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">Attack Vector</a> will set you back <strong>£42/$49.99</strong>, while the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Sleeper Case</a> is listed for <strong>£36/$42.99</strong>. These two items accompany the rest of Genki's Switch 2 lineup, including screen protectors, a charging base and more.</p>

<p>Although these teething problems appear to be on the mend, Genki isn't out of the woods yet. Following the company's much-discussed CES presentation back in January (where Switch 2 prototypes were freely shown off, despite Nintendo not yet officially lifting the lid on the system), Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">opened a lawsuit</a> against the company, claiming that Genki "demoed and promoted unauthorized purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories".</p>
<p>Genki has since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">released a statement</a>, claiming that it is "taking [Nintendo's case] seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully," and promised that it will "share more when we can".</p>
