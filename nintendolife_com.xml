The Pokémon-branded theme park will be a permanent fixture in Yomiuriland in Tokyo's Tama Hills, and will be divided into two core areas: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you have limited mobility, then you might not be allowed into the Pokémon Forest area at all. Yes, as covered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-you-walk-up-110-steps-without-help-the-pokmon-theme-park-in-japan-has-some-strict-safety-rules-that-could-exclude-many-visitors">IGN</a>, the <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index">official PokéPark website</a> states that those "unable to climb 110 steps without assistance" will not be allowed to enter. In addition, the Japanese site states that those who require the use of a wheelchair will also be restricted. Understandably, the site clarifies that this is "to ensure visitor safety".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjqwrzk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, it's not entirely surprising given the nature of the attraction. The Pokémon Forest is described as a 500m long nature trail featuring steep hills, tunnels, and stairs, and the site even says that visitors should expect "grassy areas and uneven paths". Children under 5 will also not be allowed to take part, even if accompanied by an older guest. Inclement weather may also lead to the suspension of the attraction altogether.</p>

<p>Sedge Town, meanwhile, will offer up a whole bunch of additional attractions, including rides, stores, and Sedge Gym, where attendees can watch Pokémon stage shows. You'll also have a chance to connect with other 'Pokémon Trainers' at the Primarina Fountain.</p>
<p>So it sounds like there's at something for everyone at PokéPark Kanto, even if you won't be able to access the Pokémon Forest. Tickets will be available for Japanese residents from 21st November and issued via a lottery system.</p>

<p>Definitive?</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Aspyr surprised us all by shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop. The 2013 adventure game from Crystal Dynamics is back with a bang, and we've been checking it out so you can see what's in store on Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>In the above video, we've got a whopping 18 minutes of Switch 2 gameplay footage, showcasing the opening escape sequence, some woodland hunting and, of course, a spot of tomb raiding. There's a mixture of gameplay and cutscenes for you to feast your eyes on too, so don't worry about any surprises.</p>
<p>And for those wondering how things compare on Switch 2 between playing with a Pro Controller and Mouse Mode, we've split the video into two, right around the halfway mark, so you can easily compare the control methods.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks... fine. The visuals are a little lacking for a Switch 2 'Definitive Edition' release, but we have to remember that this one has also landed on Switch 1, which is potentially what the game was optimised for in the first place.</p>
<p>Either way, Tomb Raider 2013 is back, and we're pleased with the chance to play it on the go! We'll have our full review with you shortly, so keep an eye out to see what we make of Lara's latest (re)adventure.</p>
