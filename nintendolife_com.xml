<p>Nintendo recently updated its music app on mobile devices, and this week it has released a new update for its Switch Parental Controls app.</p>
<p>According to the patch notes, this bumps it up to <strong>Version 2.2.0</strong> and it comes with a handful of updates to improve the overall experience. One, in particular, improves the 'Play Activity' display. Here are the full patch notes (via the App Store):</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls - Version 2.2.0 (August, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The play activity display has been improved.</li>
<li>The "Parental Controls Tips" section has been added to the bottom of the alerts menu.</li>
<li>Other small improvements have also been made.</li>
</ul></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a major update in May, adding Switch 2 support to the system - including settings related to the GameChat feature, and various other extended features like the ability to extend daily play-time limits:</p>

<p>"The "Arcade Archives" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpieces that built a generation for video games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This game is priced at <strong>$14.99 USD</strong> on Switch, and costs <strong>$16.99 USD</strong> on the Switch 2 (or your regional equivalent). Once again, it's available today.</p>

<p>From the team behind Cruis'n Blast</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Arcade racing fans have another game to look forward to this year, with GameMill Entertainment announcing it will be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fast_and_furious_arcade_edition">Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</a></strong> to the Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>24th October, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/cruisn_blast">Cruis'n Blast</a> vibes from this one, that's because developer Raw Thrills was behind the original 2022 arcade cabinet release. Cradle Games (which helped out with the port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_arcade_wrath_of_the_mutants">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants</a>) is assisting with this latest home console release.</p>
<p>Here's a brief description about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Experience the thrill of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade in attract mode! This video showcases the high-speed action and immersive arcade gameplay that makes this racing game a must-play for arcade enthusiasts. Watch as we dive into the heart-pounding excitement of the Fast &amp; Furious Arcade, where players can race through iconic locations, drive powerful cars, and experience the ultimate arcade attraction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Raw Thrills released Cruis'n Blast on Switch in 2021, we called it a hugely entertaining arcade-style racer, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>
<p>Much like Cruis'n Blast, Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition also features licensed cars and includes all kinds of action-packed sequences. As noted in the press release and video above, racers can look forward to split-screen multiplayer as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hit the road in legendary cars including the Dodge Charger, Corvette Z06, Shelby GT500 KR, Ford GT, Bronco DR, Jeep Wrangler and more - plus customize your car with unique color schemes.</p>
<p>Race through each of the original arcade game’s tracks solo or in split-screen with a friend and discover destructible environments, branching paths, and sneaky shortcuts that can shake up any race and reward risk-takers. Take on thrilling challenges with high-stakes objectives like intercepting a missile in the Swiss Alps or grounding a plane in the heart of Hong Kong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press package also includes a look at a European physical Switch release. It mentions how this is a "download code only".</p>
