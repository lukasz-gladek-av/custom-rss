<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e7e20537869/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Please, angry mob, wait! It's true, I had never finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before this week, but that's not to say that I hadn't played it before. If you'll put your pitchforks and burning torches down for a moment, I promise, I can explain.</p>
<p>It was 2004 when I first came into contact with Super Mario Bros. I remember that because I had just received a Game Boy Advance for my birthday, and in a vague attempt to put me onto a "proper" game and dissuade me from my copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/spongebob_squarepants_movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> tie-in platformer, my dad bought me the SMB GBA re-release.</p>
<p>Now yes, the handheld's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/classic_nes_series_super_mario_bros">Classic NES Series</a> version might not have been the <em>ideal</em> way to experience it for the first time — the squashed image, poorly lit screen, dinky little speakers, etc. — but six-year-old Jim knew no better, so I showed willing and cracked on with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f94d0ac5ee8/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That first play <em>has</em> stayed in my head. My friend had the zoomed-in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/super_mario_bros_deluxe">Deluxe</a> version on her Game Boy Color, and I distinctly remember comparing notes about how far we had made it through each level. My first time sneaking under Bowser in World 1-4 and sending him into the lava below was a particular point of conversation at the school lunch table, and while I never made it all that far before hitting a 'Game Over', I still managed to get a good few Worlds under my belt. I must have been better at games back then than I am today.</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, I stopped. Perhaps it was my inability to make it through the later stages. Perhaps the 32-bit GBA's larger colour palette and sexy sprite potential made me turn my nose up at anything that felt distinctly 'old'. Perhaps my eye was swayed by another attractive tie-in banger, because who would choose a little-known, blocky curio when the solid-gold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/crazy_frog_racer">Crazy Frog Racer</a> is right there (this is a joke, please don't hurt me).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I moved on and never went back. It's not like Nintendo hasn't given me <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/whats-the-best-way-to-play-super-mario-bros-in-2024">ample opportunity to play it</a> on every single console released since, but, at the time, I was far more interested in what was <em>new</em> instead of what I had missed.</p>
<p>So, I never picked it up on a Virtual Console, I didn't have the money for one of those sexy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-a-gorgeous-object-that-leaves-you-wanting-more">Game &amp; Watches</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_nes_classic_mini_review">NES Classic Minis</a>, and you know I wasn't heading up to Argos to buy any of the 'remixed' versions on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nes_remix_pack">Wii U</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/ultimate_nes_remix">3DS</a>. As for Nintendo Switch Online... <em>yeahh</em>, I don't really have an excuse for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/284b7e2426461/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All this is to say that the best part of 22 years have passed since I first played SMB on my Game Boy Advance, and I still hadn't seen the fabled 8-4. Until this week.</p>
<p>Knowing that the 40th anniversary was right around the corner, I decided to buck up my ideas and finally fill in my biggest blind spot in gaming. I fired up NSO, started from the very beginning, and in just a couple of hours — made all the shorter by the blessing of Rewind — I finally made it to the very end.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly I stopped playing all those years ago, but if I had to guess, I'd say that everything from World 6 onwards felt new. This meant that I had never seen the monochrome 6-3, I had never dodged the flying Cheep Cheep bridge in 7-3 (although that feels like 2-3+, to be fair), and I had to actually work out the maze solutions in the final two castles.</p>
<p>It's got to be said — news flash! — it's a good game. There's a lot here that feels a bit outdated by today's standards (from a 40-year-old game? Never!), but on the whole, I was impressed by how <em>not</em>-outdated it felt.</p>
<p>Mario's jump always has been, and always will be, super satisfying. Lakitu is <em>still</em> an arsehole if you don't bop him on the head at early doors. And I wasn't anticipating quite so much of a difficulty spike at the end. I'm not going to say it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, but I'm once again grateful to the NSO gods for blessing us with the Rewind feature.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7707fe258163c/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After more retries than I care to admit, I ducked under Bowser's legs one last time and finally, <em>finally</em>, found Princess <del>Peach</del> Toadstool in the right castle. It was a good feeling, made all the sweeter by the sound of my previously revoked membership card to the Nintendo Fan Club dropping through my postbox.</p>
<p>And to think, it only took four decades of the game being on the market for me to finish it. Come back in 2036 to see me finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> (this is another joke, I promise).</p>

<figure><a title="Talking Flower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/09aa04867ecdb/talking-flower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo is really mixing it up nowadays with merchandise, and the next surprise product on the way is a talking flower. It's not just any talking flower though, it's the same one based on the character from the 2023 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros.

<p>If you were a fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/you-can-apparently-mute-the-talking-flowers-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">and admittedly not everyone was</a>, as of next spring (alongside the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Switch 2 Edition</a>, you'll apparently be able to own your very own physical version of this flower. Here's some insight from Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi about this new product:</p><div><figure data-videoid="MjdXHwRDqMw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3948b1wjqzsk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdXHwRDqMw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's that time of the week once again, and now that the Super Mario 40th anniversary plans have been fully unveiled via the latest Direct...well...we're maybe not gonna be diving into quite as much Mario as we had sorta hoped this weekend, as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy 1 and 2's</a> re-release and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> are a little ways off yet. But hey, we got more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> deets (and that's all this guy cares about right now)!</p>
<p>Yes, there was a big ol' Nintendo Direct yesterday and we got a ton of new info — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> has a release date! The new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> has a release date! We're getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon life sim</a>!</p>
<p>Besides the Direct, somebody out there is playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> (look, we've all got our crosses to bear), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> is the newest member of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">the Difficulty Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-every-exciting-new-game-from-the-acclaim-showcase">Acclaim held its own showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever it is you happen to be picking up to play this weekend, or if you're taking some time off from games to do there things (like dream about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>) make sure to let us know in the comments; for now, let's pass you over now to some of the Nintendo Life team as we detail what we're up to this weekend.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was all geared up and hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 1 and 2</a> announcement that we got, although I now have to wait (and they're really quite expensive), so cold water has been applied to those plans.</p>
<p>Now, instead, I'll defo be diving into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>, I'm excited for that, and I'll also take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, which I've been keen on since it first got announced a while back. I'm really hoping the talent at ProbablyMonsters delivers something special here! Oh, and my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> playthrough must low-key continue!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I recently got to Deepnest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Lovely place. Looking forward to exploring more there, definitely. Beyond that, I still haven't fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> continues to surprise/delight/astound.</p>
<p>And beyond <em>that</em>, Episode 9 of Robert Ashley's <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://alifewellwasted.com/" href="https://alifewellwasted.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Life Well Wasted</a> is sitting downloaded on my phone. It's been nearly three years since the last and, while I feel it deserves my undivided attention, listening in the kitchen while prepping something tasty sounds like a pretty perfect evening. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Y'know what, I might just play that newly-announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Bananza</a> DLC! It looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm on a bit of a <strong>Contra</strong> binge at the moment, so I'm playing a lot of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Anniversary Collection</a> on Switch. Those early entries really are peerless.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, same as last weekend, and every evening this week: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar.</a> What a game! Marvelous XSEED finally found the recipe for success!</p>
<p>It's packed with tiny, beautiful, entirely unnecessary details, like snow falling off trees when you run into them, lanterns and window shutters swaying in the wind, and animals that lie down to rest. I am so happy that this game exists, with this level of love and care put into it, and I hope that it's a sign of equally good Story of Seasons games to come!But also I will be on a plane next week, so I might need to pick a good Plane Game (again — I promise I don't usually travel this much. It's a family reunion! Blame them, not me.)</p>
<p>My personal game development projects right now are centering around MICROGAMES — fishing minigames, specifically, but more generally speaking, any tiny games-within-games that have compelling and moreish mechanics. I know that sounds like I should just play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare</a>, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I'm thinking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley's</a> fishing minigame, or (if anyone remembers it) the carpentry minigame in <strong>Puzzle Pirates</strong>. Recommendations absolutely encouraged! It's Research™!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Yes, I'm still playing Silksong. That's it. That's the tea.</p>
<p>My review is coming next week, but it's safe to say I <em>love</em> it. Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>

<p>Like other games, once linked, it will allow trainers to transfer Pokémon from the new game to the cloud service (and vice-versa). You'll be able to "bring select Pokémon from past games to Lumiose City.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> got some of the spotlight in the latest broadcast, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-kirby-amiibo-will-apparently-be-nintendos-most-expensive-amiibo-ever">and apart from those new amiibo</a>, it's also been revealed there will be <em>another</em> 'Direct' taking place in the future.</p>
<p>This "2nd presentation" will once again be hosted by the game's director Masahiro Sakurai. We don't know what specifically will be revealed in this next show just yet or when exactly it will be aired but it's "on the way". During this week's Nintendo Direct, it was mentioned how "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" would be shared in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai also acknowledged this announcement via social media (here's a rough translation via DeepL):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was introduced to [a] Direct within [a] Direct... I'll do it! It's not something I can make right away, but please be patient"</p>

<p>When we find out more about this upcoming Direct, we'll be sure to let you know. In the meantime, you can check out the previous Kirby Air Riders broadcast, which revealed the playable roster of racers, courses, items and power ups, multiplayer aspects and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced in the same Direct how its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app would be getting regular updates about Kirby Air Riders leading up to the title's release.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there'll be a few (paid) gates you'll need to pass through before you can even access this particular library. Not only will you need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (aka the premium-priced tier), but you'll also be "required" to fork out for an accessory.</p>
<p>Apart from this information during the broadcast, Nintendo has also made note of the requirement on its official website:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zpovtj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch and Virtual Boy (Cardboard Model) for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch are required to play the Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership required to access Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two headset options to choose from. If you don't want to pay <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) for the replica, there is the cheaper cardboard model, which will set you back <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>. Nintendo's website also notes how users will need to have a paid Switch Online membership to purchase these accessories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a mixed reaction online to this, with some Nintendo diehards welcoming the Virtual Boy's return with open arms, while others are venting frustration about the price, the requirements to access it, and how there's still no option or proper workaround to officially experience these games <em>without</em> a headset.</p>
<p>Once again, this library will launch on 17th February 2026, with both accessories due out on the same date. You can see the games on the way to this particular digital library in our previous story:</p>

<p>Apart from the cost of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> pack, one other talking point following the latest Direct is the pricing of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> amiibo.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/kirby-air-riders-amiibo-price/">highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, these new figures will reportedly be Nintendo's "most expensive amiibo ever". To reiterate, it means fans will apparently have to fork out more than they've ever previously had to for first-party amiibo. One difference compared to your regular amiibo is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">swappable base</a>.</p>
<p>A single Kirby Air Riders figure will set you back $50 USD, or if you want to pick up both the Kirby and Waddle Dee figures, you'll be looking at a total cost of $100! Retailer listings with these same prices attached have already gone live in the US, and we'll be on the lookout for prices in other regions as they pop up.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo also noted during the Direct how it would have "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" to share in the future.</p>
<p>The same broadcast this week confirmed new amiibo for the Super Mario Galaxy bundle as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>. Fortunately, the amiibo for these games are slightly <em>less</em> expensive. Samus and her new bike is priced at $40, while standalone versions of Samus and Slyux are $30 each. As for the Galaxy amiibo (Mario &amp; Rosalina), they'll be $40 each.</p>

<p>In case you missed it during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> announcement, Rosalina's Storybook will be getting a physical release.</p>
<p>This product is based on the same storybook featured in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and will be available via the My Nintendo Store website. The US store has now confirmed it will be priced at $24.99 (or your regional equivalent) and arrives later this year on 25th November 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo has teamed up with Dark Horse Books to release this "beautiful hardcover volume". It's worth noting that the new pages featured in the upcoming releases <em>won't</em> be included in the physical print. Here's the official fine print about this from the latest Direct broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rosalina's Storybook does not include newly added pages from the Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the official description, along with another look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl who spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child, Luma.</p>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.</p>
<p>Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present Rosalina’s Storybook —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>

<p>A new paid DLC update is now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest Direct broadcast was filled with all sorts of surprises, but one thing you might not have expected was DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, just months after the game's initial release on the Switch 2, DK's latest outing has now been bolstered with some smashing new content, and it's available right now. As part of the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a>, Nintendo has also bumped the base game up to Version 2.0.0.</p>
<p>We've got the full patch notes here, which go into a little more detail about the changes. This is the second update for the title, which also makes "several other changes" to improve the overall gameplay experience. Here's the rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.0.0 (Released September 12, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the paid DLC DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush.
<ul>
<li>If you have not cleared the main game yet, you can go to DK Island by talking to Squawks at the Racing Layer.</li>
<li>If you have cleared the main game, you can go to DK Island by striking the Warp Gong after hearing about the “Bananza Rehearsal” from the Elder.</li>
<li>After reaching DK Island, you can play Emerald Rush by talking to Void Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of Banandium Chips that can be stored has been increased from 9,999 to 99,999.</li>
<li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned, even if you haven't cleared the "main game" just yet, you can still go to this island by interacting with Squawks on the Racing Layer. Of course, it's paid content, so you'll need to fork out $19.99 / £16.99 (or your regional equivalent) before you can access it.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also got an official page on its website, explaining in more detail how to experience the new DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza if you're having trouble accessing it. Here it is in full:</p>
<h3>Unable to Access DLC (Donkey Kong Bananza)</h3>
<p>Follow these steps if you purchased the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza, but the additional content is not appearing in-game.</p>
<p><strong>Before you start</strong></p>
<p>You must make a certain amount of progress in the game before the DLC can be accessed.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not cleared the main game yet, you can go to DK Island by talking to Squawks at the Racing Layer.</li>
<li>If you have cleared the main game, you can go to DK Island by striking the Warp Gong after hearing about the "Bananza Rehearsal" from the Elder.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching DK Island, you can play Emerald Rush by talking to Void Kong.</p>

<p>And if you are still unsure about this game, there's now a Switch 2 demo you can download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>
