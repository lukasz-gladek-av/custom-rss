<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="5b70fc2c352b4"><a title="PS5 / Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b70fc2c352b4/ps5-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping an eye on our weekly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/japanese-charts-dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-remake-shoves-pokemon-off-the-podium">Japanese Charts</a>, then you'll know that the Switch and Switch 2 have been consistently dominating the hardware space, with Sony's PS5 struggling to get a foothold in the region (and let's not even mention Xbox).</p>
<p>That's not to say it hasn't doesn't well, mind you, with the console surpassing a total of 7 million units across the Base model, Digital Edition, and Pro. But with the Switch 2 already well on its way to 3 million sales just five months after its launch, you can bet the higher-ups at Sony will be quaking in their shiny loafers.</p>
<p>So, as announced during the recent State of Play, a new region-locked PS5 Digital Edition will launch in Japan at 55,000 yen (approx $350), making it comfortably the cheapest console from Sony's lineup. By comparison, the regular Digital Edition is significantly more expensive at 72,980 yen (approx $473).</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds familiar, then it should, because Nintendo chose to go down the same route when it launched the Switch 2 back in June, offering a region-locked console for just 49,980 yen (approx $322). This proved to be a wise decision, with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/switch-2s-cheaper-region-locked-version-is-overwhelmingly-popular-among-japans-2-2-million-pre-order-applicants-survey-suggests/">data from initial lottery pre-orders</a> indicating that 69.7% of applicants opted for the region-locked console with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. A further 27.5% chose the region-locked console on its own, while only 2.9% went for the multi-language model.</p>
<p>So it seems safe to assume, then, that if it weren't for the cheaper region-locked Switch 2, the new console might not be enjoying such a strong start in Japan. Now that Sony is opting for the same approach, it seems like the company is getting increasingly desperate to close the gap before the Switch 2 completely crushes its competition.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that for both companies, the yen is still pretty weak in Japan right now. It's been on an accelerating decline for a while, sinking to values not seen since the '90s. So it's no surprise to see Nintendo and Sony taking some pretty drastic steps in the region to shift product.</p>
<p>That said, the PS5 has proved to be a pretty major success worldwide, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ps5-sales-now-top-84-2-million-units-well-on-way-to-100-million-milestone">selling over 84.2 million units since its launch in 2020</a>. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">recently surpassed 10 million units worldwide</a>, with Nintendo forecasting a total of 19 million for the current financial year.</p>

<p>Pre-orders opening soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After cropping up back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> made another haunting appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play</a> showcase, and what do you know, it got a release date this time.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that the next spooky remake will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>12th March 2026</strong>. Pre-orders open today on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series, though Koei Tecmo states that we Switch 2 fans will have to wait until "a later date" to bagsy our copies.</p>
<p>As the latest trailer showcases, the remake has seen a pretty substantial upgrade in the visual and sound departments, with Minakami Village and its wraiths packing an extra level of creepy detail. There are also some new features this time, including focus, zoom and filters for your Camera Obscura, and the ability to hold Mayu's hand for a much-needed health and spirit boost.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, the game's <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/specs/">official website</a> states that the Switch 2 version will run at 1080p / 30fps, with no support for HDR. That said, there is the option to move the Camera Obscura with gyro aiming in handheld mode, so that's something.</p>
<p>The game will soon be available to pre-order in both its standard and 'Digital Deluxe' forms — the latter of which throws in a digital soundtrack, digital artbook and a handful of bonus costumes for Mio and Mayu.</p>

<p>Previous issues have been resolved</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this year, a few months after the Switch 2 launch, Nintendo identified an issue with the Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> on the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Now, according to Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">Switch 2 compatibility search page</a>, the same title has received an update yesterday on <strong>11th November 2025</strong>. According to the note attached, previously identified issues have been fixed.</p>
<h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>Supported - Game behaviour is consistent with Nintendo Switch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Update 11/11/2025</em></li>
<li><em>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The page doesn't share any specific information, but as previously reported there was an issue where the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-identifies-xenoblade-chronicles-x-voice-sync-bug-on-switch-2">voices were out of sync in some areas</a> of the title. With the game behaviour now "consistent", the Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X should work just fine on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since the new system's launch in June, Nintendo has also released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, which made several adjustments to improve the overall gameplay on the new platform. There's currently been no mention of upgrades for the Xenoblade games, but there were some reports earlier this year of a supposed "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jfoucs/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition_games/">hidden 60fps mode</a>" for the Definitive Edition of X. If we hear anything, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>This compatibility update follows on from Nintendo's release of new firmware for the Switch 2 yesterday, bumping the system up to Version 21.0.0. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">our previous coverage here</a> on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Get ready for an even bigger launch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During PlayStation's '<a href="https://youtu.be/DJp8K40TSxc?t=563">State of Play</a>' broadcast this week, Koei Tecmo and Omega Force issued a reminder about the "major DLC" on the way to the 1 vs. 1,000 musuo early next year.</p>
<p>The <strong>Visions of the Four Heroes</strong> will add new stories and weapons when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$34.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and pre-orders are now live on select platforms. This date lines up with the base game's launch on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's some additional details, and you can check out the latest overview trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visions of Four Heroes features brand-new stories centered around four heroes whose stories were not explored in <em>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS:</em> Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao and Lu Bu. These stories are explored as “What If” scenarios and will allow players to discover new sides to these legendary heroes. New companions are also featured in the major DLC including Zhuhe, a Guardian of Peace; Diaochan, a beautiful warrior and a familiar fan favorite; and a mysterious new officer who will be revealed as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>"Fans will also be able to enjoy new weapons – the “Bow” and “Rope Dart” – to further enhance the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 warfare by leveraging each weapon’s unique characteristics on the battlefield. Existing weapons will also receive an update, granting new arts, skill panels, as well as an increase in the trait level cap. Finally, a new “Training Ground” mode will be included, where players battle formidable foes while practicing their skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you pre-order the DLC, for a "limited time" you will also receive an exclusive outfit for the protagonist (the "Yellow Turban Attire"). Below is some more information about this. There'll also be an early purchase bonus and a digital pre-order bonus for Switch 2 players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Designed to embody the heroic spirit of DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, this costume lets players take to the battlefield clad in the symbolic garb of the Yellow Turban Rebellion."</p>
