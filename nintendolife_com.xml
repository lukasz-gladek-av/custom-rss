<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ff4336e3766eb/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been on the circuit for over a month now, and after a decade of its predecessor, it's great to be playing something that feels fresh.</p>
<p>That's not to say all of its innovations have gone down well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">a vocal contingent of players</a> taking against Nintendo's updates and approach to Grand Prix mode, with the 'intermission' routes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fans-reckon-nintendo-has-killed-mario-kart-world-with-its-latest-update">drawing particular ire</a> from people who prefer the traditional three-lap race-around-a-circuit.</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-mario-kart-world-speeds-past-1-million-physical-sales">the sales numbers</a>, it's safe to say that Nintendo will be supporting this one for a while. And given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">the furore</a> around its eyewatering $80 price tag, we don't imagine there'll be paid DLC coming for a long while. We <em>do</em> imagine free updates that include not just minor tweaks but perhaps additional features, modes, costumes, and maybe even new characters.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's at the top of Team NL's wishlist...</p>
<h2>Waypoint the way - Ollie Reynolds, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dae5c4f66fc5d/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the recent controversy around the apparent lack of traditional three-lap races, I think it's only sensible that Nintendo introduces a bit more customisation when it comes to choosing <em>how</em> we race. So yes, let's see <strong>a 'Classic Grand Prix' mode</strong> that just allows us to jump from one track to the next for those familiar, comforting three-lap bouts.</p>
<p>Don't stop there, though. Why not let us completely <strong>customise our own Knockout race</strong> by choosing any four tracks from the map? It could make for some truly unique races! If that's not enough, I think it would be neat if you could select your own start and end waypoints from any point on the map, incorporating any track that happens to fall in between.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mario Kart World holds massive potential that, at the moment, I feel is being held back somewhat. Nintendo needs to unshackle World from its Chain Chomp.</p>
<h2>Put a pin in it - Alana Hagues, deputy editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9ce7476c08057/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've avidly read everything Mario Kart World on Nintendo Life, you probably know Jim and I have been responsible for putting most of the guides together. So, um, it won't surprise you all that I really, <em>really</em> could've done with a map marker, Nintendo.</p>
<p><strong>A mix of ways to track your collectibles or mark a location on the map</strong> would've been a godsend, but it also would've allowed me to remember places that are perfect for snapping photos or messing around with friends. I admittedly love stumbling across things on the map, but there were times when I was trying to do something else, like chase a Nabbit or attempt a P Switch.</p>
<p>On that subject, if you're going to give us stickers, <strong>let us put more than one sticker on our vehicles</strong>. What's the point in a cute little reward if they're barely noticeable?</p>
<p>Lastly, for something a bit more left-field (and to echo Ollie), how about a design-your-own Knockout Tour? I am thinking <em>waaaay</em> out of the box here, I know, but imagine how cool it would be to actually choose your routes between courses.</p>

<h2>You've got a friend in me - Jim Norman, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb74cf558f98a/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have been thoroughly enjoying MKW. My friends have also been enjoying it, from what I understand. So why, oh why, can it sometimes feel like such a headache trying to play <em>with</em> them?</p>
<p><strong>Local multiplayer Free Roam</strong> feels like the lowest-hanging fruit here (it sure would have made finding all those P Switches a lot easier), and while there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-play-free-roam#can-i-play-free-roam-in-split-screen"><em>some</em> semblance of a workaround</a>, it ain't the full-fat experience I'm after.</p>
<p>Even if Free Roam is off the table, can we at least have it so I can <strong>add friends to pre-existing online lobbies</strong>? If I'm playing with one group and then the lovely Felix-from-Nintendo-Life-here pops up online, there's currently no way for me to add him to my lobby so we can all play together. Oh no. Instead, I've got to clear everyone out and start all over again with a fresh room. God forbid I do all of that only for Zion-from-Nintendo-Life-here to come online after a race or two...</p>
<p>I'll be willing to forget all of the above, however, if my beloved <strong>Koopalings</strong> were to rejoin the roster. I miss Roy.</p>
<h2>New Kids on the (?) Block - Gavin Lane, editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b3019592fb10d/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Jim has brought up the roster, <strong>Kid Pauline</strong> from the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">DK Bananza</a> feels like a no-brainer addition to the roster. Both DK and his muse are light in the costume department, too, and given the multitude of unlockable get-ups in Bananza, slipping <strong>more outfits</strong> (and therefore more food?) into MKW makes eminent sense. Who <em>doesn't</em> want Vegas Jumpsuit Waluigi?</p>
<p>Back on the subject of DKB, after reading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">the preview coverage</a> and considering potential lore implications of a teenage Pauline on the hallowed and very much canonical Mario/DK timeline (you just know Nintendo's got a doc somewhere), it's got me thinking about <strong>teenage versions of other Mushroom Kingdom residents</strong>. We've had the babies, now it's time for the t(w)eens. Yes, you heard it here first: this is the <em>real</em> reason Nintendo gave <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-charles-martinet-made-gamings-greatest-accident-a-real-character">Charles Martinet</a> his P45. He just wasn't quite able to nail Squeaky-Voiced Teen Mario.</p>
<p>Am I 100% serious? Perhaps 50%, but I <em>would</em> enjoy seeing what Nintendo's artists did with a 'Waluigi-but-a-teenager' brief. If they're scraping the Mushroom Kingdom barrel (hey, I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-all-characters#top-30">Conkdor</a> as much as the next man, but c'mon!) and they're holding back the Links and Inklings and wider Nintendo universe characters for some reason, sure, give me Peach with a pimple. Give me edgy, emo Toad. Show me Wario before he went off the rails.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b2b6c067ad885/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>C'mon, don't you want to see an official, safe-for-work teenage Bowser? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and <strong>200cc</strong>, I suppose. Preferably with an obscure unlock method involving rune symbols drawn in Mouse Mode and getting three-star golds in every online Knockout Tour by reversing over each checkpoint line.</p>

<figure><a title="Miyamoto - Super Nintendo World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca4def15ef96e/miyamoto-super-nintendo-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>During Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">shareholder Q&amp;A meeting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto stressed the importance for developers to "work for the consumer, not your boss", ensuring that teams can produce games that will satisfy players.</p>
<p>Afterwards, ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura added his own two cents to the conversation and stated that Miyamoto has always viewed games as "products", not "works of art", and believes that his background studying industrial art helped shaped this viewpoint (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shigeru-miyamotos-background-in-industrial-design-explains-his-pragmatic-product-not-art-approach-to-making-games-nintendo-veteran-says/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Miyamoto studied industrial design at an art university, and he views games as ‘products,’ not ‘works of art.’ I think this perspective is what leads to game development that’s more aligned with the user.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's not clear from the quote, Imamura doesn't believe Miyamoto's view of games to be a negative one. Instead, it helps to ensure that game development is done in service of the player, ensuring that the final product is one of exceptional high quality.</p>
<p>The discussion over whether game development can be viewed as an art form has been ongoing for many years, and we believe that yes, it absolutely <em>is</em> an art form. But it's one that customers are ultimately paying good money to experience, and we don't necessarily believe it's wrong, therefore, to also view them as products.</p>
<p>Hey, if it helps make sure they're consistently great, then we're all for it.</p>

<figure><a title="Popplio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2867edeea91/popplio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day that you get to meet The Pope, but one Pokémon fan decided to make the most of his recent trip to The Vatican on 5th July.</p>
<p>Reddit user ReptileCake took two Pokémon cards with him when meeting Pope Leo (real name Robert Francis Prevost): one to get blessed, and one to get signed. But why? Why Pokémon cards, specifically? Well, the Pokémon in question is Popplio!</p>
<p>Get it..? Popplio. Pope Leo. Guffaw!</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkzywlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>

<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>
