<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c31be0e4dd2d4/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 brought with it something we'd dreamt about on the original Switch: GameCube games on NSO.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">the new GC controller</a> giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> that authentic feeling (while also adding wireless without a WaveBird and sneaking in some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-gyro-and-a-better-d-pad">gyro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-using-a-gamecube-controller-with-the-nso-app-yields-fun-surprises">other neat features</a>, too), we've been having a great time with the four available games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation-apparently-has-underlying-issues-nintendo-desperately-needs-to-fix">Some emulation teething issues</a> aside, we haven't run into anything like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/10/nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-games-need-some-work">the problems of the N64 app at launch</a>, and we're dead excited for the upcoming lineup. Have you seen the secondhand price of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> these days!?</p>
<p>However, with the Switch 1 libraries we've accumulated over eight years, plus the larger sizes of Switch 2 games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is 59.4GB, for instance) and a paucity of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">'proper' physical game card releases</a>, storage space is at a premium - even if you've added more to the internal 256GB with a micro SD Express card.</p>
<p>Even with a pricey 1TB card, though, I couldn't get all my games on the system. Having to pick and choose what I take with me is a necessity now. Now, compared to a monster like Cyberpunk (or the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>, which will apparently weigh in at 73.2GB), the 6GB that the GameCube app currently asks for is small potatoes. The addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> this week bumped the overall download up from 5.1GB, so the situation isn't dire just yet.</p>
<p>The GameCube's cute little discs could hold nearly 1.5GB of data, so even accounting for any jiggery-pokery from Nintendo or repackaging of the ROMs, individual games aren't likely to be larger than that (most, like Strikers, will be much smaller).</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd8c962d75bb5/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some games came on two discs, of course, though I'd say the chances of seeing this one on NSO are slim — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But on a handheld console where every gigabyte counts, the option to pick and choose the ISOs we want to take with us would be appreciated. As the library grows (it's currently at four, with six further games announced), so too will that app. And while the quality of the games so far is impressive, as with the other NSO retro apps, there are some games that you're just not going to play, for whatever reason. When the entire Game Boy offering takes up just 134MB, that's fine, but we could be saving valuable gigabytes with these GameCube games.</p>
<p>There's something to be said for having the entire library with you. There's always a chance you might discover a game you wouldn't have given the time of day otherwise, and having instant access to the lot <em>is</em> fantastic. But when my menu screen is filled with download bars flashing a little 'X' in the middle, something's got to give. It ain't gonna be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but the memory cost of having that with me at all times is going to increase every month.</p>
<p>And if we dare to dream that Wii games might one day get their own Nintendo Classics app, the sizes are only going to get bigger. Whether there's a genuine chance of Wii games ever coming to Switch 2 is a topic for another day, but the fact is that some of us would love to have a little more control over exactly what's on our systems.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you like to be able to leave Wind Waker on the virtual shelf to make space for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wave_race_blue_storm">Wave Race</a> (which surely must be coming, right?!)? Download an <em>extra</em> copy of F-Zero, perhaps - just in case? Let's get a handle on it in the poll below.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54e84460ce293/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the addition of a fan in the Switch 2's dock, we all knew that Nintendo's new console would probably kick out a bit more heat than its predecessor in order to manage the more technically demanding games.</p>
<p>According to some folks in Japan, however (thanks, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/">Nintendo Soup</a>), their consoles are actually overheating. Multiple users have taken to X to relay instances in which their games have crashed, the consoles' fans have gone into overdrive, or, in one case, their system simply became too hot to hold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmoxp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://x.com/x1010_q" tabindex="-1">@x1010_q</a> stated (via machine translation) "Switch 2 overheating. Too intense, I couldn’t even hold the console. Without a fan, you can’t play for long". Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/JPSjxSmUMy170" tabindex="-1">@JPSjxSmUMy170</a> simply said "Switch 2 is overheating; the fan noise is annoying".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether the Switch 2 consoles are definitely, irrefutably overheating in these cases, however. As demonstrated with <a href="https://x.com/p_typhoon" tabindex="-1">@p_typhoon</a>'s tweet below, they merely mention that "The fan's going nuts" after an instance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> crashing, but we can't say for sure that this is the root cause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First freeze on Switch 2.<br>
Talked to an old man in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it froze.<br>
The screen's still moving (background grass swaying in the wind), but I can't control anything.<br>
The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating.<br>
Auto-save saved my butt...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind the environmental conditions in which the Switch 2 is being played. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68567/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-dock-becomes-hot-and-stops-outputting-to-tv-or-charging">Nintendo itself advises</a> that users should "not place the console near a heat source, or in a location where heat can easily build up", while also ensuring that "the air vent on the dock is not covered or obstructed".</p>
<p>So this is clearly a <em>potential</em> issue that Nintendo is very much aware of. We can certainly attest to the console getting rather warm after a certain amount of time but – touch wood – we've not yet had any instances of the Switch 2 overheating.</p>
