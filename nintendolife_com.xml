<p>Compatible with Switch 1 and Switch 2, it looks pretty familiar to the Pro 2 – why fix what isn't broken 'n' all that – but comes with a wealth of features that will hopefully justify the $69.99 price tag.</p>
<p>First up, we've got swappable ABXY buttons, so if you're keen to remap inputs for certain titles, then this should prove pretty useful. The Pro 3 also comes with its own charging dock, TMR analogue sticks, L4 and R4 bumpers, two back paddles, rumble support, gyro support, and hall effect triggers. Wowza!</p>
<p>It's currently available for pre-order via the official website and Amazon, with shipping estimated to begin on <strong>12th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a look at all features for the Pro 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TMR Joystick<br>
- Extra bumpers (R4 and L4)<br>
- 2 Pro back paddle buttons<br>
- Trigger mode switch<br>
- Hall effect triggers<br>
- Tactile D-pad<br>
- Swappable magnetic ABXY buttons<br>
- 6-axis motion control (for Switch and Steam only)<br>
- Turbo function<br>
- Vibration<br>
- Support 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2</p>
