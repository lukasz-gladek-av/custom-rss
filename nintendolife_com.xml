<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-yoshi-touch-and-go">Last week</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for everyone's favourite dino, as we looked at a duo of designs for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a>. There's no polite way to put this: it was a blowout. The colourful North American and European design walked away with a staggering win, taking 83% of the vote and leaving the simplistic Japanese variant with the remaining 17%. <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>This time, hot off the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">The New World of Steam</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-has-been-delayed-until-2026">delay</a>, we're taking a look at the <em>last</em> Layton game to see the light of day: the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy - Deluxe Edition</a>. It's not the greatest Layton mystery by a long shot, but if we had known how long it would be until we got another series entry, perhaps we would have looked at it a little more fondly.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ohyrkn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, let's do exactly that today, shall we? There are two covers to choose from this time, in a classic duel between East and West. So, let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:93248 @ 1759053603 -->
<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="809205d30a0c4"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - EU/NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/809205d30a0c4/laytons-mystery-journey-euna.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western box art borrows a lot from the DS/3DS Layton games, as far as formatting is concerned. Our titular hero stands centre stage, looking puzzled, while several of the in-game head-scratchers float around her. The brown background and frankly unruly title don't do much to draw the eye, but you've got to respect a bit of design cohesion — even if it's not quite as dramatic as some of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/poll-box-art-brawl-professor-layton-and-the-curious-village">earlier series entries</a>.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="38648b0f9c5d1"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38648b0f9c5d1/laytons-mystery-journey-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is a swing in a different direction! Instead of following the puzzle focus of the West, the Japanese design instead puts its main ensemble front and centre. We like the dramatic poses that everyone seems to be striking, and Sherl slotting in around the corner logo is a nice touch.</p>
<p>There's not nearly enough top hats on display, though. Shame...</p>

<p>Here's everything announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Mojang aired its second major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Live broadcast of 2025 this weekend, and it was once again packed with all sorts of announcements and reveals. If you didn't catch it, here's the full rundown:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="new-drop-the-copper-age-out-30th-september-2025">New Drop - The Copper Age (Out 30th September 2025)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have already been testing features of this drop that changes up early-game tool and weapon progression, introduces the copper golem, shows off powered shelves (including the cheeky ways you’ve been using them), and more!</p>
<p>Even more exciting, you’ll be playing this game drop in just a few days. The Copper Age releases on September 30th. Prepare to download!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184677 @ 1759054966 -->
<h3 id="happy-ghast-music-video">Happy Ghast - Music Video</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our last drop, Chase the Skies, brought loads of great features to Minecraft and the happy ghast continues to be a community favorite. We created a short video to celebrate just how adorable it really is."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dragon-ball-z-dlc-is-coming-soon-to-minecraft">Dragon Ball Z DLC is "coming soon" to Minecraft</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cd0e1f120db7d"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd0e1f120db7d/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll be powering up Kamehamehas and throwing down Spirit Bombs in this new DLC – all about Dragon Ball Z! It will be releasing later this year, though a free Super Saiyan hair character creator item is available to download right now! This DLC has everything you can imagine (so long as you’re thinking about Dragon Ball-Z stuff) so check back soon for more details and have your Dragon Ball wish granted!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-underwater-mob-the-nautilus">New Underwater Mob - The Nautilus</h3>
<figure data-uuid="9a899ebbb2f8a"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a899ebbb2f8a/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The Nautilus (part of the "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" drop coming later this year) is the new underwater mob and makes it easier to build underwater. You can also tame it, ride it, and equip it with armour. Additionally, there's Zombie Nautilus with Drowned riding the new mob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We introduce the nautilus, a rideable underwater mob that will have you exploring the depths like never before! You can even build from it, like our old friend the happy ghast, and deck it out in colorful armor. Deep sea exploration is still dangerous, but the new “Breath of the Nautilus” effect (which pauses your breath meter), as well as your increased maneuverability, will make things a bit less daunting."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-weapon-the-spear">New Weapon - The Spear</h3>

<p>Another "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" update will add spear and Zombie Horses (with spears). Here's a bit more about this new weapon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spear – our first tiered weapon in quite some time. “Tiered” means you can craft it out of different materials, and each one will act in a slightly different way...You can jab with it or use the charge attack. But watch your timing - hold the charge attack for too long and your attacks will lose attributes and effectiveness. Just as exciting is the way that the spear’s damage is affected by your movement speed. Go faster (for example on a mount) and you’ll hit even harder!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mojang also released an after-show video, showing off a bunch of new features from both The Copper Age and Mounts of Mayhem updates:</p>

<p>60fps was an option, but the priority was stability</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Koei Tecmo and developer Omega Force have confirmed the upcoming Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> will run at a fixed but "stable" 30fps.</p>
<p>The game's director Tomohiko Sho shared this information with Famitsu this week, while explaining the reasoning behind this decision. The team could have hit 60fps, but there would have been a reduced number of soldiers, and the priority was to provide a stable experience.</p>
<p>Here's the translation (via RPG Site):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 version will be fixed to 30 fps, and we are developing it with a priority on stable operations. It's good hardware, and if we reduced the number of soldiers to about the same amount as prior Warriors series entries, we could have gotten it running at 60 fps. Since this game will show a few thousands of characters, I think it would be better if you can play here with a stable 30 fps."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If we hear any developments or updates about the performance of this title on the Switch 2 ahead of its January 2026 launch, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>This follows Koei Tecmo announcing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</a> for the Switch 2 and Switch earlier this week. It will be coming to both platforms in March 2026.</p>
