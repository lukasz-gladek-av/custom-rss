<p>But the Switch experience is reportedly "worse"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0927536caea58/everybodys-golf-hot-shots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> can be a fun experience on Switch, but there are admittedly certain areas of its game that could be improved (like performance). Fortunately, developer Hyde and Bandai Namco seem to already be addressing some problems.</p>
<p>As highlighted by the <a href="https://youtu.be/z93sHPDsli0">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JonComms">former Nintendo Life video presenter Jon Cartwright</a>, this title has received a new patch since its release last week, bumping it up to Version 1.1.1. It apparently uncaps the frame rate on both the Switch and Switch 2 (it was previously fixed at 30fps across both systems).</p>
<p>According to the results so far, it's said to have enhanced the performance of the game on Switch 2, enabling the title to now hit 60fps "most of the time" but some weather effects might impact this.</p>
<p>The downside of this? The game experience on the original Switch hardware is now supposedly "worse". As the frame rate is unlocked (and there are no frame rate toggle options), it's now running at "around 35fps" on this platform, but this results in "a very inconsistent timing frame" when taking a swing, compared to when the game was capped at 30fps.</p>

<p>This patch for Everybody's Golf also happens to follow a recent 60fps performance update for the Clap Hanz title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_come_easy_golf">Easy Come Easy Golf</a>. If the official patch notes for this latest Hot Shots update are shared online, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e7e20537869/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Please, angry mob, wait! It's true, I had never finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before this week, but that's not to say that I hadn't played it before. If you'll put your pitchforks and burning torches down for a moment, I promise, I can explain.</p>
<p>It was 2004 when I first came into contact with Super Mario Bros. I remember that because I had just received a Game Boy Advance for my birthday, and in a vague attempt to put me onto a "proper" game and dissuade me from my copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/spongebob_squarepants_movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> tie-in platformer, my dad bought me the SMB GBA re-release.</p>
<p>Now yes, the handheld's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/classic_nes_series_super_mario_bros">Classic NES Series</a> version might not have been the <em>ideal</em> way to experience it for the first time — the squashed image, poorly lit screen, dinky little speakers, etc. — but six-year-old Jim knew no better, so I showed willing and cracked on with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f94d0ac5ee8/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That first play <em>has</em> stayed in my head. My friend had the zoomed-in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/super_mario_bros_deluxe">Deluxe</a> version on her Game Boy Color, and I distinctly remember comparing notes about how far we had made it through each level. My first time sneaking under Bowser in World 1-4 and sending him into the lava below was a particular point of conversation at the school lunch table, and while I never made it all that far before hitting a 'Game Over', I still managed to get a good few Worlds under my belt. I must have been better at games back then than I am today.</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, I stopped. Perhaps it was my inability to make it through the later stages. Perhaps the 32-bit GBA's larger colour palette and sexy sprite potential made me turn my nose up at anything that felt distinctly 'old'. Perhaps my eye was swayed by another attractive tie-in banger, because who would choose a little-known, blocky curio when the solid-gold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/crazy_frog_racer">Crazy Frog Racer</a> is right there (this is a joke, please don't hurt me).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I moved on and never went back. It's not like Nintendo hasn't given me <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/whats-the-best-way-to-play-super-mario-bros-in-2024">ample opportunity to play it</a> on every single console released since, but, at the time, I was far more interested in what was <em>new</em> instead of what I had missed.</p>
<p>So, I never picked it up on a Virtual Console, I didn't have the money for one of those sexy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-a-gorgeous-object-that-leaves-you-wanting-more">Game &amp; Watches</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_nes_classic_mini_review">NES Classic Minis</a>, and you know I wasn't heading up to Argos to buy any of the 'remixed' versions on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nes_remix_pack">Wii U</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/ultimate_nes_remix">3DS</a>. As for Nintendo Switch Online... <em>yeahh</em>, I don't really have an excuse for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/284b7e2426461/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All this is to say that the best part of 22 years have passed since I first played SMB on my Game Boy Advance, and I still hadn't seen the fabled 8-4. Until this week.</p>
<p>Knowing that the 40th anniversary was right around the corner, I decided to buck up my ideas and finally fill in my biggest blind spot in gaming. I fired up NSO, started from the very beginning, and in just a couple of hours — made all the shorter by the blessing of Rewind — I finally made it to the very end.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly I stopped playing all those years ago, but if I had to guess, I'd say that everything from World 6 onwards felt new. This meant that I had never seen the monochrome 6-3, I had never dodged the flying Cheep Cheep bridge in 7-3 (although that feels like 2-3+, to be fair), and I had to actually work out the maze solutions in the final two castles.</p>
<p>It's got to be said — news flash! — it's a good game. There's a lot here that feels a bit outdated by today's standards (from a 40-year-old game? Never!), but on the whole, I was impressed by how <em>not</em>-outdated it felt.</p>
<p>Mario's jump always has been, and always will be, super satisfying. Lakitu is <em>still</em> an arsehole if you don't bop him on the head at early doors. And I wasn't anticipating quite so much of a difficulty spike at the end. I'm not going to say it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, but I'm once again grateful to the NSO gods for blessing us with the Rewind feature.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7707fe258163c/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After more retries than I care to admit, I ducked under Bowser's legs one last time and finally, <em>finally</em>, found Princess <del>Peach</del> Toadstool in the right castle. It was a good feeling, made all the sweeter by the sound of my previously revoked membership card to the Nintendo Fan Club dropping through my postbox.</p>
<p>And to think, it only took four decades of the game being on the market for me to finish it. Come back in 2036 to see me finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> (this is another joke, I promise).</p>

<p>Nintendo is really mixing it up nowadays with merchandise, and the next surprise product on the way is a talking flower. It's not just any talking flower though, it's the same one based on the character from the 2023 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros.

Here's some insight from Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi about this new product:</p><div><figure data-videoid="MjdXHwRDqMw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3948b1wsuzqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdXHwRDqMw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's that time of the week once again, and now that the Super Mario 40th anniversary plans have been fully unveiled via the latest Direct...well...we're maybe not gonna be diving into quite as much Mario as we had sorta hoped this weekend, as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy 1 and 2's</a> re-release and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> are a little ways off yet. But hey, we got more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> deets (and that's all this guy cares about right now)!</p>
<p>Yes, there was a big ol' Nintendo Direct yesterday and we got a ton of new info — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> has a release date! The new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> has a release date! We're getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon life sim</a>!</p>
<p>Besides the Direct, somebody out there is playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> (look, we've all got our crosses to bear), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> is the newest member of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">the Difficulty Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-every-exciting-new-game-from-the-acclaim-showcase">Acclaim held its own showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever it is you happen to be picking up to play this weekend, or if you're taking some time off from games to do there things (like dream about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>) make sure to let us know in the comments; for now, let's pass you over now to some of the Nintendo Life team as we detail what we're up to this weekend.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was all geared up and hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 1 and 2</a> announcement that we got, although I now have to wait (and they're really quite expensive), so cold water has been applied to those plans.</p>
<p>Now, instead, I'll defo be diving into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>, I'm excited for that, and I'll also take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, which I've been keen on since it first got announced a while back. I'm really hoping the talent at ProbablyMonsters delivers something special here! Oh, and my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> playthrough must low-key continue!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I recently got to Deepnest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Lovely place. Looking forward to exploring more there, definitely. Beyond that, I still haven't fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> continues to surprise/delight/astound.</p>
<p>And beyond <em>that</em>, Episode 9 of Robert Ashley's <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://alifewellwasted.com/" href="https://alifewellwasted.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Life Well Wasted</a> is sitting downloaded on my phone. It's been nearly three years since the last and, while I feel it deserves my undivided attention, listening in the kitchen while prepping something tasty sounds like a pretty perfect evening. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Y'know what, I might just play that newly-announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Bananza</a> DLC! It looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm on a bit of a <strong>Contra</strong> binge at the moment, so I'm playing a lot of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Anniversary Collection</a> on Switch. Those early entries really are peerless.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, same as last weekend, and every evening this week: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar.</a> What a game! Marvelous XSEED finally found the recipe for success!</p>
<p>It's packed with tiny, beautiful, entirely unnecessary details, like snow falling off trees when you run into them, lanterns and window shutters swaying in the wind, and animals that lie down to rest. I am so happy that this game exists, with this level of love and care put into it, and I hope that it's a sign of equally good Story of Seasons games to come!But also I will be on a plane next week, so I might need to pick a good Plane Game (again — I promise I don't usually travel this much. It's a family reunion! Blame them, not me.)</p>
<p>My personal game development projects right now are centering around MICROGAMES — fishing minigames, specifically, but more generally speaking, any tiny games-within-games that have compelling and moreish mechanics. I know that sounds like I should just play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare</a>, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I'm thinking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley's</a> fishing minigame, or (if anyone remembers it) the carpentry minigame in <strong>Puzzle Pirates</strong>. Recommendations absolutely encouraged! It's Research™!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Yes, I'm still playing Silksong. That's it. That's the tea.</p>
<p>My review is coming next week, but it's safe to say I <em>love</em> it. Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company this week announced connectivity between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> is scheduled for 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> got some of the spotlight in the latest broadcast, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-kirby-amiibo-will-apparently-be-nintendos-most-expensive-amiibo-ever">and apart from those new amiibo</a>, it's also been revealed there will be <em>another</em> 'Direct' taking place in the future.</p>
<p>This "2nd presentation" will once again be hosted by the game's director Masahiro Sakurai. We don't know what specifically will be revealed in this next show just yet or when exactly it will be aired but it's "on the way". During this week's Nintendo Direct, it was mentioned how "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" would be shared in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai also acknowledged this announcement via social media (here's a rough translation via DeepL):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was introduced to [a] Direct within [a] Direct... I'll do it! It's not something I can make right away, but please be patient"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we find out more about this upcoming Direct, we'll be sure to let you know. In the meantime, you can check out the previous Kirby Air Riders broadcast, which revealed the playable roster of racers, courses, items and power ups, multiplayer aspects and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced in the same Direct how its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app would be getting regular updates about Kirby Air Riders leading up to the title's release.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is out exclusively for the Switch 2 on 20th November 2025.
