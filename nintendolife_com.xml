<p>There's even a new ? silicone case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Remember Nintendo's collaboration with Fujifilm? The one that let you add all kinds of Switch-relevant frames and stickers to your screenshotted polaroids via the instax mini Link 3? Don't worry, we had forgotten about it too, but the company has just released a new update to help add an extra bit of Mushroom Kingdom flare to your physical snaps.</p>
<p>The main addition in this update is the instax AiR Studio. As the capitalisation on the former suggests, this new 'studio' lets you take photos with some Mario AR effects to boot — so, if you need a polaroid of your friend hitting a ? Block, holding a Red Shell, or popping out of a Warp Pipe, you're in luck!</p>
<p>Similarly self-explanatory is the new Click to Collage feature, which takes snaps at three-second intervals and lets you throw in some familiar Mario faces for good measure. With the collection snapped up, you can then print a polaroid of the full series, photobooth style.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Mario update without some fresh merch to boot, and Fujifilm revealed that a new limited edition instax mini Link 3 bundle featuring a sweet ? Block silicone case will be launching later this month for <strong>$149.95</strong>.</p>

<p>Fujifilm launched a similar bundle for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> update back in 2023, where the arrival of new in-app polaroid stickers and frames was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/01/ink-your-polaroids-with-splatoon-3-frames-and-stickers-in-new-instax-mini-link-app-update">accompanied by a squid-shaped case</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage this time around is that we have the Switch 2 to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-how-to-transfer-screenshots-from-switch-2-to-smartphone-pc-or-mac">transferring images from your console to mobile</a> <em>much</em> easier. The instax mini Link 3 works with both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2, we should add, but if you want to get snaps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> like the cool kids in the above trailer, you'll obviously need the latest hardware.</p>

We know y'all like a bit of stability with your updates.</p>
<p>The patch notes here are primarily for Steam, so there will likely be a few things that won't be relevant for us Switch / Switch 2 owners, but there's still plenty that will be of interest. There doesn't seem to be any major tweaks to the gameplay or difficulty with this one, so we're mainly looking at bugs and whatnot that have been kindly stamped out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957vgnpsk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Have you played Hollow Knight: Silksong yet? We reckon you probably should soon, having awarded it a coveted score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">10/10</a> in our review. We stated that developer Team Cherry "delivered a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre".</p>

<p>Before we get to this, it appears there's apparently one more update in the form of a live stream. This Japanese broadcast will take place next week on 21st October 2025 and will share the "latest updates" about the title's story mode, chronicle mode and versus mode.

<p>Fingers crossed this is just an update about the game's content, and Level-5 can reconfirm this latest entry really will be arriving next month on Nintendo platforms. The previous delay in July 2025 was apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". More recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-trailer-dives-into-level-5s-repeatedly-delayed-baller">we also got a new trailer for the title</a>.</p>
<p>This news follows Level-5's update in September that it would be delaying the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> until 2026. You can find out more about this in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<figure data-uuid="9ca0180a2161a"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9ca0180a2161a/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're at the point in the year where various outlets, companies, and events are handing out all sorts of nominations and awards.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Time Magazine's website has featured the Switch 2 on its "best inventions" list of 2025. This list features 300 of the "best inventions making the world better, smarter, and more fun", and includes categories like robotics, accessibility, apps and software, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is listed under the 'Entertainment &amp; Gaming' category, which is all about revolutionising how "we play, create, and consume content". One other notable device featured on this list is the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/tags/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. Here's the attached description for the Switch 2, along with a list of the other inventions featured in this category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The original Nintendo Switch rewrote the rules for portable gaming. Its 2025 sequel increases the power without sacrificing portability. A sampling of its impressive stats: An Nvidia Tegra T239 chip, alongside dedicated ray-tracing and Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) cores, lets the new model run at 4K on TVs, while the on-device 7.9-inch HDR display runs handheld titles at 1080p and 120Hz, meaning there’s no flicker during gameplay. Its 12 GB of LPDDR5X memory also helps keep sprawling open worlds stutter-free. Launched in June, the console sold 3.5 million units in its first week—making it Nintendo’s fastest-selling hardware ever."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TIME Best Inventions of 2025 - Entertainment &amp; Gaming</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Epson Lifestudio Flex Plus - Powerful Streaming, Anywhere</em></li>
<li><em>Falcon's Flight - The World's Biggest Rollercoaster</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Nintendo Switch 2 - Blockbuster Gaming Console</em></strong></li>
<li><em>Samsung Premiere 5 - A 4K Touchscreen Projector</em></li>
<li><em>Soundcore Rave 3S - On-Demand Karaoke</em></li>
<li><em>ROG Xbox Ally X - A Gaming PC On The Go</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the other categories and inventions listed on the Time website. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2 hardware review</a> here on Nintendo Life, we said the new system was a slick bit of kit and that Nintendo had done a decent job walking a very wobbly tightrope between 'surprise and delight' and 'more of the same'.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 was also recently shortlisted for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/mario-kart-world-and-donkey-kong-bananza-shortlisted-for-console-game-of-the-year">'best gaming hardware' award</a> alongside the system's Pro Controller. The exclusives <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have recently appeared on some award lists as well.</p>
