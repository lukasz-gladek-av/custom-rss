<figure data-uuid="f77e8d5ceb611"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds / Rise" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f77e8d5ceb611/monster-hunter-wilds-rise.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has today shared its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">financial results</a> for Q2 of FY2025/26, and the software sales numbers have left us rubbing our eyes and pulling a double take — is that the four-year-old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> putting up more new sales than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, yes it is. As noted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/monster-hunter-wilds-doing-so-badly-thats-its-been-outsold-by-mh-rise-devil-may-cry-5">Push Square</a>, there's a rather amusing wrinkle in the studio's Digital Contents Unit Sales Ranking this time around. Series newbie Monster Hunter Wilds — which shifted <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/monster-hunter-wilds-smashes-capcom-record-with-10-million-units-sold">10 million units</a> in its record-breaking opening weeks, let's not forget — is at the bottom of the pile with 637,000 sales in the first half of the fiscal year, while Rise is one spot above it with 643,000 sales.</p>
<p>That might not be a huge gap on paper, but it's exacerbated when we look at Q2 in isolation. Of those 637,000 sales, 477,000 came in <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">Q1</a>, meaning Wilds only shifted an additional 160,000 copies in the months since. Rise, on the flip side, managed 254,000 sales in the same period — a slight decline from the 389,000 sold in Q1, but what do you expect, it's <em>four years old</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4065e85c9a446"><a title="Capcom Q2 FY2025 Unit Sales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4065e85c9a446/capcom-q2-fy2025-unit-sales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">Capcom</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, the two Monster Hunters sit firmly at the bottom of the pile, outsold by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which put up 547,000 sales in Q2) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which actually sold the most units in Q2 (643,000), despite still falling behind <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a> on the fiscal year as a whole.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a bunch of reasons why Wilds might be falling behind Rise, despite being the <em>much</em> newer of the two — the latter's availability on more platforms and readily available bonus content, for example — but it's still kind of crazy to see how much the sales have dropped off after Capcom's stellar launch earlier this year.</p>
<p>You'll notice that a bunch of the titles in the above list will be making their way to Switch 2 before the fiscal year is up (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a> and Village will join <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> on the hybrid on 27th February), so it'll be interesting to see what that does to the total unit sales. Outside of that, we'll be keeping our fingers crossed for news of mainline MonHun coming our way at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Repent!</p>

<figure data-uuid="7add030a48a3d"><a title="The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7add030a48a3d/the-binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nicalis</em></figcaption></figure><p>Publisher Nicalis and developer Edmund McMillan have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus">The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 in <strong>Q1 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The release will boast the full game alongside key expansions and improvements, plus full cooperative play via online connection. If that's not enough, Repentance+ will also benefit from a full physical release, so no Game-Key Card here, folks.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://store.nicalis.com/products/repplus?variant=46804993999105">official Nicalis store</a>, though we'll be honest, we felt a bit of minor bit of whiplash at the <strong>£54</strong> asking price. It's not horrendous, but it's also not what we'd call 'affordable'.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Online play in all game modes, including daily runs, Greed mode, and challenges.<br>
- Extensive preference filters when hosting or searching for online matches.<br>
- Emote wheel and voice chat for online communication.<br>
- New “Item Descriptions” option reveals the full functionality of items you’ve previously collected.<br>
- New leaderboards for online play.<br>
- Over 700 different items to collect.<br>
- More than 300 enemy types and bosses.<br>
- Multiple difficulty settings, game modes, branching paths and endings to discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chances are this one will almost certainly be available digitally, so we'll be sure to provide more updates, including its price, as soon as we can.</p>
