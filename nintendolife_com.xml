<p>Sigils and Medals and Scrolls, oh my!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are rapidly approaching the <strong>30th October</strong> release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, and to drum up the hype in the remaining weeks, Square Enix has released yet another new trailer.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-overview-trailer">gameplay-focused</a> affair that arrived earlier this month, the fresh trailer is all about highlighting the games' new features. The four-minute trailer provides a pretty comprehensive breakdown of everything we can expect, from bonus characters and story content to additional gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>We'd recommend watching the above trailer for the full rundown, but, in short, here are the highlights. DQ2's Sigils now crop up in both games and are "vital to the story" of each, with Scrolls and Mini Medals also making an appearance. We get a closer look at the second game's new 'Ocean Floor' expansion, with its fresh wave of enemies, storylines, and 'Memories of the World' collectibles. There's also a rundown of the game's new character, the Princess of Cannock, and bonus Tombola minigame — maybe not the big addition <em>we</em> would have ended the trailer on, but what can you do?</p>
<p>All in all, it's still looking rather wonderful. The absence of a Switch 2 upgrade path sours the package somewhat, but if the end result can match last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> in terms of sheer joy, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>

<p>Say hello to the newest fighter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a cheeky little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-teases-new-playable-character">tease</a> last week, Super Evil Megacorp has today lifted the lid on the next wave of content heading to the TMNT roguelike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_splintered_fate">Splintered Fate</a> — and, brace yourselves, there's quite a lot.</p>
<p>The game will be landing a beefy free content update on <strong>30th September</strong>, with a new game mode, fresh levels, a bonus storyline, visual upgrades, and more all arriving as standard. What's more, a new batch of paid DLC will be cropping up on the same day, adding a fresh-faced playable character: Metalhead.</p>
<p>Let's start with those paid extras. Metalhead is Splintered Fate's first full-range fighter, bringing a laser gun and landmines to the game's usual hack-and-slash play style. Aside from the metallic menace, the DLC also includes five new artefacts to beef up your boost options mid-run.</p>
<p>But the real meat comes in the free update. The biggest addition for <em>all</em> players is the new Arcade Mode, which offers a fast-paced way to play through some combat with pals. There are new enemies and locales to get to grips with in this mode, and a new 'Hex and Flex' system that promises to mix up each run for the better (or worse).</p>
<p>The free update also includes a host of fun features like a new artefact, Drone Tools for passive ranged support, a 'Robotics Turtle Power Tree', and the bonus 'Pizza in Peril' storyline, which spins off from the new game mode.</p>

<p>And this is an <em>update</em>, so the dev also promises a bunch of fixes, quality-of-life improvements, balancing adjustments and more. The update notes on the <a href="https://superevilmegacorp.com/news/tmnt-splintered-fate-brings-its-biggest-ever-update/">Super Evil Megacorp website</a> even claim that there are some visual improvements to boot. <em>Totally tubular!</em></p>
<p>All in all, it feels like it might be a good time to give Splintered Fate another go. We had a good time with this radical roguelike when it first arrived on Switch last year, but felt that the natural comparisons to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> were never going to work in its favour.
