<p>Last week, we looked at Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey and Donald on the GBA, and it was a surprisingly close battle. In the end, Japan won with 42% of the vote. Europe came in second place with 30%, and North America bagged 27%.</p>
<p>This time, we're going back to the SNES to check out a rather deep cut: <strong>Weaponlord</strong>. Developed by Visual Concepts and published by Namco in 1995, it was a fighting game that received fairly mixed reception. It never received a sequel, though many believe that its mechanics would go on to inform the <strong>Soul Blade / SoulCalibur</strong> franchises.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63eqgixkz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23DYpTkUosk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's another duel this week as North America and Europe go head-to-head. So let's get to it.</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5f4ce8901e49/weaponlord-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a large, imposing logo taking centre stage and an even larger and imposing character in the background (with a second kinda covered up by the logo), the North American design is pretty badass, indeed. We love the art style too – very '90s. In fact, we're kinda puzzled as to why it didn't sell so well with such a cool cover.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66d18d6371458/weaponlord-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is uhhh... different? Really nice use of colour on this one, actually. It stands out a lot. Though the decision to not feature any characters is admittedly a bit of an odd one. When it comes to movies and games, faces sell. There are no faces here. Unless you count the scary skull in the middle.</p>

We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

<p>It released Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Oblivion Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e357206c5fb75/oblivion-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bethesda, Virtuos</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">Switch port specialist Virtuos</a> – known within the Nintendo space for its work on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> – has officially laid off 270 employees across its studios worldwide.</p>
<p>This is "approximately 7%" of the company's "global workforce", with 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe axed, "primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts" in the game industry.</p>
<p>The latest update follows the surprise release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a> (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-tops-the-list-in-new-best-selling-games-roundup-for-the-us">which seemingly got off to a great start</a>) on other platforms earlier this year, and the company specifically notes how these layoffs include "fewer than 10 in France", where this core team is located.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">blog on the Virtuos website</a> titled "Adapting For The Future Of Game Development", the company went into detail about how it intends to evolve and realign its structure to strengthen its "high-value co-development":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry. As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services."</p>
<p>"...Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe. These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming, and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos says it's "grateful for the contributions of those impacted" and will be providing separation packages along with career transition assistance, and opportunities for "redeployment" within its global network where possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's promised it remains "fully committed" to its partnerships, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/12/more-cyberpunk-2077-updates-could-be-coming-as-cdpr-enlists-outside-help-for-patch-2-2">including its "ongoing work"</a> on titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. This news follows Microsoft laying off over 9,000 employees earlier this month, including staff under the Xbox division.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video: Switch 2 Vs. Steam Deck System Face-Off, Digital Foundry Investigates]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-switch-2-vs-steam-deck-system-face-off-digital-foundry-investigates</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry has returned with a new "system face-off" video – this time putting Nintendo's hybrid hardware, the Switch 2, up against Valve's PC handheld, the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the video above, you can see how the Switch 2 holds up against the Steam Deck OLED model across various "head-to-head" match-ups, including battery life, form factor, controller design, as well as OS and software availability.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie acknowledges how there are some obvious similarities, but also notes how these are two very different systems at the end of the day. Here are his closing thoughts, if you don't get the chance to watch the full video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think the Switch 2 is better as a console-like device than the Steam Deck is. It offers a streamlined, stress-free experience for playing controller-oriented games, the OS is rock solid, it docks perfectly, and it has great exclusive games - it's a more enjoyable, delightful machine to use moment to moment, if you want a slick gaming experience, it's hard to go wrong here, but it doesn't have the flexibility of a PC handheld, it can't access thousands upon thousands of PC games, you can't add special launch parameters, change up settings, swap refresh rates, or check out performance overlays, and you don't have the control options to make cursor oriented software work on the go. So, each machine has its strengths.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2 is a great machine to enjoy a game like Cyberpunk 2077 or exclusives like Mario Kart World or Fast Fusion, but a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 benefits enormously from having trackpad input, and the deck can play a larger vaiety of software, including older games that will probably never get a Switch 2 release. It's kind of an intractable battle, a fight between a console and essentially a PC in a console suit. Personal preferences and priorities are going to dictate this one, but I think most gamers will find a lot to like in both devices."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it comes down to what's best for you, along with your personal preferences, according to Digital Foundry. If you're eager to see more, Digital Foundry has also done comparisons of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and investigated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-tests-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation">Switch 2's GameCube emulation</a>.</p>
