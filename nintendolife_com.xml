<p>Fans are already calling for a Switch 2 port</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lies of P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c3299b595/lies-of-p.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's been a difficult year for the video game industry at times, but there are still plenty of success stories out there and the latest one is a sales milestone for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studio.</p>
<p>While we don't have anything to report here about a Switch 2 release (<em>at least for now</em>), according to South Korean publication <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec (via VGC)</a>, Korean publisher Neowiz is rewarding every member of the local development team with Nintendo's brand-new system after the success of the new DLC 'Overture' and more than three million cumulative sales.</p>
<p>It doesn't end there, with the team also getting launch bonuses (of roughly $7,300) and two weeks paid vacation on top of the country's "mandatory 15 days of paid vacation". And hey, there's all that time to enjoy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other games!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this news has resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lg3ono/lies_of_p_devs_get_bonus_paid_holiday_and_switch/">Switch 2 and Nintendo fans calling for a port</a>. The action RPG with "soulslike" elements launched on platforms like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as well as the next-generation systems in 2023, so maybe there's a chance. For now, soulslike fans with a Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> as well as FromSoftware's new multiplayer game.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released on the PS5, our pals at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p"><strong>Push Square</strong></a> awarded it eight out ten stars – calling it a "first-class" souls-like experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lies of P feels like the result of a developer having already taken multiple stabs at the Souls-like genre, so it's impressive that Round8 Studio has accomplished so much on its first attempt. By fully embracing its dark take on the Pinocchio story, it sets itself apart from anything else available. Elevating it above other games are quality combat and extensive, satisfying customisation, turning Lies of P into a first-class experience for FromSoftware fanatics."</p>

<p>"Put the pedal to the metal"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a racing fan and are looking for something else to play on the Switch 2, you'll pleased to hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now compatible on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>Developer Feral Interactive has provided an update on the state of the game – confirming it's now ready to race on the new hardware. There was apparently an "issue that was blocking startup" that's now been resolved in the latest Switch 2 firmware update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feral Interactive:</strong> "Switch 2 racers rejoice! The high-octane thrills of GRID Autosport are now playable on your shiny new console! An issue that was blocking startup has been fixed by the new Switch 2 firmware update, so grab yourself the latest version and put the pedal to the metal!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="PH9AJiL5EQ8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH9AJiL5EQ8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>The eShop game page for GRID Autosport includes the following notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updated 06/19/2025 - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GRID Autosport originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">made its debut on the Switch in 2019</a>, with a multiplayer update patched in at a later date. While the performance was already decent on the Switch, the experience should be even more enjoyable on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This is one of many third-party Switch titles to benefit from Nintendo's latest firmware update for the Switch 2. You can find out more in our previous coverage and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility guide</a>.</p>

<p>According to updated listings, Nintendo has been able to work its magic and reduce the game's file size from 10GB down to 8.5GB. It's not all that much, but given the size of various other titles on the Switch 2, we're sure many users will appreciate the extra space.</p>
<p>Although this game is less than half the size of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (which had a file size of 21.9GB at launch) it will still be packed with many sub-layers to explore.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hloxjp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>During the Donkey Kong Direct this week, Nintendo revealed Odd Rock is actually Pauline along with features like a co-op mode, multiple transformations for DK, and even a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">new Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo</a>.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively for the Switch 2 on <strong>17th July</strong>, with the new amiibo arriving on the same date.</p>

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XVI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01c7eb5647920/final-fantasy-xvi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has supposedly hinted at bringing its latest mainline <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy</a> game to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936193603837346175">'Genki_JPN' on social media</a>, during a <a href="https://youtu.be/Zg-LRoukGVo">live stream broadcast</a>, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a></strong> producer Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro briefly touched on the game's future and how Nintendo is the only platform left to conquer.</p>
<p>It's led to plenty of speculation online, with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/page-3">some Final Fantasy fans already convinced</a> a "Switch 2 port" could be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Before anyone gets too excited, Square Enix's current focus is on bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Intergrade</a></strong> to the Switch 2 this Winter. The tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is also scheduled to arrive in September.</p>
<p>Following its PlayStation 5 and PC release, Final Fantasy XVI was made available on Xbox Series X|S earlier this month and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/according-to-sales-estimates-final-fantasy-16-had-a-rough-first-week-on-xbox">it's got off to a rough start (in terms of sales)</a> as highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This apparent tease follows on from Yoshi-P previously mentioning how a Nintendo release of Final Fantasy XIV Online <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">could be on the cards</a>. For now, though, nothing has been officially announced or confirmed about either of these Final Fantasy games coming to Nintendo's platforms.</p>

<p>See you next time</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> made its debut on the Switch 2 earlier this month and now that chapters one to four are available, you might be wondering when the next one drops.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the end credits of the fourth episode have confirmed chapter 5 will be arriving in <strong>2026</strong>. There's no specific date attached to this release window, but it's scheduled for some point next year. So, there you go!</p>

<p>Deltarune originally debuted on the Switch eShop as a free download in 2019 and in a development update last December, creator Toby Fox mentioned how the fifth chapter was making "steady" progress.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this '2026' release sticks and we see the next chapter arrive within its scheduled window. We should also have a Deltarune Switch 2 review going live here on Nintendo Life at some point in the future, so be on the lookout for that.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
