<p>After being announced back in the March 2025 Direct, Living the Dream has since cropped up again at the September showcase with a 'Spring 2026' release date. It looks expectedly silly, but we still have very little idea of what <em>new</em> stuff it will bring to the table over its 3DS predecessor.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we won't have long until we find out. The Living the Dream Direct promises 20 minutes of info, kicking off on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent) at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>It's a game all about friendship and community, so it feels only right that you can watch along with us below. The Direct will kick off in just a few minutes, so grab yourself a beverage and get comfy, things are about to begin!</p>

<p>Nintendo is no stranger to a banging soundtrack. The company also isn't wholly against releasing said soundtracks on vinyl — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> is scoring an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">eight-LP box set</a> later this year, for example — but there's no way that the House of Mario could possibly cover <em>everything</em> in delightful disc form. That's where fans like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@huappyspins">Huappy Spins</a> come in.</p>
<p>We weren't aware of Huappy Spins' work until this week, when we first spotted the vinyl pressing of '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_o3Fza5fFs">The Sounds of the Nintendo 3DS</a>' that you'll find above. Being the big old nerds that we are, we gobbled the whole thing up in one sitting, vibing to familiar bops like 'Home Menu' and 'Mii Maker', shedding a tear for the loss of Miiverse and its impeccable tunes, and pouring one out for forgotten classics like 'Activity Log Software Library'.</p>
<p>Sure, it's a digital recording of a vinyl playing a digital soundtrack, but you can't tell us that there isn't something satisfying about seeing those familiar beeps and boops come from a spinning plastic disc.</p>
<p>So, you can only imagine our joy when we took a look through Huappy Spins' account and saw a huge back catalogue of Nintendo soundtracks that they have ripped in the past. There's a vinyl for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAFwb4G_3vE">Mario Party 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aodLU51FCnI">Yoshi's Woolly World</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWug0tiAkok">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2roH9DewDk">Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow</a>. They've even sorted releases for indies and third-party releases that we've poured hours into on Nintendo systems, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzbEsJ3ShdA">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl6GXYsoUs">Spiritfarer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZLJ4d3CTHw">Citizen Sleeper</a> and this writer's beloved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ58D8qy2_g">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</a>.</p>
<p>All of these pressings appear on a colourful vinyl — often matching the game itself — with unique centre stickers to really sell the listening vibes. Heck, the thumbnails for each even show off a neat original sleeve for each LP.</p>
<p>Now okay, they're not for sale, so it's not as if you'll be able to add any of these to your collection right now, but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon than by listening to some of your favourite soundtracks as a colourful disc spins around on your screen.</p>
<p>In fact, we'll finish by linking to a couple more of our favourites below. Happy listening!</p>

<p>Big(goron) envy</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's been a cracking start to the year for Nintendo-themed LEGO sets, and one of the builds we're the most excited about is the upcoming 'Final Battle' diorama, inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>'s grand finale.</p>
<p>The set itself launches on <strong>1st March 2026</strong> for <strong>£99.99 / $129.99</strong>, packing in three Minifigures for Link, Zelda and Ganondorf, plus a big 'mech' build for ol' boar-form Ganon. Naturally, there are a handful of little easter eggs sprinkled in for fans as well, like a tiny Navi that accompanies Link in his airborne pose, and a hidden Megaton Hammer in the ruins of Ganondorf's Castle.</p>
<p>Before it hits store shelves, however, LEGO reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has gone hands-on with the set and provided a five-minute deep dive into its intricacies to give us our best look at it yet. The video provides a closer look at the stunning Zelda and Ganon Minifigs (the Link remains the same from the Deku Tree set), and the big Ganondorf build.</p>
<p>It also lets us get up close and personal with the diorama design itself, showcasing the castle backdrop without any of the characters in it, and the secret 'trapdoor' hatch from which Ganondorf can spring out for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather neat — and not as pricey as we'd expect, after seeing the Deku Tree and recently-revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-pokemon-reveals-first-sets-launches-february-2026">Pokémon sets</a>. Gosh, we're going to have to clear some shelf space, aren't we?</p>
