<p>Switch update confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco officially lifted the lid on Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> in this week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>This game will be coming to Nintendo's platforms later this year on <strong>14th November 2025</strong> and pre-orders are available now. It follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">a rating for this platform earlier this year</a> in Saudi Arabia. This latest game is powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's also mentioned in the PR how these versions of the game will come with local multiplayer and motion controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO takes the legendary gameplay of the Budokai Tenkaichi series and raises it to whole new levels. Become a super warrior and experience the earth-shaking, limit-breaking power of Dragon Ball battles!</p>
<p>THE BIGGEST ROSTER IN HISTORY Unleash the strength of over 180 fighters from Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball GT, and selected Dragon Ball movies, all in the base game! Each character comes with their own signature abilities, transformations, and techniques.</p>
<p>BREATHTAKING 3D FIGHTS Engage in heart-pounding, high-speed 3D battles that stay true to the anime and video game series, with breathtaking visuals and authentic combat moves like beam clashes, rush attacks, movements too quick for the eyes to see, and planet-razing ultimate attacks.</p>
<p>RIVALS MAKE YOU STRONGER Challenge players online to test your skills, enjoy local multiplayer with up to six players on a single console, or connect multiple consoles for wireless play. Experience intense battles and become a Super Warrior with immersive motion controls using the Joy-Con™ controllers.</p>
<p>BLAZE A NEW PATH Conquer the action-packed battles from the beloved original story, or discover and unlock new encounters for your favorite Z-Fighters and more. Relive your favorite moments from the series through cutscenes you can experience from the perspectives of eight characters!</p>
<p>CREATE, PLAY, AND SHARE Recreate your favorite battles from throughout the Dragon Ball story, or set up your dream story battle with your favorite characters! Share your creations with other fans and experience the battles brought to life by imaginations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title is available for <strong>$59.99</strong> digitally on the Switch and Switch 2 (or the regional equivalent), and pre-orders are once again live. There are also Deluxe and Ultimate Editions featuring Season Pass content and DLC.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the video above, there will also be an update for the Switch physical and digital versions of this game, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>

<p>It's scheduled to arrive in 2025</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Masahiro Sakurai's latest project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> soars onto the Switch 2 at some point later this year.</p>
<p>While we haven't heard all that much about it since the initial announcement in April, the game has reportedly been rated in Saudi Arabia recently – receiving an age rating in this location of "7 and above" (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/31/kirby-air-riders-for-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-rated-in-saudi-arabia/">via My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Sakurai did provide a small update about this title earlier in July, mentioning how it was "shaping up to be something great". This also happened to be timed in with the 22nd anniversary of the original GameCube title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The classification for this title hopefully means a release isn't too far away. If this new Kirby racer does make its 2025 window, it will join other racing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo releases coming to the Switch this year include titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and the Koei Tecmo project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was featured during this week's Partner Direct.</p>

<p>The new entry arrives this October</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Battlefield 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b15e48190d790/battlefield-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Switch 2 Partner Showcase</a> has just revealed what's ahead for the new hybrid platform in terms of third-party offerings, but it seems one series that won't be showing up any time soon is EA's popular military shooter Battlefield.</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke to Battlefield's head Vince Zempella as part of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI">multiplayer reveal today</a>, and it's been officially confirmed the company "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>The team is focused on delivering the game where the "core Battlefield audience is present", according to the same story.</p>
<p>EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">official FAQ for Battlefield 6</a> further confirms how the new entry, which launches on <strong>10th October 2025</strong>, will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (including the Steam, EA App, and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>Although EA won't be delivering Battlefield 6 on the Switch 2, earlier today the third-party giant announced it would be releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants Vs Zombies: Replanted</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, following a series of rumours. EA will also be bringing the latest entries in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> series to the new platform as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>This news about Battlefield follows on from Microsoft and Activision revealing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">would be released on Nintendo platforms</a> going forward.</p>
