<p>With mouse controls and 120fps, too!</p>

<p>Japanese developer ITL is returning to one of its DSiWare titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a>, and bringing it to the Switch 2 in just two days — on 31st July 2025 — for the bargain price of <strong>£5.00 / $7.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The original game launched as a DSiWare title back in 2010 and is a simple, neon-coloured air hockey game. However, it was exclusive to Japan. This version <em>looks</em> to be a polished-up version of the original, making it the first time it's available in the West.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itl.ne.jp/Products/HandyHockey/en/">the official website</a>, ITL confirms the game is entirely playable in Mouse Mode, and players can take one Joy-Con 2 each and use the mice to play against one another. Even cooler, you can place the Switch 2 screen on the table and play the game as though it were a real air hockey table.</p>
<p>Up to four players can take part in a match, and the game will also run at 120fps, making it one of the first games on the system to reach that cap.</p>
