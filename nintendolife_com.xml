<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160990/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I had a moment of realisation while flipping my Switch 2 around in my hand and tapping at the screen in an effort to solve yet another clever-but-abstract puzzle. I realised that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> was one of the most unabashedly original sets of experiences I had encountered in a long time.</p>
<p>The funny thing was that I had already played every game in this collection years before. It had been so long that the zenith of mobile gaming had slipped into the realm of half-forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Simogo Games is perhaps better known for two stylised and mechanically unique titles from recent years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sayonara_wild_hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> (2019) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lorelei_and_the_laser_eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> (2024). It <em>may</em> surprise some that it is actually a storied studio with 15 years of history, recognised for fiercely original titles built for mobile devices. Those are the games that the Simogo Legacy Collection brings together. It features seven titles that both exemplify the early heyday of mobile games and manage to transcend that format.</p>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160987/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is as lovingly curated a collection as you are likely to get, rivalling Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Agold-master-series">Gold Master Series</a> for presentation and additional extras. The stylish menu is fashioned as a mobile phone screen, with tiles that take you to games, settings, and a wealth of bonus material. You are free to cycle between a vast collection of music as you wander the digital halls of this studio's archives.</p>
<p>The games themselves range from fun time sinks to rich artistic endeavours. All of them need equal attention, so it is best to tackle them one by one.</p>
<p>First up is <strong>Kosmo Spin</strong>, which is perhaps the most mobile-game-like experience here and a sign of a studio taking its first steps in the industry. It is a cute collectathon that plays with perspective by having you rotate the screen to guide a robot around a planetoid. You rescue robot buddies and avoid an enemy UFO that hurls projectiles and tries to hoover you up.</p>
<p>Next is <strong>Bumpy Road</strong>, a deceptively simple exercise in hand-eye coordination. Your task is to guide a car across the screen, although the hook is that you move the vehicle by deforming the road underneath it with your finger. I had a lot of fun with this one, mostly failing.</p>

<p><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> is an odd but addictive combination of stealth and rhythm action. You control a thief who sneaks through Donkey Kong-style multi-level areas, and you can only move by tapping the screen to the beat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/year_walk">Year Walk</a> is perhaps the developer's most beloved mobile title and much more of a purely artistic experience than the previous three. Previously available on the Wii U eShop until Nintendo shut up shop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/countdown-wii-u-eshop-spotlight-year-walk">in March 2023</a>, it explores Scandinavian folklore with an atmospheric walking (swiping?) simulator of sorts, in which you transition through screens, interact with the environment and uncover mysteries. It remains richly atmospheric to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Device 6</strong> and <strong>The Sailor’s Dream</strong> are mechanically similar puzzle mysteries that rely on your exploration skills. Device 6 has you traverse prose and interact with images in a book to help protagonist Anna figure out where she is. The Sailor’s Dream expands the concept of exploration by having you sail across the ocean and visit experiential locations.</p>

<p>Finally, there is <strong>SPL-T</strong>, an ostensibly simple puzzle game where you tap on a wireframe grid to create ever smaller divisions. This one is a compulsive experience that hides neat little easter eggs tied to screen interaction.</p>
<p>All of these games are sharply updated to look great on the Switch display. Since they were developed for small touchscreens, they feel most comfortable when played undocked. Simogo has added all kinds of quality-of-life features to make the games more playable on both screens, including open orientation switching and simultaneous touch and stick controls.</p>
<p>The one caveat is that most of the games feel a bit clunky on a large display. Even with accessible controls, these titles were made specifically for a small screen. That said, the Switch 2 version fully supports mouse controls, which helps a great deal when playing docked. Being able to move the screen and control the game with smooth mouse movement is a real boon.</p>

<p>Simogo Legacy Collection feels like the developer has considered <em>everything</em> in translating these games to consoles. It adapts mobile-first experiences into versatile ports that account for the player's needs. Outside of the porting work, these games offer seven distinct and captivating experiences that still feel fresh years after their release. Simogo plays around with the form and function of well-worn templates to create something surprising and new.</p>
<p>Even Year Walk, the most purely narrative experience here, is a unique take on the storytelling style of classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/myst">Myst</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/room">The Room</a>. SPL-T, on the other hand, is so subtle in its execution that you might spend hours tapping the screen before realising you are playing a postmodern twist on endless arcade puzzlers.</p>
<p>If you enjoy puzzle-driven narratives and experimental design, this bundle is nothing less than essential.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Polishing and repackaging its mobile output, Simogo have created an essential collection of classics, where every game is worth your time. Despite their mobile origins, these titles feel tailor-made for Switch and the devs have fully embraced the console's feature set.</p></section>

<p>2025 has been a bumper one across the board, with brilliant games big and small — indie, are-they-indie?, and absolutely-definitely-not-indie — launching every single month.

Oh, and Nintendo launched a whole new platform.

</ul>
<p>Not a bad octet, is it? So, it's time to start looking through the gems we've played in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Below you'll find <strong>every Switch game we've reviewed in 2025 awarded a 6/10 or higher.</strong> To rate any games you've played, registered users can click the star next to the corresponding title and give them a score out of 10. <strong>We encourage you to use the search bar</strong>, but otherwise you can browse at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: All Switch 1 and 2 games released in 2025 are eligible and available to rate in our database.</strong> We've limited the ones shown below to cull endless pages of shovelware, but if there's something we didn't review (or just didn't enjoy as much as you), find it by heading to the search bar at the very top of the page and going directly to that game's page.</p>
<p>We'll go live with the results later in the month, and due to the real-time nature of the list, games launched between now and the end of the year still have every chance of showing up in the Top 50, too. No one's left behind!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Thanks for 'voting'! Our database should contain every game released in 2025, but please let us know below if anything is missing and we'll get it added. Happy rating!</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/community-its-time-to-rate-your-switch-1-and-2-games-of-the-year]]></content:encoded>

<p>Let's try our best to recap the last seven days, shall we?

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194214,194403 @ 1765040562 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Shock, horror, I'm playing Metroid. I'm still a relative noob to the series, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a> had me in a chokehold back in 2023, and Beyond is doing exactly the same so far. Sure, it's <em>technically</em> my brother's birthday celebrations this weekend, but he won't mind if I bring my Switch along and pad out the old scan logbook at dinner, will he?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Hello, yes, I am also playing the big new Nintendo Switch 2 release of the week… Octopath Traveler 0. Wait! Don’t boo me!</p>
<p>Sorry Samus, I’ve opted for cosy turn-based gameplay for the holiday season, in true Alana fashion. Don’t worry, I will get to Viewros once the dust has settled, but right now, the price tag is a little too steep for something that might not be my cup of tea.</p>
<p>I’ve also got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and I’m trying to finish up the DLC and tidy my island a little before the big update. It’s coming along! Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend. Hmmm. I want to say I'm going to play loads of Metroid like everyone else, and I've very much really enjoyed what I've played so far, but I'm actually fully distracted by Assassin's Creed Shadows and am therefore very likely gonna end up stuck in that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes Prime 4 it is. With a side-helping of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> because I'm genuinely addicted to the multiplayer City Trials.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>December came out fighting with me still clobbering punks in the streets of the belt action game of the year, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, over the weekend. I doubt I will actually have time to give Assassin’s Creed Shadows the attention it deserves, and the same goes for the wonderful (gatcha-free!) Octopath Traveler 0, because I want to keep roaming the streets in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, wrap up Melinoë’s quest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and kick the ball around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> (Do publishers realise there are eleven other months in the year!?).</p>
<p>To space pirates’ disappointment around the galaxy, my game of the week is obviously Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Indeed, beyond my wildest dreams, Samus' first-person adventure is back after a hiatus of eighteen years and straight to being a very strong contender for my personal GOTY 2025. I will make the most of this extended weekend in Portugal to dutifully scan everything the game throws at me.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>A new <a href="https://hermitcraft.com/">Hermitcraft</a> season (check it out on YouTube, it's the best) means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">MINECRAFT</a> TIME, so I've spun up a server to play with my pals using the new(ish) Copper Age stuff. We're still pre-diamonds, so early days, but it's fun.</p>
<p>I've also been playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, and having a surprisingly good time! It starts real slow and boring, which is baffling, since it's a game that's all about comedy and wacky hijinks, so I'm not sure why they decided to have such a serious beginning. But there's some incredibly clever narrative and game design stuff in there, like unlocking "flaws" based on your behaviour — I kept stealing, because it's basically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Skyrim</a> In Space, so the game asked me if I wanted to become a Kleptomaniac, which would make all my stolen stuff sell for more (yay!) but also add a chance that I automatically steal something just by looking at it. Unsurprisingly, it's gotten me into a LOT of trouble, but that's what makes the game fun!</p>
<p>Aaaaand I finally got to the (story) end of Hades II, and... mmm, yeah, it's not great. Actually quite disappointing how almost all the plot gets dumped right at the end, rather than being sprinkled throughout the game. I can only assume that Supergiant wanted to keep it secret for as long as possible while in Early Access, so they left it right to the end? I don't know! It's not a good ending, even with the update! It's still an incredible game, so I'm not really all that bothered, and I don't regret my purchase... I'm just disappointed. But I'll keep playing!</p>

<p>With this in mind, the same Switch title has now <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/12/04/pikmin-4-listed-as-having-switch-2-enhancements-on-eshop-update-incoming/">reportedly popped up</a> in a section on the eShop, which focuses on first-party Nintendo "games with free updates" and also notes how select titles are enhanced when played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This discovery was originally shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/1pe84ll/pikmin_4_is_listed_as_having_a_switch_2_update_on/?share_id=PHUUC4t9ZRTKsLLq2QdcD&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Pikmin subreddit (via My Nintendo News)</a> and has also surfaced in other regions, as highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1996721280351904211">Universo Nintendo editor Felipe Lima</a>. Here's the attached description along with a look:</p><div><figure data-videoid="AsYPINDc4Aw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytAsYPINDc4Aw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed34c7a8hxrvgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Enhance select games when played on the Nintendo Switch 2 system"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As you can see, the game featured alongside Pikmin 4 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which <em>did</em> receive a free Switch 2 upgrade in June – optimising the game's visuals and adding HDR support.</p>
<p>We've taken a look at the page, and it appears Pikmin 4 has now been removed from this section. The other titles listed here are based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">the 12 free upgrades</a> released alongside the launch of the Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (which also got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-heres-how-splatoon-3-on-switch-2-improves-visuals-and-performance">Switch 2 update in June</a>).</p>
<p>So, what might all this mean? As mentioned in the post above, it could just be a "mistake" on Nintendo's end, so it's probably best not to get too excited. And now that it's been removed, it seems this might be the case. Of course, this hasn't stopped <em>some</em> <a href="https://x.com/MyNintendoNews/status/1996709298651779139/quotes">Pikmin 4 enthusiasts from getting their hopes up</a> – suggesting it could be a sign of a future update.</p>
<p>For now, Pikmin 4 hasn't received a dedicated Switch 2 update. If we do hear any significant developments, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Mega Mall updated alongside updates for Chrono Cross &amp; more</p>

<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 last week, and it's once again led to a bunch of Switch games receiving compatibility updates.</p>
<p>We've already covered the updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>, and it appears one other game that's also been fixed is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story">Mega Mall Story</a> from the Kairosoft series.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100bbc00cb9a000">Nintendo's official compatibility page</a>, the management simulation title was updated earlier this week, with "previously identified issues" now resolved.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rhoqlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story_2">Mega Mall Story 2</a> is still apparently "unsupported" on Nintendo's platform, and other Kairosoft titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/game_dev_story">Game Dev Story</a> also appear to have issues.</p>
<p>Apart from this fix for Mega Mall Story, some issues have also reportedly been identified some other titles. This includes a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, which abruptly closes the game if you select 'Extra' from the menu. And, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hazel_sky">Hazel Sky</a> also has some graphics issues.</p>
<p>If you didn't already see it, a compatibility update was also released for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> and multiple other games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>
