<figure><a title="The House of the Dead 2: Remake 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829dbc3fb109d/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>An arcade light gun classic is coming out on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> as Forever Entertainment's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a> brings zombies, bullets, and gore to Switch. The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy — the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/422efc4616565/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Oof</em>, well this has been <em>quite</em> the day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> content, eh? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184093 @ 1750281965 -->
<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750279586 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac54d4227a89c/dk-bananza-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, before the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a>, I wasn't <em>massively</em> enthusiastic about Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 platformer.</p>
<p>I played about 20 minutes of it at one of the Switch 2 Experience events back in April, and although I was charmed by the aesthetics and the ability to smash up pieces of the environment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more - that Nintendo was holding back a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. It held back a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>This Direct was simply magnificent and my excitement has gone from about 45/100 bananas all the way up to about 98. That's a lot of bananas! Where are the remaining two, you ask? Well, King K. Rool isn't there, but we can't have everything now, can we?</p>

<p>My concern around the playable demo was that the game would amount to little more than smashing through the terrain to find collectibles ('Banandium Gems'). Surely there was more to it, right? Well, yes.</p>
<p>For starters, let's just touch on the wonderful bait and switch regarding Odd Rock and Pauline. We kinda knew something like this was in the works following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">unfortunate leak</a>, but it's still an incredible move. I honestly couldn't click with Odd Rock from the earlier promotional material, so to learn that DK will instead spend his time with a young Pauline was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can keep your depressing father/daughter dynamic, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_i">The Last of Us</a> – this is much more up my street.</p>

<p>Pauline's not just there for show, either. With special Bananza Powers, she can burst into song and enable DK to transform into completely new forms. Kong Bananza looks absolutely awesome, but I'm sorry, Zebra Bananza? <em>Ostrich Bananza..?!</em> I'm gonna need plushies of those right now, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The transformations grant you extra strength, speed, and the ability to fly, and just these alone make the gameplay look infinitely more varied and compelling than what I saw in the early demo. I've a feeling there might be a few more transformations Nintendo hasn't revealed just yet too. How about Sloth Bananza? <em>Anyone..?</em></p>
<p>Quick glimpses of other gameplay features — including the Challenge Course Ruins, the skill tree, and collectible costumes — did a lot to boost my excitement too. Side-scrolling levels are back! Rambi is back! And I simply can't wait to experiment with the different clothing and colour options. Who knew that an ice-themed Donkey Kong would look so cool?</p>

<p>And of course, I have to give a shoutout to the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-channels-super-mario-64-energy-with-its-dk-artist-mode">DK Artist mode</a>. As someone who messed around with the 3D menu-screen Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> longer than I care to admit, being able to chip chunks off DK's face or Bowser's hair and create some truly terrifying monstrosities makes me more excited than DK gobbling up a Banandium Gem. It looks absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>all</em> for me, admittedly. Chances are I won't go into photo mode too much or jump into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op multiplayer</a>, and there's not a hope in hell I'm buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">another amiibo</a>, but I appreciate their inclusion regardless.</p>
<p>I've got to be honest, though: after the incredibly disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> Direct</a> in April, which basically just went over everything we already knew and did very little to move my excitement beyond about 70 blue shells out of 100, the DK Direct totally 180-ed me.</p>
<p>I was <em>mildly</em> excited before, but now it's my most anticipated game of the year. Bravo, Nintendo. Just don't tell Samus.</p>
