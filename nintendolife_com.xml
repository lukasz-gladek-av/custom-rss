<p>Let's go, Tokyo!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a little something to make you smile. The Pokémon Company has today shared another look at its upcoming theme park, 'PokéPark Kanto', and announced that gates will open on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Tickets to this new section of Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park will open for Japanese residents on 21st November and will be distributed by a lottery. There's currently no information on how those of us who live in other countries can nab tickets, but the official English booking website currently hosts a "Coming Soon" message, so keep an eye out for updates in the coming months.</p>
<p>But what's this PokéPark all about? This permanent outdoor Pokémon experience — the first of its kind, surprisingly — is divided into two areas: the Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the forest area will be your chance to see Pokémon 'in the wild'. Okay, it's actually just a bunch of statues dotted throughout a woodland walk, but you can expect photo ops aplenty with the likes of Pikachu, Eevee and Nidoran.</p>
<p>Sedge Town is more of a commercial area, with a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart you can pop into for merch, rides like the 'Pika Pika Paradise' and 'Vee Vee Voyage', and the 'Sedge Gym' show area.</p>


<p>It all looks really rather sweet, if you ask us. If you happen to find yourself in Tokyo next February, you know this'll be worth popping into.</p>

<p>Pikmin pictures</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo surprised us all last month when it announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> would be getting a free content update at some point in November. Well, that "some point" finally has a date — it's today!</p>
<p>Yes, Pikmin 4 was officially updated to ver. 1.1.0 this morning, adding new gameplay options like difficulty modes, the 'Field Camera' item, Decor Pikmin and more. It might not be the grand 'Switch 2 Edition' that we were all secretly hoping for (you'll find no additional perks on the new hardware here), but it <em>is</em> an excuse to dive back into a new save file, and we could all do with that.</p>
<p>Besides these content additions, the update also includes new control options, bonus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> connectivity, and a handful of bug fixes. The patch has even rolled out to the game's free demo, so you can see some of these newbies in action without having to spend a penny.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62986/~/how-to-update-pikmin-4">Nintendo Support website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 4 ver. 1.1.0 (11th November 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Newly Added Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now choose from three different activity levels for creatures: Relaxed, Normal, and Fierce.
<ul>
<li>This can be changed at any time from Settings in Options (- Button).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now take pictures with the “Field Camera” item and decorate them with stamps and frames.
<ul>
<li>The Field Camera is added to your bag on the morning of day 2.</li>
<li>If resuming save data from before the software is updated, it will be added to your bag when you return to the Rescue Command Post and morning arrives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Decor Pikmin” will now appear in the story.
<ul>
<li>To have Decor Pikmin join your squad, after rescuing the Rescue Corps Ranger Dingo, use the Field Camera to take pictures of a Decor Pikmin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By sharing the data of Decor Pikmin who have joined your squad in the full version of Pikmin 4 with the smart device application Pikmin Bloom, you can also get seedlings for those same Decor Pikmin in Pikmin Bloom.
<ul>
<li>You can send the Nintendo Account ID and discovered Decor Pikmin data when you finish exploration on the day the Decor Pikmin was discovered.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Account must be the same between the user playing Pikmin 4 and the one playing Pikmin Bloom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use “Roll Over” in which you begin another playthrough, carrying over some of the save data on a file that has cleared the story.
<ul>
<li>With save data present that has cleared the story, select an empty Rescue Database on the file selection screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have ever reached the morning of day 2 in the story, you may skip that introduction when playing again from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>You begin from exploration day 2 in which you head for Sun-Speckled Terrace after creating an ID Badge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Newly Added Controls</strong></p>
<p>The following control settings have been added to Settings in the Options menu (- Button).</p>
<ul>
<li>You may switch between enabling and disabling Auto Target Lock for Cursor.</li>
<li>You may select either the cursor or the player avatar as the center point of the whistle.
<ul>
<li>This is set to “Player Avatar” when you begin with the activity level set to “Relaxed,” but this may be changed at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may now select either “Normal” or “Precise” for the speed of the arrow that appears when you hold down X to aim. Setting this to “Precise” will make it easier to adjust the direction of the Pikmin’s Charge and Oatchi’s Rush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the Pikmin 4 demo (Ver. 1.1.0). The demo version cannot link to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>
