<p>"Just two months to go"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix locked in an October release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> earlier this year, and if you've been wanting an update about how it's progressing, it's now gone gold!</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest">Dragon Quest</a> social media account <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1961625174115295508">shared a photo</a> of remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka alongside industry legend and "father of Dragon Quest", Yuji Horii. The team has also taken the time to remind everyone how there's now "just two months to go" until this anticipated release arrives.</p>

<p>The pair actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-officially-gone-gold-out-this-november">took a similar snap</a> when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> went gold on Switch and other platforms in September 2024.</p>
<p>While this might not seem like much to be excited about, for the developers behind upcoming releases, going gold means main development is complete and ready for the production phase. Of course, teams can still make smaller improvements before launch, and then there's post-launch support <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">in the form of updates</a> and DLC. This kind of news can also be another reassuring sign that everything is still on track.</p>
<p>When Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake does launch for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, fans will need to buy the game on the Nintendo platform of their choice, as Square Enix has already confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there's no upgrade path currently planned</a>. Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes can only be used with this particular version of the game (the same applies to the Switch release).</p>

<p>Keep on rollin'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last February, you might recall how our retro-focused sibling site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3d-platformer-rollin-rascal-is-a-colourful-love-letter-to-sonic?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlighted a new high-speed game called <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rollin_rascal">Rollin' Rascal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiomatic/rollin-rascal">this Kickstarter project</a> (drawing inspiration from 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic</a> platformers and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a>) had just reached its Nintendo Switch goal, and now, well over a year later, the development team Curiomatic has revealed the title will be coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This information was shared during the developer's recent Direct-style video presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal will be released on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the original Switch version was a stretch goal, the developer further notes how the console ports (in general) will begin production once the full game is complete.</p>
<p>There's no set release date for this title just yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2740750/Rollin_Rascal/">a demo is currently available on Steam</a>, and the team plans to roll out the game's story mode in chapters, starting with the first chapter "early next year". As for the full launch, according to the Kickstarter page, it's estimated to be delivered at some point in June 2026.</p>
<p>Here's a description detailing what exactly you can expect, and the rundown video above goes into the latest development updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal is a love letter to high-speed 3D platformers like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> with the dynamic interactivity of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Strap in for a thrilling ride filled with speed, excitement, and a cast of endearing characters—an experience that’ll delight classic speedster fans, while also introducing newcomers to the genre!"</p>
