<p>What the 4K?</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9299fed9e4f4b/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember all of the confusion around whether the Switch 2 supports VRR? One moment, it did both docked and handheld, before Nintendo started removing wording surrounding docked VRR from websites and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">then apologised "for the error"</a>.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz">The Verge</a> (paywalled) has made an interesting discovery — the Switch 2's dock <em>does</em> support VRR, but it doesn't work with the Switch 2 itself. How did editor Sean Hollister find this out? By taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/">SteamDeck subreddit</a> and plugging a Steam Deck into the dock. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Using a USB-C male-to-female extension cable, you can plug your Steam Deck directly into the Switch 2's Dock, where the option to enable VRR will pop up. So if you really want to, you can play your Steam Deck games at 4K and 120fps this way.</p>

<p>Other handhelds tested include Lenovo Legion Go S using SteamOS, and the Asus ROG Ally X using the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">BazziteOS</a>, another Linux-based operating system. And rather than just relying on the menu, Hollister did use an open-source VRR testing tool. So we're all good.</p>
<p>So it begs the question — why the heck is Nintendo not taking advantage of this? It could be that the company wants to do more testing before issuing a firmware update later down the line. We're not going to know the answer, basically.</p>
<p>And hey, at least VRR <em>is</em> readily available undocked.</p>
<p><em>Have you tried plugging your handheld PC into your Switch 2 dock? Do you want to see VRR support enabled on Switch 2 while docked? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>His appointment "could lead to an interesting future"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shigeru Miyamoto E3 2015 dolls" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cadad5db1bad/shigeru-miyamoto-e3-2015-dolls.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto has spoken about the appointment of Nintendo's newest outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya, director of the Japanese doll company <a href="https://global.petworks.store/">PetWORKS</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto addressed a question on the increased number of outside directors "with diverse backgrounds", including Illumination CEO and <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> co-producer Chris Meledandri and Hachiya-san, who was revealed to be joining as a member of the board <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-appoints-doll-company-executive-as-a-new-outside-director">back in May</a>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya is a media artist who is active beyond the framework of games, and I have known<br>
him personally for a long time", says Miyamoto, revealing a connection between Hachiya and Nintendo through their relationship.</p>
<p>Miyamoto says he's been "discussing" the backgrounds of all the outside directors with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa and that the two "have been exploring various possibilities".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya engages in unconventional activities, such as researching video games and building his own equipment. We believe that a connection between Mr. Hachiya and our company could lead to an interesting future, which is why we wanted him to join us as an outside director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto's not wrong about Hachiya's background, which we covered briefly back when the artist was appointed. Does Miyamoto's vague answer hint at some art collaboration or Nintendo-themed dolls? Or something beyond that? We probably won't find out for a good while, anyhow.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/convocation_notice2506e.pdf">Convocation Notice of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a> — which is essentially an invite to the annual meeting and details the board members and the agenda — Hachiya is described as having "a wide range of achievements", which include art created by using digital tech and developing an email client.</p>
<div><p>He's also served in multiple key positions at Tokyo University of the Arts, where he is currently a professor in the Department of Intermedia Art and director of the Art Media Center. Nintendo believes that Hachiya will bring valuable experience and be able to supervise "based on his broad experience and insight in the field of art, and as a software developer and business executive".</p><p>

Essentially, we have <em>no</em> idea what this collaboration will bring about, but we're excited to see what Kazuhiko Hachiya can bring to the table.</p></div>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Hachiya's appointment in the comments</em>.</p>

<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c31be0e4dd2d4/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 brought with it something we'd dreamt about on the original Switch: GameCube games on NSO.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">the new GC controller</a> giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> that authentic feeling (while also adding wireless without a WaveBird and sneaking in some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-gyro-and-a-better-d-pad">gyro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-using-a-gamecube-controller-with-the-nso-app-yields-fun-surprises">other neat features</a>, too), we've been having a great time with the four available games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation-apparently-has-underlying-issues-nintendo-desperately-needs-to-fix">Some emulation teething issues</a> aside, we haven't run into anything like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/10/nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-games-need-some-work">the problems of the N64 app at launch</a>, and we're dead excited for the upcoming lineup. Have you seen the secondhand price of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> these days!?</p>
<p>However, with the Switch 1 libraries we've accumulated over eight years, plus the larger sizes of Switch 2 games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is 59.4GB, for instance) and a paucity of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">'proper' physical game card releases</a>, storage space is at a premium - even if you've added more to the internal 256GB with a micro SD Express card.</p>
<p>Even with a pricey 1TB card, though, I couldn't get all my games on the system. Having to pick and choose what I take with me is a necessity now. Now, compared to a monster like Cyberpunk (or the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>, which will apparently weigh in at 73.2GB), the 6GB that the GameCube app currently asks for is small potatoes. The addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> this week bumped the overall download up from 5.1GB, so the situation isn't dire just yet.</p>
<p>The GameCube's cute little discs could hold nearly 1.5GB of data, so even accounting for any jiggery-pokery from Nintendo or repackaging of the ROMs, individual games aren't likely to be larger than that (most, like Strikers, will be much smaller).</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd8c962d75bb5/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some games came on two discs, of course, though I'd say the chances of seeing this one on NSO are slim — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But on a handheld console where every gigabyte counts, the option to pick and choose the ISOs we want to take with us would be appreciated. As the library grows (it's currently at four, with six further games announced), so too will that app. And while the quality of the games so far is impressive, as with the other NSO retro apps, there are some games that you're just not going to play, for whatever reason. When the entire Game Boy offering takes up just 134MB, that's fine, but we could be saving valuable gigabytes with these GameCube games.</p>
<p>There's something to be said for having the entire library with you. There's always a chance you might discover a game you wouldn't have given the time of day otherwise, and having instant access to the lot <em>is</em> fantastic. But when my menu screen is filled with download bars flashing a little 'X' in the middle, something's got to give. It ain't gonna be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but the memory cost of having that with me at all times is going to increase every month.</p>
<p>And if we dare to dream that Wii games might one day get their own Nintendo Classics app, the sizes are only going to get bigger. Whether there's a genuine chance of Wii games ever coming to Switch 2 is a topic for another day, but the fact is that some of us would love to have a little more control over exactly what's on our systems.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you like to be able to leave Wind Waker on the virtual shelf to make space for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wave_race_blue_storm">Wave Race</a> (which surely must be coming, right?!)? Download an <em>extra</em> copy of F-Zero, perhaps - just in case? Let's get a handle on it in the poll below.</p>
