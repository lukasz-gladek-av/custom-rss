<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159445/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>11 (!) years ago, a bunch of ex-Rare staff formed a studio called Playtonic to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> that promised to skillfully carry the 3D platforming torch. Yet when the actual game launched in 2017, following an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign, it didn’t <em>fully</em> deliver on that promise.</p>
<p>Players were met with a passionately crafted, but somewhat janky experience that some (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">like me</a>) loved and others hated, and the cool reception resulted in the titular duo having a mixed reputation. Now, Playtonic has decided to make things right with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, and I’m happy to report that the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that original promise.</p>
<p>First off, what exactly <em>is</em> Yooka-Replaylee? Though it’s debatable whether this qualifies as a full-blown remake of the original, it’s immediately apparent that this goes far beyond a mere remaster that simply improves performance and visuals.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yooka-Laylee was the epitome of a flawed gem, and Playtonic clearly took to heart the criticism the initial release received and used it to make this second pass a much stronger showing. Things like tighter controls, fast travel, a map, and loads more collectibles change up the gameplay experience in some important and very positive ways, rounding off those rougher edges that caused some players to bounce off the original.</p>
<p>The overall structure remains unchanged, as the titular duo explores the central hub and its five worlds in search of dozens of Pagies, a certain number of which is needed to unlock the next world in the progression. Once you drop into a world, there are around 50 Pagies scattered around the environment to collect, which can be picked up in whatever order you want.</p>
<p>Exploration is expedited and a lot smoother this time around because our heroes have not only had their moveset retooled to feel much smoother, but also have all their abilities unlocked from the beginning. The devs also more than doubled the Pagie count for this release, which has gone a <em>long</em> way towards making the worlds feel less empty. The environments are still pretty spacious, however, especially given that they’re now by default in their ‘expanded’ state.</p>

<p>To make them feel less daunting, Playtonic added a cute bookmark NPC named Mark who you can not only fast travel to at various points on the map, but also pay to reveal the location of Pagies you haven’t found yet. I wasn’t exactly disappointed by the design and depth of the worlds in the initial release, but the work Playtonic has done here to streamline traversal and progression through them has absolutely changed them for the better.</p>
<p>In addition to Pagies, there are also oodles of coins and quills scattered in each level. The former can be traded to Vendi in exchange for equippable Tonics that modify difficulty settings and myriad cosmetic changes, while the latter can be traded to Trowser for things like energy and Tonic slot upgrades to make the protagonists a bit more durable.</p>
<p>Overall, I was really pleased at how thoughtfully they balanced the economy here - even finding these ‘currency’ collectibles feels exciting due to the sheer variety of stuff you can purchase.</p>
<p>Taking a step back and seeing all these gameplay changes really puts into perspective how much effort Playtonic put in to polish and improve their debut release. Yooka-Laylee was never a bad game, but it had some quirks and flaws that occasionally got in the way of the fun, and just about every one of those drawbacks has been modified or addressed in some way here.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it argued that Playtonic would’ve been better served putting such effort into a true sequel, but I’d say that the changes here bring this duo’s first 3D entry up to par (in terms of quality) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yooka-laylee_and_the_impossible_lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>. A lush, real-life orchestral recording of the original soundtrack only adds to that feeling of quality.</p>
<p>As far as the visuals are concerned, Yooka-Replaylee is a clear improvement on its predecessor but a little less so with this Switch 2 port. The good news is that the environments feature much richer detail and better lighting, giving them a far more vibrant and alluring atmosphere compared to the occasionally flat presentation of the original.</p>
<p>The bad news? The frame rate is capped at a disappointing (but stable) 30fps, which can make the action look a little bit choppy at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">The devs have said</a> they’re looking into a potential post-launch performance boost after "limited time" with the Switch 2 dev kits restricted their ability to design for it, but right now it's still up in the air whether that patch will ever materialise.</p>

<p>I also encountered a few bugs on my playthrough that ranged from amusing to annoying. After leaving the Switch 2 in sleep mode for a few hours, I returned to the game to find that there was no sound and after about 10 minutes of playing without it, the game simply crashed and I was booted back to the Home Screen. In another instance, whacking a treasure chest next to a wall caused my duo to clip through the level geometry and tumble into a formless black void, never to return.</p>
<p>Hiccups like this weren’t <em>too</em> common in my experience, but they also weren’t exactly uncommon, either. I'm hoping the team will address these at some point after launch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee, in most ways, feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be. The core experience has remained the same, but much has been added or tweaked to make for a significantly more confident and streamlined experience.</p>
<p>Though the technical issues hold it back a bit, at least on Switch 2 at launch, this is still a clear improvement over the original and a game that no fan of the 3D platforming genre should miss out on. Even if you played the original to completion, I’d say Yooka-Replaylee is still very much worth your time and money.</p></section>

<p>If it's more than two, you're in the minority</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fdc468f0f0474"><a title="Misc. Switch Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdc468f0f0474/misc-switch-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a die-hard Nintendo fan (and, if you find yourself here, then you probably are), you've more than likely questioned whether you're buying too many games. It's a thought that's crossed all of our minds, and new <a href="https://www.circana.com/">Circana</a> data suggests that if it's any more than two a year, then you're in the minority (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-buy-more-than-two-new-games-a-year-youre-in-the-minority-new-report-reveals">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The analyst firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">Mat Piscatella</a> recently took to Bluesky with the findings of the Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, which shows that 33% of gamers in the US pick up a new video game less than once a year. 12% of voters stated that they buy one roughly once a year, and 18% claimed to buy about one every six months.</p>
<p>What that means is that roughly 63% of gamers in the US buy less than two new games every year, so if you tend to buy more than that, you're in the minority.</p>
<p>"Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space", Piscatella noted of the findings. Interestingly, only 4% of voters said they buy more than one new game a month, with 10% opting for the 'once a month' slot, and 22% landing in 'About once every three months'.</p>

<p>Of course, the tendency to buy fewer games is hardly surprising. Since the Switch 2 launched, we've seen first-party titles get up into the reaches of £74.99 / $79.99, and with the price of <em>everything</em> on the rise, it makes sense that monthly pick-ups would take a step back. Throw in the rise of free-to-play titles and it's not hard to see how a trend could start.</p>
<p>But it got us thinking, where do you fall in this bracket? Are you like the majority of players in the US, where new game pick-ups are a rarity, or are you one of the ""Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" that Piscatella mentions, for whom new purchases are commonplace?</p>
<p>We'd imagine that most of us would sit closer to the latter (you've made it to the bottom of a post on <em>Nintendo</em> Life, so more than a passing interest in games seems likely), but there's only one way to find out... a poll! You can let us know your game purchasing habits below.</p>

<p>Available later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has announced a new event for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, introducing a special collaboration with <strong>Banshee's Last Cry</strong>, the obscure Super Famicom visual novel from 1994.</p>
<p>Players can access the new content via the World Tour mode by selecting the 'Street Fighter's Last Cry' option from the 'One Fateful Day' menu. What's even better is that this new content will seemingly be a permanent addition, and will be available even after the collab period ends.</p>
<p>Those who do join in the fun during the official period, however, will be able to bag exclusive items relating to the collaboration. That period is <strong>15th - 30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, we've got some spooky scenes with accompanying text to pay homage to the original Banshee's Last Cry, while the character models are also heavily influenced by the basic, blue design from the 1994 game.</p>
<p>It's a weird little addition, but we'll take it!</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 will also gain a new character in the form of C.Viper later this month as part of the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass. Alex and Ingrid will also join the ranks at a later date.</p>

<p>Starseekers Unite!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've already had a very brief glimpse of System Era Softworks and Devolver Digital's rather excellent-looking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker Astroneer Expeditions</a> during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Switch 2 Direct</a> six months back, and now the game has gone and got itself a great big 17-minute gameplay reveal, so we can get a proper look at exactly what it entails.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal video in full above, and following on from our initial excitement at what we gleaned from our first glance back in April (no thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/devolvers-awesome-new-games-got-lost-during-the-dodgy-switch-2-livestream">livestream hiccups</a>), this in-depth peek shows off a multiplayer space adventure that's got real promise.</p>
<p>The hook in Starseeker, you see, is all about getting together with other players, kicking off aboard the titular Starseeker ship before getting ready to drop out onto alien planets where, we assume, death dressed as many varieties of interstellar comedy awaits.</p>
<p>Of course, being a sequel to the also-very-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astroneer">Astroneer</a>, the game keeps the series' signature graphical style, although it does seem to have a lot more detail overall in the footage on show. We're also getting some heavy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/journey_to_the_savage_planet">Savage Planet</a> vibes from the colourful and goofy look of the planets on which players bound around and zap stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some further information about all of the gameplay aspects that you can check out in the vid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recruits begin their journey on the ESS Starseeker, an experimental space station packed with tools, supplies and the questionable leadership of the famous Action Science Hero superteam, the Fronteer Force. Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger cooperative missions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider our phasers officially set to "very interested indeed" as we await this one's 2026 release date on Switch 2.</p>
