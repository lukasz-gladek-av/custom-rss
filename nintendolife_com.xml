<p>"The fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5761921612aa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the Switch 2's launch last week, Nintendo has now officially confirmed its new hybrid hardware has sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days.</p>
<p>The system debuted on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> and this figure happens to make it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em> in the first four days.</p>
<p>This follows the recent news about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">annihilating the competition in the UK</a> with the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the same day. Other reports suggest the new system has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-is-already-breaking-sales-records-in-france">sold incredibly well in locations like France</a> and Spain.</p>
<p>So that's again "over" 3.5 million units and counting. According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">official Nintendo data</a>, the original Switch is currently sitting at 152 million units after an eight-year run. Other platforms like the Wii U and GameCube shifted 13 million and 21 million units respectively during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World appears to be the go-to launch title for the Switch 2 (and has even been bundled as part of a slightly more expensive Switch 2 package), so it will be interesting to see how many sales it's made from the new hardware release.</p>
<p>Based on Nintendo's information here, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad notes how this technically makes the Switch 2 the "<a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932629946834563455">fastest selling home video game console of all time</a>".</p>

<p>Sonic experts are on the case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week, SEGA unveiled the first batch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> guest characters. This includes not only characters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hatsune_miku_project_diva_mega_mix">Hatsune Miku</a> but also Steve, Alex and Creeper from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. There are some other supposed leaks still doing the rounds as well.</p>
<p>Now, the official Sonic social media account has sent Sonic fans into a frenzy once again, with a new piece of artwork apparently featuring a very familiar-looking symbol. The focus here is on what looks exactly like the Triforce from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before anyone gets excited here, no – it's <em>probably</em> not what you might be thinking. Some <a href="https://x.com/Fantactx/status/1932073396486947161">Sonic fans</a> <a href="https://x.com/NoahAFS/status/1931403746895880421">are convinced</a> the character Espio (who is a ninja) and the symbol are linked, and this is more likely to be a reference to Japan's Hōjō clan. Others acknowledge how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1l7n72x/so_why_is_the_triforce_in_an_official_sonic/">similar patterns have featured</a> in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantactx: "It's not a teaser for Link to be in the game, it's a symbol used by the Hōjō clan back in 13th century Japan who were allies with a ninja clan which is why it's near Espio as he himself, is a ninja. A example of this being used for inspiration would be the Triforce."</p>
<p>NoahAFS: "No everyone, that's not the Triforce next to Espio, that's the symbol of the Hōjō clan, a Japanese samurai family. This does not mean Link is coming to CrossWorlds."</p>
<p>Shaddy_the_guy: "This is just a pattern that can exist, y'know. It's all over the walls in Palmtree Panic"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case closed then, or is it? Stranger crossovers have happened and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> series has even hosted some platform-exclusive characters in the past. Link's also starred in a racing game already, so why not another? And while this kind of crossover would have been unimaginable once upon a time, Sega and Nintendo maintain a great relationship nowadays.</p>
<p>So, while we're not completely ruling anything out here (<em>at least for now</em>), we wouldn't suggest you get your hopes up. In some other Sonic Racing news, Sega has confirmed there'll be a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, along with a paid upgrade.</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you like to see any guests from certain Nintendo franchises feature in Sonic?

<p>Home Sweet Home</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> is returning to the Switch next month with two 3DS games, but it looks like there could be even more on the way.</p>
<p>According to a new rating that's popped up in Taiwan, the mobile game <strong>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home 'Deluxe Edition'</strong> is making its way across to the Switch and PlayStation 5. As mentioned by Gematsu, this game originally made its debut on iOS and Android devices in August 2024.</p>
<p>It's developed by Appci, published by Natsume, and is described as being the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices. In this entry, you'll "woo a variety of bachelors and bachelorettes, marry whomever your heart desires", harvest crops, care for animals, fish, mine, and much more.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You can also get involved in various contests and festivals while collecting and gathering to grow the village and get more residents. Here's an official description from the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Head back to your roots and leave the city life for your childhood village of Alba in Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home, where the freshest fish and tastiest veggies are grown and caught by the local farmers and anglers!</p>
<p>"However, with its population getting older and younger villagers leaving for the big city, Alba Village has seen better days, so can you help turn it from a village on the decline to one of prosperity? With its beautiful surroundings, Alba definitely has the potential, so work hard to bring tourists and even new residents to this sprawling green village! Reunite with your childhood friend and other familiar faces to help put Alba on the map!"</p>
