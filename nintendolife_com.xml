<p>It's been...well...it's been a year in which we have all existed, that's for sure, and as a result games happened. Loads of them, in fact. Of course, and as is tradition at this time of year (it's Christmas, mate, wake up), you've got your usual shoe-ins for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-of-2025">Game of the Year</a>, your fancy writing awards, nice acting, and good gameplay nods. All that stuff and nonsense for people who do everything right all the time.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>However, and as anyone who's drunk as much festive sherry as we have over the years will tell you, there are many more games worthy of a mention in any given year when you broaden your horizons ever-so-slightly. Who needs the pomp and circumstance of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, for example, when you've got the guns and squirrels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>? That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say what follows is in any way less prestigious, mind you. We've got some absolute bangers in here. It's just that some good games come at you from unexpected angles. Y'know. Like those wee Christmas vol-au-vents. You just never see them coming.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, and before these delicious flaky pastries go cold, let's dig into our 2025 Alternative Award choices. <em>Regarde!</em></p>

<h2 id="nintendo-lifes-alternative-awards-2025">Nintendo Life's Alternative Awards 2025</h2>
<h3 id="best-game-we-wish-we-liked-more-2025">Best 'Game We Wish We Liked More' 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="073b3de12a895"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/073b3de12a895/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion was announced for Switch 2, this particular writer couldn't quite contain their excitement. The reason? Well, it seemed as though this sequel to a super-solid predecessor was going to give early Switch 2 adopters exactly what they wanted to see on a new console. Huge big open worlds, high-octane robot fights, and all the other sorts of things that made the original Switch crap itself.</p>
<p>In the end, and as you can read about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">in more depth in our review</a>, what we got was a very good game at its core, but one that just didn't satisfy when it came to performance at all. This 30fps effort stuttered too much, it's too janky overall, and combat that sings on other platforms feels well mushy and unsatisfying at points here as a result. A shame! There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/another-switch-2-game-has-been-updated-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">updates and fixes</a>, so there's hope yet.</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a></p>
<h3 id="best-game-featuring-a-squirrel-with-a-gun-2025">Best 'Game Featuring A Squirrel With A Gun' 2025</h3>
<p>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="fd16e4d59a2b3"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd16e4d59a2b3/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dee Dee Creations</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the tougher categories to judge, as we're sure you can imagine. <strong>*cough*</strong> This prestigious — and also very large and expensive — award goes to a bit of a left-field choice in this category. Yes, that's right, it's Dee Dee Creation's Squirrel with a Gun.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone involved in a game that sure did make this writer's children laugh a lot. They also know the names of loads of types of real-world guns and weapons now, too. LEARNING BONUS MULTIPLIER X5!</p>
<h3 id="best-retro-remake-remaster-re-release-2025">Best Retro Remake / Remaster / Re-Release 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="dce79be1cc4a9"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dce79be1cc4a9/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This very (bald) writer gave Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles a great big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">juicy 9/10 in our review</a> back at launch, and he'd do it again!</p>
<p>Yes, some folk haven't taken to the way in which some War of the Lions content was cut, but honestly we reckon the remix works better overall. Also, the extra fighting you got in War of the Lions...who really needed it? Seriously. You just had like 40 hours of top-notch combat and you're kicking up a stink for more?</p>
<p>With meaningful quality-of-life enhancements, gloriously slick visuals and performance, and CPU tweaks to make battles even better, this is the best version of one of the best FF games. So there.</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD Remake</a></p>

<figure data-uuid="5913fbd79ef1b"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5913fbd79ef1b/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Devolver Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unbelievable scenes here at the awards. Unreal stuff. We were up all night (this writer pulled all of his own hair out), but in the end the decision has been made to award Best Game Featuring A Glass Skater Whose Soul Is Chained To Their Board 2025 to...<strong>*drum roll*</strong></p>
<p>It's Skate Story! Devolver has given us another one of those games, you know the ones, like your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hotline_miami_collection">Hotline Miamis</a> and whatnot, that immediately...as soon as you start to play...you just <em>feel</em> x100 cooler. The plot (involving hell, souls, demons, glass things, skating) is exactly mad enough that you simply must know how it ends, and on this chaotic hook is then hung some supremely good skating.</p>
<p>Like, actually. The skating is great. Who knew?! We just thought it was gonna look nice, but it's got the whole lot this one. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Check out our 8/10 review</a> if you don't believe me.</p>

<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="56aa3174c373c"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56aa3174c373c/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The folks at Hello Games are no strangers to pulling off a late save and turning things around on a game (or in this case port) that looked all but out to sea. Or maybe that should be out to space or something. Something clever.</p>
<p>We loved the Switch 1 port, but No Man's Sky is a game transformed on Switch 2, now with all the bells and whistles you'll find elsewhere. And it runs good. And it looks great. It's also a game that benefits hugely from having portable mode on the table - exactly the sort of thing you can leave on your console for years and pick at during lazy periods (Mon-Fri, 9am - 5pm).</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a></p>

<p>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/labyrinth_of_the_demon_king">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="75de073047e5b"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75de073047e5b/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Top Hat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think there'd be a whole lot of competition for this one. Centipedes have long been a fundamental and core part of gaming. However, and as we can see, these modern game-makers...they just don't honour the classics amongst...eh...computer game insects?</p>
<p>Anyway. Labyrinth of the Demon King is absolutely stonking (and stinking) stuff. It's a belter. And you, my friend, should play it. It also has some great big centipedes in there. And they are poisonous. The good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="best-end-of-year-arrival-that-dropped-too-late-to-make-our-goty-list-2025">Best 'End-Of-Year Arrival That Dropped Too Late To Make Our GOTY List' 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a></strong></p>
<figure data-uuid="84527fa1d00f1"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84527fa1d00f1/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this was a shame, actually, because Despelote really is a special game - a December arrival in the US and we don't get it on European eShops until 13th January. A roughly two-hour experience, it's something we can <em>all</em> make time to play, and something we really should, too.</p>
<p>Set during the Ecuadorian team's historic 2001 World Cup qualifying campaign, this is a beautiful thing to just lose yourself in for a single sitting, and it's also the sort of game (given the running time especially) that you shouldn't let anyone ruin for you. So no spoilers here. It's a top tale told well. It's also a game that displays a deep knowledge, not just of its subject matter, but of video games and interactive stories and how they are told in a way that best conveys the emotion, alongside a time and a place that is universal to anyone who's ever been a child (that's, like, loads of people).</p>
<p>Seek it out, submit to its story and enjoy a very special thing indeed.</p>

<p>This one is terrifying for this writer because I was on reviewing duty and it's genuinely hard to believe this wasn't about two years back.</p>
<p>Regardless of how long and tiring you may or may not have found this year, one thing is for certain: it's always worth giving XCX a shout.</p>
<p>This Definitive Edition makes good on the promise of the OG, adding performance boosts and other enhancements that make for one of the best open-world games (and/or Mecha games) on Switch consoles as of writing. We're really feeling it! Still.</p>

<p>Who wants 20 more hours or thereabouts of premium-grade Chained Echoes content? We'll tell you who.</p>
<p>Me. We. We mean we do! And also, you. Perhaps. Let's forget about this sentence. Chained Echoes is one of the greats of recent times, a belter that everyone should dig into. Ashes of Elrant (and keeping it vague, so no spoilers) adds more of everything you may have loved about the main game. Hey, it's got 15 new songs in it. 15!</p>

<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> is a chirpy, cheery game. It’s lightning in a bottle, a magical experience full of joy and excitement. Yet, there are few endings as gut-wrenching as Chrono Trigger’s 'Bad' ending.</p><div><figure data-videoid="I2fL0wP73Io" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytI2fL0wP73Io" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed58d513hxyjkt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>You’ve spent hours travelling between time periods, rescuing innocent people, gathering allies, and seeing firsthand the evolution of Lavos, the cause of the apocalypse in 1999 AD and the origin of evil throughout history - throughout millions of years of history.</p>
<p>Travelling to 1999 AD and taking on Lavos right before it causes the apocalypse, only to fail, is devastating. “The future refuses to change,” and Lavos takes all life, including yours. Life and the world collapse and grey out before your very eyes. This beautiful world you’ve become acquainted with — that you’ve seen in six different times and witnessed the spirit of humanity change, adapt, grow, and evolve — is <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>But the future <em>refuses</em> to change; it’s not that it can’t. The words on the screen, in front of that greyed-out image of Earth and Lavos’ blood-curdling scream blaring out of the speakers, might feel like a gut punch, but it also serves as the fuel, the motivation, to get back in the fight to save the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0decd5dafb8dd"><a title="Chrono Trigger Lavos 1999 AD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0decd5dafb8dd/chrono-trigger-lavos-1999-ad.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you already know that, right? In the 30 years since its release, everything that can be said about Chrono Trigger has been said. You don’t have to accept the world as it is. Pursue your dreams. Fight for change. You can’t change everything, but you can change some things.</p>
<p>Where many time travel stories are cautionary tales that preach the dangers of changing the course of history, Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s message is poignant and, importantly, timeless. Things are crap right now, and I can’t really get through a day without feeling like the world is going to collapse in some way. If I had my own Epoch, I’d hop in it right now, travel through time, and do something to change the future. That’s what Crono, Marle, Lucca, and friends did. All because they love the world, and they love the people in it. And I do, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s depiction of Earth is special, and it does something that very few RPGs manage to achieve – it makes its setting a character through its use of time travel. Over the course of millions of years, you get to: experience a <a href="https://www.snesmaps.com/maps/ChronoTrigger/ChronoTriggerMapSelect.html">world’s make-up physically changing</a>; spot similarities between continental shapes and town locations; see where certain islands have fused together, broken up, or even been completely wiped off of the map. The further you get through the game, the more similarities you’ll spot.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s obvious when you compare 600 AD and 1000 AD. The Middle Ages and Present Day only have a gap of 400 years to contend with, and many locations are in the exact same places. Truce, Guardia Forest, Porre, the Hero’s Grave, and a few other places have barely changed, and even where islands have merged, their locations match. The Sun Shrine is present in every single time period. Even the Tyranno Lair’s reappearance in the Middle Ages (as the Giant’s Claw), after millions of years, hammers home the importance of the world.</p>

<p>There are smaller details in all of the maps, too. The mountain range behind the Dactyl’s Nest in 65,000,000 BC remains all throughout history, even if it changes. Of course it would; rain, weather, and even human influence would erode the natural structures. The Ice Age alone seems to have created a more jagged range of mountains, compared to the lush green plateau of the nest millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Traditions have even survived Earth’s turbulent history, just as in real life. Ioka Village is home to a small festival where the people dance. Crono, upon visiting the village, is challenged to a soup-chugging contest by Ayla, the chief. This is in 65,000,000 BC. At the beginning of the game, in 1000 AD, Crono can take part in a prehistoric dancing game at the Millennial Fair. He can also imbibe in a drinking contest – not as safe as soup-chugging, kids, don’t try that one at home.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too. The events of 12,000 BC and the collapse of Zeal more than amplify that message. Because of Queen Zeal and the (aptly named) Mammon Machine — because she tried to <em>use</em> Lavos — humanity’s innate ability to use magic was lost to time.</p>
<p>There are people that want to correct that mistake, like Melchior, one of the three Gurus and the architect behind the Mammon Machine. He warned Queen Zeal of the dangers of using Lavos’ power, but was thrust forward to 1000 AD. He <em>wants</em> to change 'history' – Antiquity’s future, the Present Day’s past, and the apocalyptic future of 2300 AD.</p>

<p>Even Chrono Trigger sets limits to what you can and can’t affect, though. You can destroy Lavos at the Ocean Palace in 12,000 BC – probably not until a second playthrough, mind you. But doing that doesn’t <em>change</em> the future, it just thrusts you back to the End of Time where Gaspar, another of the three Gurus, resides, and allows you to talk to the staff who worked on the game.</p>

<p>Defeating Lavos before killing the Black Tyranno doesn’t really change much besides two things: Lavos is dead, obviously; and, oh, everyone is a reptite now and forever – they never died out in this timeline. Otherwise, everything’s largely the same. In another ending, if you defeat Lavos while Crono is dead, then eventually Gaspar will intervene in the celebrations and insist that there’s still a way to revive Crono. There are many good and bad constants in <em>all</em> of these timelines, things that the party doesn’t have the power to change.</p>

<p>But it’s also not fair to call catastrophic events like the summoning of Lavos in 12,000 BC, or Magus’ attempt to summon the creature again in 600 AD, a blip in the timeline, because of the suffering those events inflict. History can be painful, and things that happen in the past ripple. We feel the after-effects of events from over one hundred years ago; they wound people, physically and mentally, and can alter paths. All we can do is bear the sins of the past and do something with that information, to change the future.</p>

<p>It’s that undercurrent of history's weight and the power of change that makes storylines like Fiona’s resonate so strongly. Despite only being a sidequest, how important it is to change the 'little' things has stuck with me, too. Restoring a forest might seem like nothing in the grand scheme, but to Fiona, it’s everything. And to you, who has seen firsthand what happens, you want to give that one person a spark of hope. You have to go back, convince someone to plant a seed, defeat the monsters in the Sunken Desert, then have Robo stay and water and care for the forest.</p>

<p>In the present day, you can see the fruits of your labour at Fiona’s Forest, a beautiful, lush woodland which is home to the game’s timeless campfire scene, and is an example of Crono, Robo, and the others giving back. It’s a small, positive change, and a beacon of hope. If we can do this one little thing, perhaps we can make a difference. Because we love this world, and we can make those ripples more beautiful, more positive. We <em>can</em> change the future.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s world is what sets it apart from almost every other RPG. It’s small, but we become intimately familiar with it. Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for: a better future.</p>
<p>Yet even in the face of the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger can make time for a joke or two. It stands as a beacon of light against tyranny and evil, and its message resonates now more than ever before. Instead of “The future refused to change”, consider the words of a random nun in the Middle Ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In our world, every storm has an end. Every night has a new morning. What's important is to trust those you love, and never give up. We must all keep hope alive…”</em></p>
