<p>A new adventure through "space, time, and the streets of Toronto"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Pilgrim EX</strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>

<p>Four more fighters are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the release of Elena as well as the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, Capcom has now lifted the lid on the Year 3 paid DLC roster.</p>
<p>It's revealed the next batch of characters with the help of pro wrestler Kenny Omega who has starred in an amusing cinematic trailer. Here's the characters you can expect in the next season:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sagat - Summer 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>C. Viper - Autumn 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alex - Early Spring 2026</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ingrid - Late Spring 2026</strong><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, if you want to give Street Fighter 6 a go on the Switch 2, there's a free demo you can download from the eShop. It gives you access to the World Tour mode, along with the verse mode (including Gyro control matches).</p>
<p>Our review for Street Fighter 6 has also gone live, if you're interested in finding out more about how the game runs on the Switch 2:</p>

<p>Another year, another Geoff</p>
</section></header><section>
<p>Okay, okay, we know you're incredibly busy right now playing the Switch 2. We understand, and it's all good.</p>
<p><em>However</em>. If you're interested in what this year's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase has to offer, then you've come to the right place. We're streaming the event live right here when it all kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PDT / 3pm MDT / 4pm CDT / 5pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CEST / 12am (Sat) EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 6am (Sat) JST / 5am (Sat) AWST / 7am (Sat) AEST</li></ul>

<p>As for what might be announced, well... we don't really know right now. A lot of focus seems to be on Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> for the PS5, so we're fully expecting Geoff Keighley and Kojima to spend a good 10-15 minutes doing some sort of secret handshake on-stage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a whole bunch of partners has been confirmed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-switch-2-listed-as-a-summer-game-fest-2025-partner">including 'Nintendo Switch 2'</a>, so it's likely we'll see a few notable announcements for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>So grab a snack, settle in, and enjoy... Or go back to playing Switch 2, whatever you want.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design.1210611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Pro Controller 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37abd35a25ad0/pro-controller-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Moving from the Switch 1 Pro Controller to the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Nintendo has largely taken the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ route. Keeping the same basic layout intact, it instead applied several small, but significant improvements to make this latest iteration the very best Nintendo controller I’ve ever had the pleasure of using.</p>
<p>So, looking at the design of the new pad, it all looks pretty familiar, but there are a few changes that should be noted.</p>
<p>For starters, the grips are ever-so-slightly slimmer than the previous model, which in my case made it much more comfortable in the hand. My index fingers rest perfectly on the ‘ZL’ and ‘ZR’ triggers, while the rest of my fingers fall naturally on the grips below. As for the general feel, the matt black/grey finish is wonderful, though it does invite plenty of dust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the face buttons have been slightly enlarged; not so much that it’s immediately noticeable by sight, but you can really feel the difference in the hand. They’re close enough together that your thumb essentially rests on two buttons at once diagonally, making it easy to rock back and forth to hit whichever one you want.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest improvement comes with those analogue sticks. Good <em>lord</em>, they feel incredible. The standard Joy-Con controllers have been improved in a similar way, with the sticks feeling much smoother than on the Switch 1. With the Pro Controller, this is far more pronounced thanks to the extra travel afforded by the larger sticks.</p>
<p>It’s so difficult to describe exactly how smooth the motion feels; it’s one of those things where if you know, you <em>know</em>. That said, if you want a bit of a fun attempt at a rundown, then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olJH2tQgREE">Alex’s video</a>, in which he demonstrates with a bottle and an oily spoon. (Look, just trust me). Rest assured, the slight grinding you'd feel on the original Pro Controller is now completely gone.</p>
<p>Moving onto the D-pad, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/18ztfbf/holy_crap_the_pro_controllers_dpad_is_horrible/">sensitivity issues some people had</a> with the Switch 1 Pro Controller appear to have been fixed here, though we’ll need to really put it through its paces over the coming months (and years) to see if it holds up.</p>

<p>Testing the D-pad within the calibration settings reveals that rocking it up and down while holding down left or right does still yield ‘up’ and ‘down’ inputs, but it’s not nearly as sensitive as the previous controller. In fact, you want it to happen a <em>bit</em> so you can easily pull off diagonal inputs. Playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was easily able to knock out a few combos and Hadoukens without any fuss, and retro games via Nintendo Switch Online felt similarly natural with the D-pad.</p>
<p>Over on the back, you’ve also got the new ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons, which can be remapped to whatever you wish on a game-by-game basis. We’ve already noted that you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-got-a-switch-2-pro-controller-this-little-capture-trick-is-a-game-changer">map the capture button to the back</a>, which is a bit of a game-changer for more fast-paced games in which you want to take a few snaps.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can map whatever input you wish, so it can certainly come in handy when you want to sprint and jump at the same time in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, for example.</p>
<figure><a title="Pro Controller 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8798e564fe271/pro-controller-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The positioning of the back buttons feels pretty natural, too. I mentioned that my fingers rested comfortably on the grips, and this is exactly where ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ are placed, but if you’re worried about accidentally pressing them, fear not. You can comfortably move your middle fingers up slightly to rest on the back of the pad – pretty much right where the ‘Nintendo’ logo is located. But even this isn’t entirely necessary in my opinion; my fingers curve around the buttons enough that I don’t feel they’re ever going to be pressed unless I consciously want to.</p>
<p>The dinky face buttons — i.e. your home button, capture button, '+', '–', and GameChat button — are all tucked away quite neatly in the middle of the device. The capture button specifically could be in a <em>slightly</em> easier-to-reach location, but it's at least out of the way enough that you're probably never going to hit it accidentally.</p>
<p>With the 'C' button, it's the same deal. You know where it is, so it's easily reachable whenever you want to access the Switch 2's GameChat menu, but you need to consciously reach your thumb over to get at it. What's odd is that, thanks to the right analogue stick next to it, the GameChat button looks slightly off-centre. It's not — you can tell by looking at its positioning in relation to the home and capture buttons above — but next to the analogue stick, it looks a little... weird.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the other big change with the Pro Controller 2 is the addition of a 3.5mm headphone jack - can I get a 'hallelujah!'? Yes, this is a lovely little addition that makes discreet audio an absolute breeze if you happen to be gaming late at night. Something to keep in mind is that you'll need to make sure your controller is fully updated before hooking up a headset - thankfully, the Switch itself lets you know that you're due one if you plug anything into the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Positioning the audio jack at the bottom is just about the best place for it, too. You've got a standard USB-C slot at the top for your charging needs, so you can easily plug in both a headset and a charging cable without much fuss.</p>
<p>Speaking of the top, you'll notice now that the entire area housing the shoulder buttons, USB-C slot, and sync button is now white, as are the 'shafts' for the analogue sticks. This is a nice little design decision that easily sets the new pad apart from its predecessor, but I can also understand if it doesn't appeal to those looking for a more uniform look.</p>
<p>As for the shoulder buttons themselves, these feel nice and clicky without producing too much noise. No analogue functionality for the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons, sadly, but the digital inputs work perfectly well enough. Truth be told, this is probably the one area of the pad that's required the least amount of tinkering from Nintendo, and it all feels just as good as ever.</p>

<p>One last thing to touch on is the HD Rumble 2, which definitely feels a lot more robust than the original Pro Controller (and quieter too), but still not quite on par with the PS5's haptic feedback. It feels really nice, though; moving between menu options on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> produces small, yet welcome feedback, while powersliding during races feels appropriately gnarly without distracting you from the action on-screen.</p>
<p>Really, it's hard to find much fault with it. Time will be the true test, of course, and it certainly isn't cheap. I'll be keeping a close eye on any potential drifting issues or D-pad shenanigans, but after using it as my primary controller for 99% of the time with my Switch 2 thus far, it's proven to be a magical little accessory; a new benchmark in Nintendo controller design. I've not yet tried the PS5's DualSense Edge, but I feel confident in saying that this $85 pad feels better than Xbox's $200 Elite Controller.</p>

<p>Worth the purchase, definitely</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Wind Waker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fb262cb808a5f/wind-waker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest surprises with the Switch 2 is the bonus addition of Nintendo GameCube games for subscribers to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The opening line-up is slightly slim, sure, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> are all absolute bangers.</p>
<p>Some of you may have also picked up the new wireless GameCube controller to go with your new subscriber perk, and it's definitely an incredibly faithful recreation of the original classic. Like previous NSO catalogues, however, using the GameCube controller yields a few fun surprises in the main menu, as seen in the below video from Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akfamilyhome.com/post/3lqukwcsb5c2e">AK</a>.</p>

<p>So when using the controller, the usual red interface will change to purple to match the overall colour scheme of the GameCube, while a bunch of sound effects have also been added in. There are definitely a few we've noticed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It's a neat little easter egg, albeit one that's been done before. Still, it's pretty cool to see that Nintendo still has its sense of fun, even if this isn't immediately apparent with the main Switch 2 UI.</p>
