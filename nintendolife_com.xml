<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fe7b5293e580/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some poor sod over at Nintendo recently made a pretty hefty mistake in creating a huge poster for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> with the words "Out Now" printed very clearly for all to see.</p>
<p>Nintendo has already stated that the printing was a mistake, but now the company has now ensured that no further confusion occurs by swapping the poster out for one that merely says "2025". This was highlighted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GlitchNDaSystem/">GlitchNDaSystem</a> over on Reddit and covered by our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-no-longer-out-now-as-london-underground-advertisement-is-updated">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>We still wonder just how such a drastic blunder slipped through Nintendo's iron clad fortress and made its way onto the walls of the London Underground, but at least it's all fixed now.</p>
<p>There's still no date for the long-awaited sequel, but by process of elimination, we would probably place it quite neatly in the month of either September or November. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag X Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in August, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in October.</p>
<p>A launch in December wouldn't be completely out of the question, but it feels a little too close to the Holidays for our liking. Plus, we need to put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> somewhere, too!</p>
<p>So much to play, so little time...</p>

<figure><a title="DS2 MARIO REF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1f45ab2d49ad/ds2-mario-ref.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Kojima Productions</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, as you'll likely know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Hideo Kojima</a>'s incredibly good walking simulator, has got itself a fancy big sequel this week in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and we've been playing it in what little free time we've got (well, this writer has, at least) over on the old PlayStation side of things.</p>
<p>You'll be pleased to know that this writer has discovered some vague, possible Mario references in the second game, and it's only early days!</p>
<p>The references-of-sorts relate to some Mushroom Badges, which are available to sew onto a backpack in the game from the get-go. There a few different mushroom badges, even a triple set - just like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>! Can it be a coincidence?</p>
<p>As it turns out these Mushroom Kingdom-styled mushies, rather than just being random as all hell, are actually found in the game world of Death Stranding 2, and its predecessor, (hey, they pop up when you pee!), so it stands to reason that the badges are simply tied innocently to this whole mechanic.</p>

<p>However, we're suspect of this being entirely and purely coincidental, especially given the choice of a Fly Agaric mushroom over any of the millions of other types you could have chosen.</p>
<p>Yes, you may argue that this type of mushroom appears in lots of games, possibly way more than any other, but then you'd be kicking this theory right in the Sam Porters, which isn't very nice. Anyway, the game, as you can see from our images, calls them "Golden Toadstools", so we're still 100% behind our working theory!</p>
<p>If you've played the original Death Stranding, then this probably won't surprise you. You'll already know, possibly by way of a lot of cringing, that the game contains references to Mario and Princess Peach, with one very on the nose line in particular, as seen in the clip below (warning, it's worse than you may remember).</p>

<p>Rightio! There are many discussions online about comparisons between the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Mario and Peach</a> relationship mirroring that of the leads in Death Stranding, but we'll let you dig your own hole there.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to check back in if we find any Bullet Bill in Death Stranding 2 in the meantime.</p>
