Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Last time</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The classic SMW2 art came out on top in the end, though, with North America taking 59% of the vote, leaving the pretty Japanese variant with 41%.</p>
<p>This week, to mark the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">Virtual Boy's Nintendo Switch Online launch line-up</a>, we're taking a look at one of the titles that you'll be able to play from 17th February: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>. This <strong>Star Fox</strong>-style space shooter joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> on the service right from the jump, so it seems only right that we all become acquainted with its box art ahead of time.</p>
<p>Being a Virtual Boy title, there's obviously no European cover to look at this week, but the North American and Japanese designs make for a neat head-to-head. So, let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3793,196709 @ 1769957455 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b139dcf8dc29"><a title="Red Alarm - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b139dcf8dc29/red-alarm-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American box art is just about as bright and colourful as they come. It's packed full of action with ships, explosions, a trench run backdrop vaguely reminiscent of the Death Star, and one of those green-outline maps that you only ever find in spy thrillers. Sure, it couldn't look less like the actual game, but it does a good job of selling the experience</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a58c1fe1dc9df"><a title="Red Alarm - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a58c1fe1dc9df/red-alarm-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">T&amp;E Soft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooooh, the Japanese design goes full <strong>Top Gun</strong>. This is less about action and more about looking cool (something that's not so simple with a Virtual Boy headset strapped to your noggin). Be it the muted colour palette of blacks and reds — a more realistic image of the vibrancy you'll see in game — or the badass ship reflection in the central pilot's visor, this cover oozes cool.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting!

<p>Fancy a plant?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a whole new take on the world of Pokémon, where you'll be able to farm, grow veggies, collect resources, build things, decorate, and of course, make friends with many different Pokémon.</p>
<p>With the game scheduled to arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, more pre-order bonuses are now beginning to surface online. As highlighted by Serebii.net, the latest one is available on Amazon in the US and Best Buy in Canada.</p>
<p>If you order the game from either of these places before the release date, you'll get a download code for a 'Flat Leaf Plant' item, which can be used to decorate spaces in the game. The same bonus has been previously made available on the Amazon store in Japan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0fefb8d8c9db2"><a title="Pokémon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fefb8d8c9db2/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not planning on getting Pokémon Pokopia from these stores, you'll apparently still be able to get this plant through regular gameplay. So no trainer should miss out!</p>
<p>Once again, Pokémon Pokopia launches exclusively for the Switch 2 this March. You can see what other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-pre-order-pokemon-pokopia-for-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order offers and bonuses</a> there are in our guide here on Nintendo Life, and find out more about the game in our previous coverage.</p>
