<figure data-uuid="0dc42ab024b87"><a title="Terminator" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dc42ab024b87/terminator.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitmap Bureau</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bitmap Bureau <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed on all consoles and will now launch on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled for the end of October, the company confirmed that the delay is due to "trade and tariff changes" affecting the Day One and Collector's Editions. Not content to force physical enthusiasts to wait longer, all editions of the game have subsequently been pushed back.</p>
<p>Here's the full announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We wanted to share an important update on the release of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em>. The game will now launch on November 26, 2025.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions. Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.</p>
<p>"We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay. The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share</p>
<p>"<em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> with you all this November."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming game will be an adaptation of the classic 1991 action movie <strong>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</strong> from director James Cameron. It takes inspiration from old-school Sega Mega Drive action games and will feature several playable characters and iconic scenes from the movie.</p>

<p>In a new announcement, Evil Empire revealed that it'll be stepping behind the development wheel of Brotato while the game's initial devs, Blobfish Games, head off to focus on new projects.</p>
<p>This 'live ops' work is very similar to what we saw Evil Empire do with Dead Cells — heck, the studio was founded by former Motion Twin devs for this very reason — so we're excited to see what the team will cook up for the runnin', gunnin' potato roguelike.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmrqxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Evil Empire has said that it has no post-launch Brotato plans to reveal at the moment, though it has teased that an update will be coming our way in October featuring a new mob called 'The Gobbler'.</p>
<p>The studio shared the full Bortato statement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/evilempirestudio.bsky.social/post/3lzy6ihdh4k2a">BlueSky</a>, which you can check out below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big news: today we're feeling chipper as we're picking up Brotato!<br>
Blobfish Games has been carrying it for years, and they've done an incredible job. Now they want to make new games (which we're very excited to play), and so they're trusting us to keep Brotato alive while they do their thing. That's both an honor and a little terrifying.<br>
In case you hadn't realised already, we live and breathe roguelikes, and we've got over 6 years of 'live ops' experience that we can put to good use here. We also just genuinely love this game — there's a few of us whose 'hours played' stats are way too high... So, this means that we'll be doing what we know works best — working with the players as closely as possible to mash their ideas with ours, while we release regular content updates.<br>
We'll start sharing some broad ideas with you soon and we might just wedge in some betas in the coming months too, What you can expect is more chaos, more experiments, and maybe a few disasters along the way. That's how good games grow. And this one deserves to keep growing. Sprouting?<br>
Thank you again to Blobfish Games for your trust, we can't wait to get stuck in!<br>
PS: The first update is on its way, but you may want to update the game already for a little something something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from all the Brotato bonus content, Evil Empire will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> to Switch and Switch 2 at some point this year. This one has racked up some pretty positive reviews throughout its early access period, so it'll be interesting to see whether it lives up to the hype.</p>

<p>We'll miss you, friend</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's always difficult to say goodbye to someone, and today we bid farewell to our lovely, <em>lovely</em> video producer Zion Grassl, who is leaving Nintendo Life for pastures new.</p>
<p>Zion joined us all the way back in 2019, and helped our YouTube channel grow exponentially as we navigated the world of the Nintendo Switch. His enthusiasm and infectious passion for all things Nintendo really struck a chord with our viewers, and we're incredibly sad to see him go.</p>
<p>He leaves us with some truly incredible videos, including the hugely ambitious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsuFsGwpJgs">'I Tried 3DS StreetPass For 365 Days'</a>, the hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglKld20Hic">'The MOTHER We Share'</a> documentary, and the delightfully ridiculous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">'I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art'</a>. We simply cannot put a price on Zion's remarkable contributions to the channel, and we're certain that wherever he ends up next, he'll go on to do even greater things.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I (yes, me, Ollie) am incredibly grateful for Zion's friendship over the years. His presence during my first trip to LA for Summer Game Fest was immensely comforting, and it made the trip infinitely more enjoyable. He truly is one of the most caring, uplifting spirits you could ever hope to meet, and I'm proud to call him my friend.</p>
<p>So from me, and from all of us here at Nintendo Life, we wish Zion the very best of luck. If you want to keep up with his work, you can find him on socials under the handle @ZionDood. In the meantime, please do continue to support the wonderful work that Alex and Felix continue to do over on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nintendolife">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Love you, Zion!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159228/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a long-time fan or just curious, it’s natural to approach the release of a new JRPG with measured expectations. These games often build on rich lore and deep series history, rewarding those who enjoy exploring vast worlds and narratives. On the surface, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> might seem like just another drop in the genre ocean, especially since it belongs to <strong>The Legend of Heroes</strong>, where the Trails cycle alone spans 13 games. However, this reboot benefits from the clean narrative slate of a series opener and a generous modernisation that will appeal to fans and newcomers across the board. This may be the beginning of a long remake series, but it’s a hell of an intro.</p>
<p>The story takes place in Liberl, a technologically advanced region of a much larger world. Here we meet two siblings, who are beginning their training as freelance guardians of the land. Estelle and Joshua are engaging dual protagonists; their endearing relationship and playful bickering are the heart of the story. As they rise through the ranks of a peacekeeping force called the Bracers, they are joined by a huge cast of characters and a constantly shifting roster of party members. There are too many to list here, but aside from the Bright siblings, I was especially fond of the musical fop Oliviere (voiced by Matt Mercer in the English audio track).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159239/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Liberl feels like a living, breathing world, with bustling population centres and NPC dialogue that shifts based on the story's events. Dialogue choices offer a sense of narrative agency and it always feels worth chatting up locals when you frequent a town. In true JRPG fashion, the story takes a while to really breathe (you can easily spend a dozen hours in the prologue), but there is plenty to do from the outset, so you won’t be stuck in stop-start dialogue or endless tutorials.</p>
<p>There will be many an info screen in the opening hours, however, largely thanks to a pleasingly complex battle system. As trainee Bracers, Estelle and Joshua spend much of their time completing missions that pit them against a wide variety of monsters. Fighting the fauna of Liberl is both flexible and accessible. While the systems on offer aren’t unique, the sheer number of options available to your party keeps combat exciting.</p>
<p>Ability sets are built using a slotting system called Quartz, crafted from a material known as Sepith. These materials drop from enemies in several types, and combining them to fill gear slots unlocks different spells and abilities. Beyond quartz-based magic, your party also has a suite of melee and ranged techniques that can be chained, overcharged, and combined for devastating critical damage. Each party member has utility and can support their companions with elemental boosts.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159227/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat can play out in real time or switch to a queue-based tactical variant. Most battles will require the strategic turn-based mode, while traversing the open world is a breeze with the real-time system.</p>
<p>It takes some time to get comfortable with the options at your disposal, but once it all clicks the fighting is a blast. For anyone familiar with the series, these mechanics are a mix of ideas from earlier entries, which is just part of the modern overhaul this remake provides.</p>
<p>Falcom’s update shifts the perspective away from an isometric, polygonal style to a fully animated 3D Liberl. The world is bright and colourful, while combat feels fluid and looks spectacular. The industry may currently lean in favour of remasters, but this is a ground-up remake with some generous quality-of-life updates included.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159237/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Newly recorded Japanese and English audio tracks are solid, though the Japanese voices edge out their counterparts thanks to some especially endearing performances, particularly Tomoyo Takayanagi as Estelle. On the music side, the option to switch between three different suites is a welcome addition. The arranged option is particularly stunning.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, high-speed mode will be a blessing for returning players and a boon for anyone looking to grind XP without the drag. Difficulty settings cover a wide spectrum, from casual mode to the punishing nightmare, a series staple that makes its return here.</p>
<p>The game releases on both Switch 1 and 2, with a cheap upgrade pack for those that might invest in the new console at a later date. Performance-wise, the original Switch outputs in a noticeable 30fps with an impact to the quality when compared to its big brother. The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159235/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console.</p>
<p>1st Chapter is an exciting start to what may become a successful series of remakes. Its engaging, emergent story and wealth of charming characters deserve to be experienced anew or discovered for the first time. Most of all, it revitalised my love affair with JRPGs, a saturated genre of which this feels like a refreshing new high-water mark.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a comprehensive audio-visual update of a classic series opener, with great characters, a world that you’ll want to explore, and deep combat with a wealth of options. The updated style runs best on Switch 2, with only the odd stumble in docked performance.</p></section>
