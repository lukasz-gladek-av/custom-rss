<p>Three of them, to be precise</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> came out years ago. We've been hearing about this Level-5 RPG under a variety of names since way back in 2018, but now, as the <strong>13th November</strong> kick-off date draws ever closer, the game has finally scored a 'final' trailer. Three of them, in fact.</p>
<p>The above 'Final Trailer 1' (because nothing screams 'final' quite like the promise that there's a number '2' around the corner) dives deep into the game's story, with over six minutes of dramatic dialogue, plot twists, and more enunciations of the word "football" than we ever thought possible. The script leaves us feeling a little worried, it's true, but there's no denying that it's comprehensive.</p>
<p>Then we have 'Final Trailer 2' (which you'll find at the bottom of this article), which has a little more gameplay to show. This one spotlights the game's 'Chronicle' mode, which sees you travel back through series history and recruit new players to your team.</p>
<p>The trailer boasts that there will be 5,400 different characters featured, once the DLC arrives shortly after launch. Yep, <em>five thousand four hundred</em>. We assumed that it was a typo too, but it's written everywhere. Talk about "Everyone is here", eh?</p>
<p>But wait! There's more! Yes, if two 'final' trailers weren't enough, Level-5 also released a third edition titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n8XcE8HZL4">Endless Fun</a>'. This one is only available in Japanese at the time of writing, but we're sure an official translation will follow before long.</p>
<p>Whether you started following this one back in 2018 when it was called 'Inazuma Eleven: Balance of Ares", 2019 when it became 'Heroes' Great Road', 2021 when it shifted to 'Great Road of Heroes', 2022 when 'Victory Road of Heroes' first appeared, or 2023 when it finally settled on 'Victory Road', this one has been a long time coming. Let's just hope it's fun, after all that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="55e2521cde71a"><a title="Nintendo Life x Birthday Cake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55e2521cde71a/nintendo-life-x-birthday-cake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Wow, where to start? It’s official, though. It’s been 20 years since I sat down and cobbled together the somewhat infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2005/11/our_nintendo_life_begins">Our Nintendo Life Begins…</a>' article back in late 2005, a world before iPhones, iPads, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and YouTube wasn’t even a year old yet.</p>
<p>How times have changed. Both generally and specifically, the video game industry.</p>
<p>When I wrote that first article, we were technically still in the <em>GameCube</em> era. I had really enjoyed my brief stint putting together 'GameCube UK', a website all about… (you guessed it) GameCube in 2001-2002. Then, with the Nintendo 'Revolution' on the horizon, I was getting the itch to get back into running a website about games, and Nintendo <em>Life</em> was born.</p>
<p>Back when the site turned 10, I penned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/site_news_nintendo_life_turns_10_today">an article that details the early years of Nintendo Life</a>, if you are interested in that.</p>
<p>The site's name truly <em>is</em> fitting, though, considering that over the years it has become a bigger and bigger part of my life, dominating my entire adult existence. There can’t be many days over the last 20 years that I haven’t interacted with it in some way or at least read/replied to a related email.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough self-indulgence. I’m incredibly proud of Nintendo Life reaching this milestone. It is a testament to all the lovely people who have been on our team, both the amazing staff we have today and all who have come before over the decades. Without them, the website would simply be a shell.</p>
<p>Nintendo Life (mega)evolved from a hobbyist project into a fully fledged business and helped launch the careers of lots of people, most of whom are still working in the games industry today.</p>
<p>We also have to thank Nintendo itself for simply doing what Nintendo does. Given the turbulent times they have faced over the last two decades, I think this particular anniversary finds them in a pretty good position, all things considered. They’ve clearly evolved during the Switch 1 era, mainly for the better, but like any corporation driven by profits, they still have some negative aspects that concern me, as a fan.</p>

<p>Nintendo UK and Nintendo of America have been very supportive of Nintendo Life over the years, and we continue to appreciate their cooperation and respect.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, we have to thank you. Yes, you, the reader, the viewer, the user, the watcher. If you are reading this, you are part of our journey. Some of you have been around since the beginning, and for some maybe this is your first ever article. Without you, our audience, there would be no Nintendo Life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for visiting.</p>
<p>Everything may have started with Nintendo Life, but in those 20 years, we also started a family. Our company name became <a href="https://hookshot.media/">Hookshot</a> and spawned new sites that you all (hopefully) know and love with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. Although each site has its own dedicated staff, Hookshot itself is one big team, something we are all incredibly proud of.</p>
<p>Only yesterday, the Hookshot team grew once more as we launched the new <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry website</a>, a new partnership between the newly independent Digital Foundry and Hookshot.</p>

<p>It’s hard to know where Nintendo Life will be in another 20 years' time; uncertain times are almost certainly ahead. Right now, the internet is clearly evolving, and so must we.</p>
<p>Support from our audience is required now, more than ever. If you enjoy our work, it’s easy to support us. Visit the website (without an adblocker) or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">become a paid supporter</a> - then, if you can, spread the word to your friends, and finally, tell us how Nintendo Life can serve <em>you</em> better.</p>
<p>Today, though, is for celebration, and whilst 7th November 2025 is the official birthday/anniversary of Nintendo Life turning 20, we will be putting together various mini projects and articles over the next 12 months to fully celebrate the occasion. Watch this space!</p>
<p>Thanks for playing!</p>
