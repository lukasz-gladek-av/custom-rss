<p>Playable on Switch 2, too</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random">Lost In Random</a> was very well-received when it launched back in 2021, with our very own review awarding the hybrid of roguelike, dice-rolling, deckbuilding, boardgame and real-time action (phew!) a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lost-in-random">great 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>So, it may be of interest to you to know that the sequel to all of this very good stuff, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a>, came out yesterday on Switch (and Switch 2, though only via backwards compatibility - how very exciting that we now live in such a thriving ecosystem).</p>
<p>Described as a "fast-paced roguelike set in the world of Lost In Random", this sequel from Stormteller Games — now with Thunderful on publishing duties — serves as the next chapter in the story of a world where children must roll a dice to decide their stations in life. Which seems harsh (although what's the chances they'll end up in a worse spot than "games journalist"?)</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Of course, your main protagonists aren't having any of that, and we expect a further fight back against the establishment will follow as a new tale involving the Queen of Random — yes, the world here is called Random, you see — unfolds before us in the series' unique graphical style. As the press release details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mastery Meets Chance</strong>: Engage in fast-paced, second-to-second combat that blends real-time action with strategic decision-making - and a touch of luck.</p>
<p><strong>Forge Your Playstyle</strong>: Wield four unique weapons, throw your die-companion, and combine 100+ relics with powerful card-based abilities to unleash devastating synergies.</p>
<p><strong>Ever-Changing World</strong>: Traverse four randomly generated worlds, each with its own distinct secrets and challenges and face over 30 different enemy types and formidable bosses.</p>
<p><strong>A Dark Fantasy Tale</strong>: Immerse yourself in a fully voiced story set in a Tim Burton-inspired world, brought to life with hauntingly beautiful landscapes and an enchanting soundtrack."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Judging by the game's trailer, there's more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> in the mix here, which is a very good thing indeed, and feedback over on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/">very positive</a> thus far, so this is defo one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die released yestoday (17th June) with a 10% launch discount putting it at <strong>$22.49/£17.99.</strong> The Fortune Edition, which includes a special digital artbook, exclusive soundtrack and cosmetic DLC is available for <strong>$28.99/£23.19.</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5s-stellar-blade-is-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), developer Shift Up has secured a dev kit for the Switch 2 and has begun intial work for a supposed port of the game. The team has also gifted a whole bunch of Switch 2 units to its employees.</p>
<p>Shift Up itself has told PlayForum that "nothing is confirmed" regarding a potential Switch 2 release, but that it is "reviewing various possibilities internally".</p><p><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6evwsrgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The biggest question mark with all of this is whether Sony Interactive Entertainment would handle publishing duties for the Switch 2. The company is no stranger to releasing games on Nintendo hardware, having notably launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> simultaneously with its PS5 release in 2024.</p>
<p>A hypthetical launch on the Switch 2 isn't entirely out of the question, however, since Stellar Blade recently made its way to the Steam Deck to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawWWDl7FZM">positive critical reception</a>, despite its inability to maintain that 60fps sweet spot.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's vastly improved specs over its predecessor has meant that games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> run remarkably well. The former has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2">praised by Digital Foundry</a>, with positive comparisons made to the game on Xbox Series S in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes and ears open for a potential Stellar Blade launch on the Switch 2 in the coming months, and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>It wasn't-a me</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas. The theft was discovered while the driver was at a Love's truck stop in Bennett, Colorado on 8th June during a routine inspection.</p>
<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>
<p>One GameStop store recently come under fire for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">stapling receipts to Switch 2 console boxes</a>, penetrating the packaging and damaging the console's screen inside. The company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">attempted to make light of the situation</a> with an amusing social media post, but again drew criticism for having allegedly used a photo that rightly belongs to the outlet Bloomberg.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Sunshine" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f804adf8a94a5/super-mario-sunshine.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> is often regarded as a bit of an oddball entry in Nintendo's flagship platforming series. It has its fair share of jank, sure, but it's also considered to be a cult classic with fans thanks to its unique gameplay mechanics and memorable setting.</p>
<p>If you happened to be clued in to the game's initial release back in 2002, then you might recall the time when Nintendo pulled off one of the most ridiculous marketing stunts we've ever seen, and it involves pasta – <em>lots</em> of pasta.</p>
<p>Y'see, Nintendo served up a total of 3,265 pounds of so-called 'Pasta a la Mario' at San Francisco's Little Italy, effectively breaking the Guinness World Record for the largest bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>Attendees who arrived dressed as Mario or Luigi were invited to jump into the bowl of pasta and recover hidden Nintendo-themed prizes, including a rather lucrative trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Footage of the event has resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jusdberube.bsky.social">Justin D. Berube</a> over on Bluesky, who has had short videos of the stunt saved for decades.</p>


<p>Gross, right? Pretty funny, though.</p>
<p>If you're itching to replay Super Mario Sunshine and happened to miss out on the limited 2020 compilation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch, you'll be pleased to know that the game is scheduled to launch on the GameCube NSO app for the Switch 2 at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 via the Expansion Pack subscription tier, with three games playable at launch. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>.</p>
