<p>Experience a brand-new tale in Dark Ties</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega isn't slowing down any time soon when it comes to the Yakuza series, and with this in mind, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has today announced it's bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a></strong> to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next year.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://youtu.be/7VZM3ysP4vg">RGG Summit 2025</a>, the talented studio confirmed this particular entry would be arriving on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>, with <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">digital pre-orders going live today</a> and physical version pre-orders to follow in the "coming days".</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official game description, the third entry originally made its debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and it's now been "reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology". It also comes with the brand-new tale, Dark Ties. Here are some more details about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally debuting on PlayStation 3 in 2009, <strong>Yakuza 3</strong> has been reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology. This evolved edition brings Okinawa to life, featuring more intense battles, added cutscenes that bring depth to the story, and minigames chock-full of replay value. Kiryu's back in the brawl, continuing the fight to protect those he holds dear.</p>
<p>This title also includes <strong>Dark Ties</strong>, which stars Yoshitaka Mine, Kiryu's adversary. Follow Mine on his journey from working as a venture company's founder to becoming a full-fledged yakuza member. After losing everything, Mine sets off in an attempt to form a connection that would fill the void in his heart. Kazuma Kiryu and Yoshitaka Mine live in different ways.</p>
<p>Walk alongside them as their paths intersect, throwing both of their fates in the balance.</p>
