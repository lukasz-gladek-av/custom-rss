            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>At last, after assuring fan's that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>'s free DLC would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-is-still-coming-this-month-so-dont-worry">out "around Christmas"</a>, Level-5 has delivered the goods right on time.</p>
<p>Version 2.0.0 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/2003806280893567182">available to download now</a> on Switch 1 &amp; 2 and it includes <strong>The Sinister Broker Bazario’s Schemes</strong>, an open-world roguelike DLC expansion that adds a new area to the game, Snoozaland. This is available from Chapter 3 onwards in-game.</p>
<p>The patch goes way beyond just a whole boatload of playable content, though. There are five new mounts, new items, weapons, and customisation options, a higher damage cap, an increase in the number of houses you can build at your home base, and the ability to polish tools made by a Blacksmith, Carpenter, and Alchemist.</p>
<p>If you want all of the granulars, then here are the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_2_0_0/">full patch notes from Level-5</a>:</p>
