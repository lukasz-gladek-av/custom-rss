<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a fresh new survival horror from Bloober Team, has a new deep dive trailer, giving players a proper look at the story and characters from the upcoming Switch 2 title.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty sweet, and we're particularly intrigued by a character called The Warden, who looks like a cross between Cronos' protagonist and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>' Slayer. Bloober Team states that we'll be meeting "a lot of characters" in the game, and it sounds like the devs have put a lot of focus on telling a human story amongst the blood and gore.</p>
<p>Coming off the back of Silent Hill 2, we're intrigued to see if Bloober Team can continue its winning streak. It's no doubt received some criticism for its storytelling in the past, and Silent Hill was very much the brainchild of Team Silent developers Takayoshi Sato and Hiroyuki Owaku.</p>
<p>Still, we're excited to dive into this one. Up until recently, it was only confirmed for the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but a recent Partner Direct confirmed its existence for the Switch 2, and it'll be launching on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>. So less than a month to go!</p>

Let us know.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

<p>We've been talking about 8BitDo a fair bit recently, as the Chinese peripheral maker has just made its large catalogue of controllers backwards compatible with Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-8bitdo-controllers-require-a-firmware-update-to-work-on-switch-2">via a firmware update</a>, and they've also got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fight-fans-rejoice-8bitdo-is-launching-a-new-arcade-controller-for-the-switch">snazzy arcade controller</a> for Switch, too.</p>
<p>This review, though, I'm taking a look at the brand new 8BitDo Pro 3 Controller which is a very, very nice-looking piece of kit. Especially if you get the Gamecube-styled purple one. I got a grey one, which I'm not cross at anyone about. It's all good.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xgqhtl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Controllers, it feels to me at least, have become even more of a hot topic than usual these days, and a lot of this interest is to do with the leaps and/or bounds being made in joystick and trigger technology. Issues like <em>*whisper it*</em> stick drift and unresponsive or janky triggers are being dealt with by utilising technology like Hall Effect or the newer TMR variety of magnetic wizardry to solve age-old problems.</p>
<p>8BitDo's Pro 3 Controller is compatible with Switch 1 and 2 (as well as PC, Apple, Steam, and Android devices), packs TMR joysticks, which are apparently even more sensitive than Hall Effect. Everyone wants TMR — that's 'Tunnelling Magnetoresistance' — sticks this year, where last year it was Hall Effect or die, it seemed. Anyway, TMR they are and they feel brilliant.</p>
<p>There's a high-quality feel to this controller all around, in fact, that I'm gonna say sits just fractionally below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's Pro Controller 2</a>. Now, considering that the Pro 2 may well be the most premium-feeling controller I've held (and I own some nice ones), this is a great turnout for a third-party product, and even with swappable magnetic buttons — sometimes these things just make the overall product feel jankier — it all comes off as properly expensive and nice to hold. It's weighty, the rumble feels great, and those joysticks...this magnetic magic, or voodoo, or whatever it is the stick boffins are putting in here, it is damn smooth and responsive.</p>

<p>In terms of the triggers, they can be switched between two modes, giving you Hall Effect and micro-switch options. What does this mean? Well, it means you've got a little switch beside your triggers on both sides to move between the regular Hall Effect trigger action (that's just normal trigger movement to you and me, mate), and a micro-switch mode that means the triggers don't move, they just click when you push them. Simples!</p>
<p>They feel fantastic, and I love the extra length they've been given, as it adds a little more to the grip and makes differentiating between the two sets of shoulder buttons easy-peasy. Oh, and speaking of grip, the entire back of this controller is a slightly darker shade of grey, indicating a nice gripped surface that keeps the thing in your hand, even when you're getting sweaty on the last few moments of a round of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> - the game I've used mostly to test this one out.</p>
<p>Right beside the bumper buttons along the top of the Pro 3, you've also got two smaller 'L4' and 'R4' programmable buttons, too, and these combine with the 'PR' and 'PL' paddles on the back to give you lots of options on programming in-game button placements.</p>
<p>In terms of the D-pad, it's a retro-feeling, bulky sort of number which is raised up quite nicely, so it's one of the better ones I've used recently in the patented D-pad test I've devised (sticking on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ultra_street_fighter_ii_the_final_challengers">Street Fighter 2</a> to see how many hadouken fails I get. Yes, that's right, I'm a scientist now).</p>
<p>The ol' D-pad, of course, is a very personal taste, mileage-varying sort of thing, but for my fighting game needs, this is doing the business. Oh, and it's nice and clicky through all its points, which I love. If you hate weak, mushy-feeling D-pads, this one is the opposite. It stands out from the face of the controller and feels properly solid.</p>
<p>To connect the Pro 3 to your Switch or Switch 2, you've got a couple of options, with a USB-C dongle for the 2.4ghz connection, alongside Bluetooth and good old wired mode. Everything here was easy to set up and get running, and I've had no issues in using the controller using any of these connection methods. Now, though, is a reasonable time to point out one of only two real complaints I have with the 8BitDo Pro 3; it can't wake the Switch 2 up from sleeping. Oh dear.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> an issue with third-party stuff for Switch 2 at the moment (although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-wake-up-support-cant-make-up-for-the-downgrades">some manufacturers seem to be getting around the issue now</a>), and it's just a bit of a shame we don't have that luxury here. If this thing could wake the Switch 2 up, as it can do the Switch — which is even more annoying — then I would be struggling to find fault, really, but for now it is an issue that irritates me, and I hope they update the controller so it can wake both consoles.</p>

<p>On to the changeable magnetic face-buttons now (the fun stuff), and I have to say I always shy away from controllers with parts that come off and on, as they sometimes feel a bit naff as a result. However, this is a nice, straightforward magnetic swap-over that takes less than a minute, and the SNES-styled coloured buttons look cracking.</p>
<p>The controller comes with a very nice charging stand that has a discreet light bar running along the bottom, so it looks cool in a dark room. On the bottom of the stand you'll find a little compartment; in here you've got space to store your buttons, and it's here you'll find the magnetic button tool for swapping them out. This is also where you'll find your USB-C dongle, so don't panic — like somebody I know did — if you can't see it when you open the box. I've got the coloured buttons on my Pro 3 at the moment, and I doubt I'll take them off.</p>
<p>Now, besides the magnetic button fun, you also get two lovely ball-top joystick caps, so you can go full retro arcade mode. Big red shiny balls are always an unexpected delight, they feel good on your thumbs, and they look ridiculous. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Some gamers don't like the layout of this particular style of controller with both sticks down on a level at the bottom, but I've always been a fan, so this aspect doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting. As too are all the other bells and whistles you get here, such as six-point motion control, a turbo function, and that charging dock, which, again, feels proper premium in its materials and robustness.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of battery life, I've played from a full charge on this controller for absolutely ages, and it seems 8BitDo's claims of 20 hours of battery life are on the money. This positive, however, shall now transform into my second issue with the Pro 3. Well, it's not me, actually, it's 8BitDo; they've gone and made it so you can't take the battery out. It's welded in there.</p>

<p>This is a shame, obviously, as if the battery dies, well, it's wired-only time, and for some it'll just be a total dealbreaker. I'm of the opinion that, whilst not ideal, I'm willing to take the trade-off for a longer-lasting battery, and it definitely adds to how solid and nice the controller feels overall, having it so permanently put together. However, I get the annoyance.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the 8BitDo controller is a bit of a belter. It can't wake up the console, and you can't remove the battery. Those are my only issues, and they're big ones, no doubt. But I'm happy enough with the style and vibe of this controller, the finish and feel — especially given we get TMR and Hall Effect and all the things that push some controllers up into crazy price ranges — for $69.99/£59.99. It may not be bargain basement territory, but the tech here is stuff I have paid way more for quite recently on PC.</p>
<p>It's also tech that works and is worth shouting about. TMR sticks are super smooth and responsive, the triggers feel bloody great, and it gives your Switch 2 games a real boost if you're making the jump from Joy-Con. I will also say that while I prefer the overall feel of Nintendo's Pro Controller 2 in my hands, 8BitDo's offering here wins with regards to its sticks, triggers, D-pad <em>and</em> selection of programmable buttons.</p>

<p>So, whilst Nintendo's premium offering can wake the console, for me it's being beaten when you're actually in-game. Not a bad showing then, and as someone who owns a fair few 8BitDo controllers, such as the lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/hardware_8bitdo_sn30_proplus_review_-_the_best_third-party_switch_controller_just_got_better">SN30 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/hardware_review_8bitdo_m30_-_the_best_retro_controller_on_switch">M30</a> varieties for Switch, this is my favourite so far from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Now, I'm gonna get my big red thumbsticks on here and go play something really sad. For that sweet juxtaposition.</p>

<p>"I wanted him to feel deeply moved after completing the game"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Metroid NES box" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94916cc00d993/metroid-nes-box.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>'s <a href="https://youtu.be/gFUGG6SFiQQ?si=TLUr5Q5RkF2kVSL_">ending theme</a> is one of the most iconic pieces of video game music from the NES era. The shift from serious and determined to celebratory is masterful for the area; of course, what else would you expect from Hirokazu Tanaka?</p>
<p>Well, the legendary composer — also known as 'Hip' or 'Chip' Tanaka — has shared his motivation for composing that track on <a href="https://x.com/tanac2e/status/1953024137364160999">social media</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-composer-reveals-metroids-ending-theme-was-made-to-impress-one-debugger-on-the-team-i-composed-the-theme-specifically-for-him/">Automaton Media</a>). And it was all to impress one debugger on the Famicom and NES game.</p>
<p>This debugger was playing through the game during the final stages of the debugging process, and many other employees at Nintendo had gathered to cheer him on. Tanaka, however, went one step further and composed the ending theme <em>specifically</em> for this moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The final debugging stage of Metroid’s development was quite memorable for me. We had one staff member that was older than us, and wasn’t an active member of the production team.... I composed the ending theme specifically because I wanted him to feel deeply moved after completing the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a touching little reason to make a song, particularly for someone who was less familiar with the game and was there simply to catch bugs and issues.</p>
<p>And Tanaka sets the scene perfectly, describing the events of the endgame: "I think people who have played the game understand, but even if you manage to rush through defeating Mother Brain, the escape sequence is surprisingly tough, lol" he continues, echoing a sentiment I think we all understood as first-time Metroid players.</p>

<p>But it went beyond just composing the song for the moment, it was all about the entire atmosphere: "For the sake of one debugger, we kept switching to a bigger monitor and making the sounds louder and louder, creating such an amazing atmosphere. All of the staff was having so much fun debugging." And it sounds like it!</p>
<p>The original Metroid released on the Famicom Disk System on 6th August 1986, making the game 39-years-old — how on <em>earth</em> are we about to celebrate Metroid's 40th anniversary next year? Renowned for its tight controls and immersive map, and celebrated as one of the earliest examples of having a female protagonist, it kickstarted one of Nintendo's most-beloved franchises.</p>
<p>'Hip' Tanaka was recently at BitSummit 2025 in Japan and, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tetris-and-metroid-composer-hip-tanaka-is-getting-back-into-video-game-music">when speaking to outlet VGC, mentioned that he wants to compose a video game soundtrack again</a>. We'd welcome it.</p>

<p>Of course you did - you're an intelligent human being. And over the course of the Switch generation, with all the company's eggs now in a single console basket, Nintendo has diversified its business, leaning into non-gaming areas and getting its IP under the noses of a broader audience with mobile apps, movies, theme parks, stores, and all that game. This has been a stated goal for many years, and the monster success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> worked as planned, funnelling interest back to its gaming hardware and software, resulting in revenue bumps across the board.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xgqhtl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, despite its colourful character roster appealing to kids across the age spectrum, the hand-eye coordination needed to operate a 'proper' video game is beyond the abilities of Nintendo's youngest fans. Until we evolve as a species, that's unlikely to change, so it's that demographic — the one-, two-, three-year-olds — that Nintendo is aiming at with this suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">'My Mario' products</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app, which is coming to Switch as well as smart devices, looks to be a simple touchscreen toy where you can interact with Mario by bopping him on the nose, tweaking his moustache, and generally poking and prodding at the poor plumber like many of us did on the start screen of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> back in 1996. It's extremely simple stuff on the face of it, but it's designed to surprise, delight, and snare 'em young with that patented Nintendo charm.</p>
<p>Then there's the wood block set - or set<strong>s</strong>, rather. This is baby toy 101, giving the smallest kids the chance to play around with Nintendo characters without jabbing themselves in the eye with the pointy limb of an amiibo or gnawing on and potentially swallowing a Master Sword.</p>
<p>Looking at the high-res PR pics of these blocks, they appear to have the quality you'd expect from Nintendo. The paint and glaze over the blocks let the woodgrain show through, and they would look right at home next to any number of artisanal wooden block sets on the shelves at your local free-range toddler toy boutique - with prices to match.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the basic three-piece set offering Mario, a Question Block, and a Super Mushroom - that'll only set you back 2,980 yen (around $20 / £15). The characters are also amiibo, remember, so I can see this appealing to people who don't even have kids as a cute little display set.</p>
<p>The full 30-piece set, though — which also includes Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi, plus a wider selection of other items and blocks in a nice little case — comes in at a whopping 19,980 yen (around $135 / <em>£</em>100). There's no word yet on the RRP Nintendo will set for these when they come to the West at a later date, but I can hear the <em>"135 bucks for a bunch of wood?!?!"</em> comments already.</p>
<p>As somebody who has spent more time and money in ludicrously expensive boutique kids' toy shops than he'd like over the past few years, I can confirm that 100 quid for a bunch of glossy wooden blocks <em>isn't</em> unheard of. The NFC tag in the amiibo characters adds negligible production cost in itself, but given the need to embed them in the character blocks and the quality of the paint job and materials...yes, unfortunately, I don't see them coming in much cheaper when they arrive on our shores, either.</p>

<p>Thankfully, my own kids are a year or two past the point where these would appeal — we're in the steering-assisted-Mario-Kart, giggling-and-shouting-"Ooh, ba-nana!" phase right now — but newer Nintendo (grand)parents may find these irresistible. You know, for the kids. And I feel sorry for amiibo fiends who simply have to have every last one. <em>*glances furtively at the Billy bookcase*</em></p>
<p>Ahem. Then there's the Mario book, with pop-out bits and pieces. Yes, seeing all the promo images of smiling parents indoctrinating their defenceless youngsters into the cult of Nintendo gives off disquieting vibes, even for the biggest Nintendo fans. The Pokémon Company has certainly gone further in this direction, with kawaii plushies and products more specifically designed for the youngest of people, but Nintendo's never <em>quite</em> gone here before, never quite stepped into the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse like this, with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/movie/index.html">a stop-motion animated short series</a> and little romper suits and rattles aimed at tiny humans whose facility with a Joy-Con amounts to chewing on it. The Rosalina &amp; Luma Observatory Cot Mobile can't be far off.</p>
<p>Again, everything presented looks like a quality product, and it makes you wonder why it's taken Nintendo so long to go full Disney like this, targeting the audience fresh from the womb in a way that not even self-driving, self-steering, auto-item-deploying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> can manage. For the past decade or more, the Play-It-Loud generation has been phasing into parenthood, so I guess you can chalk this up to Nintendo's slow-and-steady approach. But, slow starters as they are, they're ready now - and they've got their marketing lasers trained on your toddlers.</p>
<p>And your wallets. But there's nothing new about that.</p>
