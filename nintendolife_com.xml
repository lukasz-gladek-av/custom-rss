<p>Get ready to "power-up" in Expeditions</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> has gone down quite well with LEGO and Fortnite fans, and Epic Games continues to enhance the experience with all sorts of new updates.</p>
<p>The latest reveal is a new teaser for <strong>LEGO Expeditions</strong>. Epic has released a trailer describing how players will suit up, squad up and power up next week on <strong>18th June</strong>, but beyond this, nothing else has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Fans are convinced it's going to lead into an "expanded universe" or even a "multiverse" style offering. It will follow on from modes like <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-odyssey?lang=en-US">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-brick-life">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>. When we find out more about this new mode, we'll let you know.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite originally made its debut on the Switch in 2023 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, and is Epic's way of expanding the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> universe. Epic also recently released a free Switch 2 version of Fortnite, and you can find out how LEGO Fortnite and the existing game modes run on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review</a>.</p>

<p>The famous Nintendo tune returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/281807c674aa4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo mentioned how there were all sorts of surprises to discover in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and a week after the game's launch it looks like Totaka's Song has been discovered.</p>
<p>As highlighted on social media and elsewhere online (via Nintendo Everything), you can hear Yoshi humming this Nintendo tune in the game's character menu. Here's a story and video shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/">Mario Kart subreddit by the user 'charizardtelephone'</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was idling on the character select screen when I noticed Mario began humming after enough time passed. I thought, “Huh, they could totally hide hidden tunes like that.” Wait. Hidden music? In a Nintendo game? With Yoshi? It was too good to be true. But after a few seconds, lo and behold, yoshi begins humming Totaka’s song like the idle yoshis do in Mario Kart 8. Very cool Easter Egg. Not sure if anyone else has noticed it yet."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When we tried this out ourselves, Yoshi started humming the same song just seconds later. It might also be a bit harder to hear depending on the music playing in the background.</p>
<p>This famous song by the Japanese Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka is often slipped into many of company's games. And if you're wondering why it's specifically Yoshi that hums this tune, it's because Totaka also happens to be Yoshi's voice actor, and once again voices the character in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This Easter Egg has also popped up previously in Mario Kart 8 along with series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Zelda</a>, and was inserted into titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> back in the day.</p>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART POLL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3effd655ac2fb/mario-kart-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have been wanting to ask a bunch of people this question for a while now, and it seems this is as good a time as any!</p>
<p>It's a question of gaming habits really, and how you approach doing things within them, that I'm sure holds up a mirror (mode) to our personalities in the 'real world' and all that, but I'm not a certified mind...person...so let's skip getting into anything deep.</p>
<p>No, best not. Anyway. I'm the sort of gamer who needs to stay organised, I'm also the kind of person who checks that doors are locked 50 times every night before bed. It therefore stands to reason that, when playing the likes of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> game, let's say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, since that's popular at the moment for some reason, I 100% <em>must</em> complete a cup to its fullest and shiniest gold-star level before racing the next one.</p>
<p>It is — or at least it feels as though it is — against any religion to skip forward though cups without first making sure I fully rinse the one I'm currently on. I just don't do it. Well, unless something is really frustrating me, then I <em>might</em>. Only might, mind.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs with most games I play. I can't leave a nook or cranny unexplored in open-world games (something that often puts me off them entirely) and I always feel the need to spend extra time milling about and trying to find everything before moving on - hence why Ubisoft-esque maps full of icons have the effect of making me need a 'wee lie down'.</p>
<p>So, I want to know, via the medium of a good old-fashioned poll, how many of you lot need to make sure you've done <em>everything</em> before moving on in Mario Kart's cups, and who is reckless? Who lives their lives like gaming anarchists, blasting through everything without a care in the world? You know. Having <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Let's get polling!</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd9984a9e6f89/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Nintendo itself put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">an official Switch 2 Camera</a> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the new console</a>, it's Hori's officially licensed — and we have to say <em>adorable</em> — Piranha Plant camera which attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>A little USB-C webcam fashioned after the enemies from the Super Mario series, it's certainly a lot more fun-looking that Nintendo's old-school radio mic-looking one. However, the cuteness comes with caveats when it comes to image quality.</p>
<p>Let's fetch our gardening gloves and take a look, shall we?</p>
<h2>What's in the box?</h2>

<p>In the box you get the camera itself (with clip-on leaves to attach to the stem), the base 'pot' which the camera connects to via USB-C, a 1.5m USB-C cable, and a little right-angled headphone jack adaptor (to use, presumably, if you're plugging in wired headphones but the leaves are in the way).</p>
<p>You also get a large leaflet full of warnings in various languages with a QR code pointing to <a href="https://hori.co.uk/content/PRODUCT%20MANUALS/NSX-001E_EN_Online_Manual.pdf">an instruction manual</a> containing the same warnings alongside the necessary how-to-use info.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the resolution is 640 × 480 pixels, so instantly you shouldn't be expecting iPhone-level quality here. Capture is 30 frames-per-second and it has a viewing angle of 85°. To compare, Nintendo's offering offers 1080p with a viewing angle of around 110°.</p>

<p>As with Nintendo's standard camera, the Piranha Plant is surprisingly petite — even smaller than Nintendo's. The plant detaches from the pot, too, immediately making it an attractive option if you play in handheld mode a lot and plan on engaging in regular GameChat sessions with friends and family.</p>
<h2>First impressions</h2>
<p>I've never been a <em>massive</em> fan of Piranha Plants, with the notable exception of the amiibo, which ranks in my top three, probably. There's something about the detailing on the head, with the glistening tongue and the teeth, that I just find ace. And this camera has a similar effect! It's incredibly cute.</p>
<p>There's a specific place at the bottom of the stem for the leaves to clip on (I had them in the wrong place for a while). The plant's big lips close around the camera itself, which covers the lens for privacy - a neat touch compared to Nintendo's twisty shutter and 'on' light. The bendy stem/cable even lets you pose the plant, adding to the personality, and while it's not useful for anything in particular (other than taking pics of your camera - oh the irony), you're able to open its mouth halfway, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>The camera itself plugs into the top of the Switch simple enough. It's just light enough (30g) for the port to grip it solidly enough, though I wouldn't go shaking it too hard. But that goes for your shiny new Switch 2, as well.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c65e89c6c8f24/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot capture is disabled when the camera's on, so getting shots is a challenge. On the plus side, the 480p resolution makes my scraggly beard look fuller - whack that in the 'Pros'... — <em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>I tested handheld mode first. Once the camera is plugged into the top and you're in a GameChat group, simply share your camera in the settings and you're off (or you can 'Test USB-C Camera' in the system settings beforehand).</p>
<p>You can manually zoom in and choose whether you want your background visible, although anybody who's fiddled around during a Zoom call or Google Meet knows the patchiness caused by suboptimal lighting and other environmental factors on these filters. You can also choose to have just your face framed in a circle.</p>
<p>As the modest specs should make obvious, it's immediately apparent that the video quality here will be surpassed by practically any other camera-quipped device in your house. This device is <em>extremely</em> limited in terms of video capture ability.</p>
<p>However, for what it's designed to do — ie. work in conjunction with GameChat to inject your hilarious face into Nintendo games so that your pals can see (as well as hear) your moans, groans, and celebratory yelps while dealing and receiving green-shell punishment — it functions just fine.</p>

<p>As well as being a camera stand, the green plant pot doubles as a clip to attach to your TV — handy if you park your dock behind the telly. Clipping it to my thin-screened LG OLED, it felt a little precarious, but provided you bend the plant stem to balance everything, it stays put well enough. Don't go shaking your TV...but again, why would you <em>want</em> to violently shake your expensive electronics? Why do you keep doing that? <em>Just leave them be!</em></p>
<p>Ahem. As with everything else with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the Switch 2 hardware</a>, the camera just works. The face-tracking follows you around the room well enough, although it definitely gets a little, erm, let's say 'impressionist' if you're feeling generous ('AI-style, feature-melting nightmare fuel' if not) when you move backwards out of its face-sensing range. Around three metres back it started getting choppy for me, and the camera failed to pick my face up after I moved three-and-a-half/four metres away in a decently-lit living room during the morning. It's not a high-tech gadget.</p>
<p>BUT! I'd argue that getting upset about the image quality here is missing the point somewhat. When you look at Nintendo's own offering, it's a sturdy little thing but it's only delivering 1080p and, crucially, if you're sitting across the room, the resolution of your face once it's been cropped out by the software will be an order of magnitude below HD.</p>
<p>Also, any video conferencing tool that automatically removes the background is patchy. With the official Nintendo one, there's all sorts of artefacting and flickering going on as the console struggles to filter out the non-human elements in suboptimal living room lighting conditions. The lower resolution of Hori's cam doesn't help, but it's not a massive step down from the alternative, either.</p>

<p>Simply put, whether you go with Nintendo or Hori, you aren't getting premium-level, full-resolution, Face Time-quality video with either option. However, it works well enough to get the job done (which at launch is essentially injecting a live profile pic into a box in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">we all had a great time GameChatting with that</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the more pixels, the better, but the Piranha Plant camera will be sufficient for the vast majority of face-tracking use cases. It looks like the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree TV</a> might demand more with its CameraPlay, and the resulting images will look commensurately worse with this 480p cam. But even with its lowest-of-low-tech qualities, this camera just makes me smile every time I see it. It's a fun little thing.</p>
<p>Compared to Nintendo's camera, it's a straight-up trade: resolution for cuteness. If you happen to have a compatible USB-C camera already, it's hard to recommend either, especially if you don't plan on making GameChat a regular thing. But given that this is cheaper than Nintendo's camera (outside the US at least - this is £33.99 / €39,99 / $59.99), and that the other one, while offering better resolution, is hardly a precision eyepiece, it's all much of a muchness to me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering, it absolutely works just as a standard PC webcam. So if your laptop camera's borked and you want to give your video calls that blurry, late-'90s vibe, a Piranha Plant on your desk is an option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're buying Piranha Plant Camera — or any of the Switch 2 cameras — expecting a crystal-clear, super-sharp image, you're going to be disappointed. These are rough-and-ready webcams meant to deliver knockabout, lo-fi fun in the vein of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/game_boy_camera">Game Boy Camera</a> or the 3DS' in-built lens. Approached from that angle, Hori delivers the functionality you want in an exceptionally cute package.</p>
<p>If you're planning on streaming or you absolutely need the best possible picture quality, this simply won't meet your needs. Otherwise, only grade-A grouches won't grin when they walk into the living room and see this clipped to the top of the telly.</p>
