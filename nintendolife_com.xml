<p>Users have noticed the system's back panel "slightly bulging"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Some would argue the real tests can only begin when a product is in the hands of consumers and while Nintendo likely ran every scenario it possibly could with the Switch 2 during in-house tests, certain issues are reportedly surfacing now that it's out in the wild.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/a-couple-of-switch-2-owners-are-already-reporting-expanded-back-panels-nintendo-investigates-possible-causes/">reported by Automaton</a>, some Switch 2 owners have noticed "slightly bulging" back panels on their new units. One individual on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l4oilq/switch_2_swollen_battery_check_the_backs_of_your/">Nintendo Switch subreddit known as 'tombyt3'</a> explains their own experience and how Nintendo is already investigating the case. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it's believed to be linked to a possible "swollen battery" in the unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just got my brand new Switch 2 delivered today and noticed the back panel was slightly bulging. Contacted Nintendo and they've confirmed it looks like swollen battery and have raised an investigative case into it.</p>
<p>I appreciate it's hard to see in the photo, but in person it's easily visible and running your hand over the back makes it even more obvious.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share in case anyone else is experiencing similar issues or has a buldge on the back and not sure if to return it or not - I've been advised by them to turn it off, put it back in the box and return to them ASAP as it could be a fire risk if left unnoticed.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is just a one off, but check yours if you haven't!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned by the source, "swelling" of rechargeable batteries in these types of devices has happened before. It should be pretty easy to detect on your unit, as you'll be able to see a slight bulge on the back end of the system. This does not appear to be a widespread issue for the Switch 2, but it won't hurt to check if you're one of the millions of people who have already bought the system.</p>
<p>Our friends at Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/have-you-checked-on-your-wii-u-gamepad-battery-recently">recently reported a similar situation playing out</a> with the batteries in older devices like Wii U GamePads, and it's also occurred in the past with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/psa-check-your-psp-battery-right-now">other devices such as Sony's PSP</a> and can be a "fire risk" as noted above.</p>

Wonder</a> in 2023 and he's a huge fan of Mario.</p>
<p>Kevin Afghani has now returned to the role once again in the new Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/KevinAfghani/status/1934736758157218002">he's taken to social media</a> to mention how it's been a "truly unbelievable experience" as the Mario Kart series was an "absolute pillar" of his childhood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hearing myself in Mario Kart is truly an unbelievable experience. Mario Kart was an absolute pillar of my childhood. I cannot believe how lucky of a person I am to be able to be a part of games that mean so much to me."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He also hopes fans are having an "incredible time" with the new entry in the long-running kart racing series.</p>
<p>Afghani shared a similar comment when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> was released on the Switch last October, but has kept a relatively low profile since taking on the role. Kevin voices multiple other characters in the Mario universe including Luigi, Wario and Waluigi.</p>
<p>In some other Mario Kart news, the voice of Princess Peach has been replaced after an 18 year run.</p>

<p>A recent firmware update made the carts compatible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10d03a3e8abec/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo cracked down on piracy in all sorts of ways during the Switch generation and it's now reportedly taking action on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nintendo-mig-ban-roms-mario-kart-1851784610">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, Nintendo is seemingly banning anyone found using the MIG Switch cartridge on its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This cartridge (which allows users to load "backed up" or "pirated" games) recently received a firmware update – allowing it to load Switch games onto the Switch 2 via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-updates-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list">backwards compatibility</a> feature.</p>
<p>Some photos doing the rounds on Reddit and social media show <strong>Error Code: 2124-4508</strong> which apparently pops up after using this card. It mentions how "the use of online services" have been "restricted by Nintendo".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hkmjou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934637497985769875">"Legal dumps" with this specific card</a> are also claimed to be under fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the MIG Switch [card] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something. Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Nintendo seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2hacks/comments/1lcv0wy/mig_flash_ban/">banning users from "online services"</a>, it does not appear to be taking the "nuclear option" according to the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My Switch 2 was banned but my main Nintendo account is not banned. But I wouldn’t hold my breath. Just waiting at this point for Nintendo to drop the ban hammer on my account."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users in the same threads responded to these accounts – mentioning how a ban shouldn't come as a surprise at this stage if you take your machine "online" with one of these cards.</p>
<p>News about this particular flash card <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-says-hes-not-involved-with-new-switch-flash-cart">surfaced in January of last year</a>. You can find out more in our previous coverage.</p>
