<p>Is Capcom up to something?</p>

<figure data-uuid="6c488450c3e97"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c488450c3e97/monster-hunter-wilds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom’s <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series has sold incredibly well on Nintendo hardware over the years and while there have been no official updates about the mainline series returning to Switch hardware anytime soon, something rather interesting has apparently been discovered in a new <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> datamine.</p>
<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>. Capcom hasn’t said anything about bringing this new entry to Nintendo platforms, but it has already shown strong support for Nintendo’s new hybrid system with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7hpvtun&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c7905b15e134e"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7905b15e134e/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you think more games should be about giving cursed skulls to weird strangers, then I'm here to tell you that you're fine, you're normal, you're <em>right</em>, and you should play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>.</p>
<p>You may have already played Bad Viking's first game in the 'Strange' series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, a gothically-tinged tale of running a plant shop, but with more than a touch of Lovecraftian business lurking in the shadows. As someone who's a little bored of the more toothless cosy games on the market, I'm always delighted to find something with sinister undercurrents and supernatural goings-on. Also, ritual murder! Not enough cosy games feature ritual murder.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xhvklr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Strange Antiquities might be more of the same after Horticulture, but it's a great formula. People come in, they tell you their woes, and you use your logical and deductive skills to locate the object on your shelves that will solve their problems.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6842ca14e81eb"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6842ca14e81eb/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clever thing is that your shelves are filled with a ton of objects that could, potentially, fit the vague description in the book, and it takes careful reading and attention to clues to pick the right one. If you're looking for something made of gold, should you pick the necklace, or the totem? If you need something that represents a lunar goddess, should you pick an item made in her image, or in the shape of the moon? For detective game sickos like me (and you, I bet) who love having to decipher cryptic clues like you're trying to ask Rumpelstiltskin for directions, this is basically catnip.</p>
<p>Strange Antiques also has that rare quality of making the player feel masterful, which is hard to achieve, because the player usually has absolutely <em>zero</em> experience doing whatever it is the game's about. I love <strong>Ace Attorney</strong>, but I know diddly squat about the law, and although I technically have grown vegetables in my real-life garden, my harvest has never been as bountiful or marketable as those I grow in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've never been a semi-magical purveyor of arcane goods who occasionally explores graveyards and ruins to find more (although if you see a job posting for that, please send it to me), but Strange Antiquities – with all its reference tomes and maps – makes me feel incredibly competent at the task. A customer comes in, says something unhelpfully ambiguous about their ailment, and waits patiently as I comb through my books, cross-reference them with items, and finally settle on an object to give them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="43c04ae1d9981"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43c04ae1d9981/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're not giving out curios and knicknacks, you're exploring, through Strange Antiquities' concise and clever daily riddles. Some of these riddles are presented as text – "An escaped prisoner ran north-west. He hid me in the first building he came to" – which require you to find a location on a map that corresponds to its clues. In that example, you have to find a prison, trace a line northwest, and find the first building on that line. That one's easy, because it's the first one, but it still has that fulfilling sense of reading between the lines that all good detective games cultivate.</p>
<p>Other riddles are more opaque, providing you with nothing but a shape, and hoping that you'll have studied your maps enough to recognise that it's the outline of a house, or a tombstone, or a room. These puzzles need you to notice subtle details, read between the lines, and cultivate an internal spatial understanding of each area, in order to solve the riddle. Asking players to engage with the world on such an intimate level is genius – it creates a sense of player-directed immersion that adds to that feeling of mastery and ownership.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that, in a year dominated by detective-y puzzle-y games, most of which are not on the Switch (boo), I feel like Strange Antiquities has flown a little under the radar. The much-lauded clique of <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong>The Roottrees are Dead</strong>, <strong>The Drifter</strong>, <strong>The Seance of Blake Manor</strong>, <strong>Type Help</strong>, and the various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rise_of_the_golden_idol">Golden Idol</a> add-ons deserve their praise, but Strange Antiquities deserves to be up there on the puzzle podium with them. It's tough when the competition is so stiff!</p>
<p>So, if you're reading this and you enjoy clues and riddles and all that business, give Strange Antiquities a go (plus Strange Horticulture, if you haven't already played it). And then add it to your Game of The Year list, because it's certainly earned a place on mine. And it's not just because a strange shopkeeper gave me a <em>Purified Amulet Of GOTY</em>. I don't think, anyway.</p>
