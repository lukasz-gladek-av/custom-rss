<p>Before anyone suggests it's a photoshop, the fine folks at VGC have actually seen it with their very own eyes. The same outlet notes how there is a similar "out now" ad for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> alongside it, but the Metroid banner appears to be jumping the gun here.</p>

<p>One theory is this could simply be a template and someone forgot to remove the "out now part" on the Metroid ad. The entire tunnel is also covered in other banners featuring the Switch 2's game library, which further suggests this is <em>probably</em> a slip up.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Nintendo did shadow drop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> on the Switch in 2023, but given the build up to the fourth major outing and the recent Switch 2 confirmation, this type of release seems far less likely in this case. And hey, we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a> to look forward to next month.</p>
<p>For now, Metroid Prime 4 is currently locked in for a <strong>2025</strong> launch. The Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as additional features like Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, we have asked Nintendo to remove the game from the Switch 2 eShop. Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues!"</p>

<figure><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bbf56f765b4d/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday rolled out a new update for the Switch 2 which also included some backwards compatibility fixes for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these happens to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and an issue with the Mii Fighter. Thankfully, in the latest system firmware update, the problem has been fixed (<em>thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Polley001" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user 'Polley001'</a> for the heads up</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo has shared the following information on the game's eShop page about this:</p>
<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game progressions may be affected in portions of the game.</p><p><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Updated 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixed:</strong> When playing online, when a Nintendo Switch 2 player and Nintendo Switch player were matched and someone was using Mii Fighter, it was possible for the match to end immediately.</p>
<p>When creating or editing and saving a Mii Fighter, the thumbnail image showing the Mii Fighter may not appear correctly. This may be improved by saving it again. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, online match issues with Mii Fighters should be resolved. Apart from this, Nintendo says it's also resolved a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As documented in its backwards compatibility PDF, "the frame rate goes to 30 frames per second during football matches in Play Globally (the speed does not change).</p>
<p>According to the title's eShop page, this has now been updated:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Sports - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Updated: 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, both of these titles were already flagged on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOor8Tut3SZbnGbzhkc8DvoSvTHxmahk-PbAEP5aDct6q2TKARuOK">backwards compatibility page</a> and were scheduled to be fixed. Nintendo also released game updates for certain other titles yesterday to resolve some backwards compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Along with these first-party game fixes, multiple third-party experiences have been improved thanks to the latest system update. "Previously identified issues have been resolved" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/IceClimbers" rel="nofollow">IceClimbers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/siavm" rel="nofollow">siavm</a>). We tried out an online match of the second fighting collection and it appears to be working on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Some other issues in games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a> have also been resolved thanks to the latest firmware update (thanks for the heads up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Krambo42" rel="nofollow">Krambo42</a>).</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184125,164338 @ 1750404520 -->

<p>Following a recent story about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-demo-kiosks-are-being-spotted-in-us-stores">Switch 2 kiosks popping up in US stores</a>, we've now got a small but exciting update.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct left you wanting to play the game right now, apparently a demo of the game has been added to these same kiosks at locations like Walmart and Target in the US. You can enjoy ten whole minutes of this upcoming release.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn't said if it will be making this demo, or anything similar, available on the Switch 2 eShop, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you don't have access to one of these kiosks, there's not long to go now – with the full release of Donkey Kong Bananza scheduled to land next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. Nintendo is also releasing a new DK and Pauline amiibo on the same date.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf face collage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103f98688c570/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ganondorf-face-collage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You know what would make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> much easier? A herd of Epona. In terms of making it harder? How about multiple Ganondorfs? Well, you can have all that and more thanks to an exploit discovered by the TOTK community. (Thanks <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/feature/what-happens-if-you-send-glitched-items-to-zelda-notes/">GamingReinvented</a>!).</p>
<p>With the new Zelda Notes companion app (compatible only with the Switch 2 Edition), it's possible to share Autobuild creations by uploading them to the app in-game, which then creates a QR code that you can share online. When someone scans that code in and uploads it to the game, voila, they have your Autobuild creation ready to roll.</p>
<p>Those with modded save files have been taking advantage of this feature in hilarious ways, uploading QR codes for "creations" that range from food, bubbles, items locked to shrines, and, uh, Ganondorf. Complete with a health bar and ready to absolutely destroy Link. He'll follow him absolutely everywhere, too, unless you fast travel away.</p>
<p>For something a little more relaxing than being chased by Demon King Ganondorf, there are codes that allow you to summon multiple Epona too — all of this demonstrated over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1ledk4e/totk_autobuild_sharing_is_so_broken/#lightbox">tearsofthekingdom subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>How is this possible, though? It requires modded save data and access to a modded Switch 1 with TOTK, before transferring the save data to Switch 2. But, essentially, in the save data, you can change any part of an Autobuild to any kind of 'actor' or item.</p>
<p>So, as long as you find a QR code that lets you summon the respective item or character you want (we won't share them here, though they're relatively easy to hunt down), then you can go ahead and cause a different kind of chaos in Hyrule.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering; yes, you can summon an army of good boys, too.</p>

<p>Sub-layers of new info</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're all still hyped full of bananergy after yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">Direct</a> and, if you're anything like us, you'll likely have been straight onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/">official Nintendo website</a> to check out further details. Standard practice.</p>
<p>However, as we've found over the past 24 hours or so, jumping onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html?m=stage">Japanese version of the site</a> reveals a Donkey Kong Bananza section that has a bunch more details than we've got so far in the US/UK. Indeed, our man Zion has been breaking down the Direct, whilst also digging into new deets he's uncovered on said Japanese site, and well, there's lots juicy stuff to pick at here.</p>
<p>You can check out Zion's video for yourself up top for a much more detailed round-up of everything, but of particular interest here is that he's been looking at the sub-layers (that is, the levels that make up the world that you dig down through in the game) and attempting to piece them all together using both the Direct trailer and the extra details found tucked away on Nintendo's Japanese site.</p>


<p>By doing so, he's attempted to order the nine levels he believes are included, as they'll appear in the game, even digging into some of the minigames and deducing where they may show up.</p>
<p>The levels Zion's managed to work out thus far <em>seem</em> to appear in the game in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingot Isle</li>
<li>Lagoon Layer</li>
<li>Hilltop Layer</li>
<li>Canyon Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Ice &amp; Lava'</li>
<li>Forest Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Beach'</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's info still missing here, including two missing areas and some names that are placeholders. It certainly gives us a much easier-to-grasp overview of how this one may flow, and an early idea of just how much variety there's gonna be in this one when it drops in just a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Other juicy details that Zion has picked out in this breakdown include some returning tracks from DK games of the past, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that, we'll be honest, we'd never have noticed without him!</p>
<p>It's fascinating — and very exciting — stuff for anyone who's been waiting years for a new DK game. Bananza really is beginning to look like a surprisingly inventive banger, and the full breakdown gives lots of details on each area too, so go check it out!</p>
