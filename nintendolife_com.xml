<p><strong>Update #3 [<time datetime="2025-07-29T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 29th Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a>'s developer Siactro confirmed this latest entry would arrive on <strong>8th August 2025</strong> for <strong>$4.99</strong>. To go with this announcement, we've got another trailer.</p>
<p>It's also noted how the game is releasing on the original Switch but will also be playable and purchasable on the Switch 2.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #2 [<time datetime="2024-12-08T07:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 8th Dec 2024, 7am</time>]:</strong></p><p>Following the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> last month, developer Siactro has now released a brand new gameplay trailer featuring the music track Blackbird Down (Toree Saturn OST) by KB. This game will arrive on Switch and PC in "early 2025".</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #1 [<time datetime="2024-11-24T13:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 24th Nov 2024, 1:35pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> was scheduled to arrive this year on the Switch, developer Siactro has announced the game has now been delayed until early 2025. The quality would have apparently "suffered a lot" had it been released next month. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am sorry, but I have to delay Toree Saturn into early 2025. A december release was possible, but the quality would have suffered a lot. I worked with really incredible people on this and I am not going to treat their work with a low quality release. I am very sorry!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>When we get a release date update, we'll be sure to let you know!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer and PC demo for the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a></strong> have been released, with the developer Siactro also reconfirming the new entry will arrive at some point in <strong>2024</strong>. This latest update mentions a Nintendo Switch release, too.</p>
<p>When this new project was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/toree-saturn-looks-set-to-provide-even-more-adorable-low-poly-platforming-next-year">originally announced in September last year</a>, there was no Nintendo announcement at that point, so there you go!</p>

<p>Here's a brief rundown about what to expect from the latest entry in this speed-based 3D platformer series (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549240/Toree_Saturn/">via Steam</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way."</p>
<p>- Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​</p>
<p>- New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​</p>
<p>- Controlling Toree got way easier!​<br>
No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​<br>
Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​<br>
Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&amp;M)</p>
