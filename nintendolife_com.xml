<p>Open from <strong>Thursday, 12th February to Sunday, 15th February 2026</strong>, accessing the store will once again require a reservation, and more details for this will be shared closer to the time. As for what kind of exclusive products you can expect to find, The Pokémon Company has confirmed that Mega Evolution will play a big role this year thanks to its reintroduction in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</a></p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59miqngj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's a look at the exact opening times for the store this coming February:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Thursday, 12 February: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.<br>
- Friday, 13 February: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m.<br>
- Saturday, 14 February: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m.<br>
- Sunday, 15 February: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that the Pokémon Center also doesn't accept cash as a payment option, so if you somehow still use cash as your primary payment method, then now's the time to break out the debit card.</p>
<p>For now, here's a small look at some of the merch that will be on offer:</p>

<p>We'll be sure to update you as soon as we hear more on securing those all-important reservations.</p>

<p>Another crossover, mmkay?</p>

<figure data-uuid="295bbd23c4890"><a title="South Park / Fortnite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/295bbd23c4890/south-park-fortnite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is pretty much solely known for its ludicrous crossovers these days, and after the success of the recent events centred around <strong>The Simpsons</strong> and <strong>Kill Bill</strong>, the game is gearing up for yet another.</p>
<p>Yes, on <strong>9th January 2025</strong> (this Friday), <strong>South Park</strong> will enter the fray, though no specific details as to what this might entail have been shared at the time of writing.</p>
<p>All we've got for the time being is a small teaser via social media:</p>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Fortnite drop without a few leaks, mind you, and word on the street is that the content will include skins for Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, along with items relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/south_park_the_stick_of_truth">The Stick of Truth</a>. There may also be some South Park-themed environments, which would honestly be awesome.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if the leaks are accurate, but we're intrigued to see exactly how this pans out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jtzvkm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Pre-orders open this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d9f185e3e0605"><a title="Capcom Arcade Stadium LRG Physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f185e3e0605/capcom-arcade-stadium-lrg-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/round-up-limited-run-games-10th-anniversary-special-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">10th anniversary special presentation</a>, Limited Run Games announced that it was teaming up with Capcom on a line of physical releases. One of the titles falling in this physical line-up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">Capcom Arcade Stadium</a>, which had a vague '2026' release date attached. Well, with the new year finally upon us, we've got some more information on what the physical will have in store.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the collection will go live on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/switch-limited-run-300-capcom-arcade-stadium-vol-1">Limited Run website</a> on <strong>9th January 2026</strong> for <strong>$59.99</strong>, but all those who want to get their hands on a copy will have a big decision to make: which cover do you want to see on your shelf?</p>
<p>Limited Run Games is showcasing a whopping <em>five</em> different covers for this physical release. There's one with all of the standard collection key art, but the other four feature new pieces of artwork for individual games featured in the collection: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/captain_commando">Captain Commando</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/final_fight">Final Fight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/strider">Strider</a>.</p>
<p>The actual boxed contents remain the same, obviously, and each cover will sell for the same price, but it's a pretty tough decision. Here's a closer look at each design, so you can see for yourself:</p>


<p>Pre-orders will be sticking around until 8th February at 11:59pm PT / 2:59am ET (9th Feb) / 7:59am GMT (9th Feb), with copies expected to ship between 1st July and 30th September.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Capcom Arcade Stadium when it first launched on the Switch eShop back in 2021, and while the emulation wasn't always up to scratch, we called it "well worth the price, warts and all" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>
