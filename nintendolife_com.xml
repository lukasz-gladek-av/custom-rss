<p>All will be made available on "new platforms"</p>

<p>Atari and Ubisoft <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles">have announced</a> that Atari has acquired the IP rights to five Ubisoft-published games with a view to make them available on new platforms.</p>
<p>The games in question are <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/cold_fear">Cold Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/i_am_alive">I Am Alive</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/child_of_eden">Child of Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_home">Grow Home</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_up">Grow Up</a>. Notably, none of these have ever seen a release on Nintendo consoles, but with Atari's focus on multi-platform titles in recent years, it's reasonable to assume that some (if not all) may gain new life on the Switch and/or Switch 2.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Atari has expressed its desire to "expand and evolve" all five games, though what this might look like is unclear for the time being.</p>
<p>Child of Eden in particular is a good find for Atari, in our eyes. Originally released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, the musical rail-shooter was directed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who has since gone on to achieve remarkable success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_effect_connected">Tetris Effect</a>, and currently serves as the executive producer for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a>, due for release on the PS5 later this year.</p>
<p>The game also included optional motion controls via Microsoft's Kinect and the PlayStation Move, so we reckon this would translate quite easily to the Switch Joy-Con. Though it is playable with standard controls, of course.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we're also quite fond of Grow Home and Grow Up; two adorable platform titles with minimal, low poly visuals. We're definitely excited to see what Atari can do with these games, and indeed all five titles, in the months and years ahead.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Pac-Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2946e1834820f/sonic-racing-crossworlds-pac-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are quickly closing in on 2025' <em>next</em> high-profile arcade racer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and SEGA keeps adding more and more characters to its rapidly expanding roster. Those loaded up on the game's Season Pass and DLC will see the likes of Steve and Alex from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, SpongeBob SquarePants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a>'s Joker all heading to the track, but none of them will be able to utter a word. It's a strange omission, but Takashi Iizuka has been on hand to explain why all the wider characters are keeping quiet.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/iizuka-explains-how-sonic-racing-crossworlds-dlc-guest-characters-were-chosen-and-why-they-dont-have-voices/">Destructoid</a>, the Sonic Team head explained that there's already a lot of interaction between the racers, so asking the wider studios to <em>also</em> add voice lines for each character would have expanded "the scope of the review that we’ll have to ask the external companies," and potentially made things "difficult" in the process.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jwnvyp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>On top of that, Iizuka claimed that the development team was keen to focus their attention on the Sonic characters first and foremost, ensuring that the interactions between them were nailed down before worrying about the wider cast. "They really had to focus, put all the effort into Sonic," he explained, "and they had to give up on the non-Sonic characters".</p>
<p>Now sure, we won't be all that torn up about not hearing dialogue from PAC-MAN and a Minecraft Creeper, but don't you think it'll look a <em>little</em> weird to have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza</a>'s Kasuga Ichiban silent for the whole race? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>SEGA is kicking off a CrossWorlds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-for-switch-announced">Open Network Test</a> on Switch later this week (from 29th August - 1st September), and pre-loads are now live. This'll be your last chance to check the game out before it launches on 25th September, with nine courses and seven different CrossWorlds at your pre-release disposal. Let's hope that our screams of excitement are loud enough to drown out the uncanny silence from select racers.</p>

<p>Will focus on expanding Nintendo movie adaptations into other mediums</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6ef5aeb870d8/nintendo-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250827.html">has announced</a> that it is renaming its subsidiary company 'Warpstar Inc.' to 'Nintendo Stars Inc.' following its consolidation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Warpstar Inc. – founded on 31st July 2001 – had previously been a joint venture between Nintendo and Hal Laboratory to oversee the <strong>Kirby</strong> franchise, expanding it into other mediums such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby:_Right_Back_at_Ya!">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a> anime series back in 2001. It became an official subsidiary of Nintendo on <strong>1st April 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for its function going forward, Nintendo Stars will be responsible for "the ancillary-use business tied to films that feature Nintendo Intellectual Property". In simpler words, then, it'll focus on the expansion of movie adaptations into other ventures, such as events, merchandise, licensing – that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We know, of course, that Nintendo has two upcoming movie projects in the works: the 2026 sequel to T<strong>he Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, and the 2027 live-action adaptation of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. The company recently provided our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">first glimpse at the cast for the Zelda movie</a>, with Bo Baragson playing the role of Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth playing the role of Link.</p>
<p>Nintendo Stars will also continue its work in the expansion of the Kirby franchise into other mediums. The subsidiary has literal decades of experience at this point, so Nintendo is keen to utilise its expertise, aiming to "strengthen the relationship between Nintendo and its customers".</p>
<p>Our opinion? 'Nintendo Stars' doesn't have quite the same ring as 'Warpstar', but hey, we'll take it.</p>

<p>80 is the new 50</p>

<p>Niantic's popular augmented reality mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> will be getting an update in October, raising the level cap from 50 to 80.</p>
<p>This update will drop on <strong>15th October 2025</strong> and will apparently make the levelling journey "more fun and engaging" by adding new rewards, new cosmetics, and more for each levelling milestone. This update will also see players "jump in level based on their total earned XP". Niantic further states how "no player will go down in level".</p>
<p>Apart from this, there's also going to be a special limited-time update with XP bonuses and Timed Research taking place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<hr>
<p>Below is a breakdown of everything trainers can expect (via the official Pokémon GO game site):</p>
<ul>
<li>The level cap will increase from level 50 to level 80. The overall leveling curve from level 1 to 80 will be rebalanced, and players can earn levels more frequently.</li>
<li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed.</li>
<li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80.</li>
<li>Players at level 70 and higher have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players.</li>
<li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokémon, items, and Gifts. This includes new avatar items starting at level 25!</li>
<li>Based on previously earned experience, some players may automatically jump in level on October 15. Those players will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time. Details about which players will jump in level, and by how many levels, will be shared later.</li>
<li>No players will go down in level, but the amount of XP needed to reach the next level may change depending on your current level. Stay tuned for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also earn the following rewards <em>before</em> 15th October 2025. These items will not be available for levelling up after this date. This also applies to the Level 50 Jacket.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon GO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c16bcf699db4/pokemon-go.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's the rundown about the XP Celebration event (including the bonuses). This event runs from now until 14th October 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>2× Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent Throws</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li>
</ul>
<p>Timed Research will also be available to trainers who are Level 5 and above, with the chance to earn over 7 million XP. A level 47 Level-Up Research task is also being adjusted, so instead of requiring trainers to "explore 25km in a week eight times", you'll now only have to do it twice.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows the recent arrival of Eternatus and the introduction of Max Battles.

<p>Have you tried out these features yet?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At the end of July, Nintendo released an update for the Switch Online Super Nintendo app adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a>.</p>
<p>This update included mouse support (for Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers and USB mouse compatibility), as well as the ability to remap buttons. The same update also featured mouse support for the existing releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed this news at the time, Nintendo has now released an official trailer in English highlighting these new features. You can see everything in motion across games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and Mario Paint. Apart from this, this update also apparently improved the SNES app's CRT filter.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/surprise-the-n64-app-is-also-getting-some-enhancements-on-switch-2">updated the N64 app</a> as well with additional features like a rewind ability and a new CRT filter. Additionally, GameCube Classics were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gamecube/chibi-robo">added to the 'Expansion Pack' service</a> on Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> joining the service last week.</p>
