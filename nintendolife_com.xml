The Pokémon Cafe's new menu looks set to bring these sweet treats into the real world, but it also might be teasing that a pair of legendary 'mon will make their return in the DLC.</p>
<p>Yep, we live in a world where Pokémon spoilers can come from anywhere, even doughnuts. But come on, take a look at the above two baked goods — currently appearing under the tentative titles of "Red Doughnut" and "Blue Doughnut" on the Pokémon Café's <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/ja/pikachu_sweets/news/251121_3309.html">Pikachu Sweets website</a> — and tell us that you <em>don't</em> see Gen III legendaries Groudon and Kyogre.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7nltyrw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>These two doughnuts will appear in Tokyo's Pikachu Sweets store from 10th December for 550 yen. The accompanying item description teases, "The doughnuts are inspired by the special doughnuts that appear in the paid add-on content, 'Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension'! They look like some kind of Pokémon...?" — huh, you don't say.</p>
<p>A 'Hoopa's Mischief Ruby Chocolate Frappe' will also join the menu on the same date. Its bright pink colouring, cream, and Cheerio topping makes the whole thing look a <em>little</em> too sweet in this writer's opinion, but there's no knocking its dedication to the DLC bit.</p>

<p>You'll be able to start your journey through Hyperspace Luminose when the Legends: Z-A DLC arrives on 10th December for £24.99 / $29.99. We've seen a handful of new Megas coming to the expansion so far, including Raichu, Baxcalibur, Chimecho and Zeraora. The final DLC news drop will come next week on 2nd December, so brace for even more newbies.</p>

<figure data-uuid="39a6170d6ab5b"><a title="The Duskbloods leak" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39a6170d6ab5b/the-duskbloods-leak.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, being that it's a FromSoftware joint and all that good stuff, is certainly high on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">our list of things we're very excited about</a> arriving on Switch 2 in the near future. However, given that it's a multiplayer-typed deal in the same vein as the studio's divisive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, we understand that there's a little more trepidation surrounding it, or at least that's how it's felt.</p>
<p>Solo FromSoftware efforts get a big thumbs up very quickly, it seems, but words like 'multiplayer' or even 'online' might make you feel it's not a full-fat adventure from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> studio, perhaps. It's understandable. And yet, according to a new leak surrounding the game (as reported by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-duskbloods-is-more-innovative-than-elden-ring-according-to-new-leak/">Vice</a>), The Duskbloods has been cooking longer and having more consideration put into it than any of FromSoft's work thus far.</p>
<p>The leak in question comes from a Chinese journalist who gained credibility after leaking correct <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> info before it launched back in 2022. As translated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lHUBWlGTgY">Ziostorm</a>, they report that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From what I know, <em>The Duskbloods</em> was greenlit even earlier than the marketing period for <em>Sekiro’s</em> release. It is the FromSoftware title that has spent the longest time purely on gameplay prototyping and validation among all of their games so far. Although its PVE and PVP, it reportedly contains many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to claim that the game, which sees Hidetaka Miyazaki on directing duties, lest you forget, could be more influential than the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/sekiro_shadows_die_twice">Sekiro</a> (which launched in 2019) and its great big red mark that it paints on baddies for you. So it seems as though there may well be some big new mechanic at work here that we are yet to find out about as you get down and dirty as one of the game's vampire-flavoured Dusksworn combatants.</p>
<p>You can check out the full quote in Ziostorm's time-stamped video:</p>

<p>As to why it's been so quiet on the news front regarding the game thus far, the same leaker says that all Elden Ring Nightreign DLC will be wrapped up (something which occurs on 7th December) before FromSoftware turn their full attention to revving up their Duskblood engines. Oooh, we're quite excited, actually.</p>
<p>With no confirmed release date beyond "2026", plus not a whole lot of info about the PvPvE online adventure to sink our teeth into <em>and</em> the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">Switch 2 port of Elden Ring delayed into next year</a>, let's hope we're in for a little pre-Xmas info drop. Or even just a tease. Come on, lads, give us something! Check out the reveal trailer below for a reminder.</p>
