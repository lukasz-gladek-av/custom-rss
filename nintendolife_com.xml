<p>Sign of the times</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a brand new overview trailer for the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, and it has given us our first look at a new batch of Mouthful Mode transformations.</p>
<p>We first locked eyes on Spring Mouth way back at the game's Switch 2 reveal, but Gear Mouth and Sign Mouth are completely new! Gear Mouth gives Kirb some sweet rolling abilities, granting him the power to stick to walls and roll across moving platforms with ease. Sign Mouth, meanwhile, turns the pink puffball into a makeshift sledge for top-speed downhill racing. Side note: we're a little bit in love with Sign Mouth.</p>
<p>Outside of these newbies, the trailer provides a bit of clarity on the game's Star-Crossed World expansion, making clear that you'll be able to dive right in after you've finished the first area. It also highlights the new Colosseum mode, Ultimate Cup Z - EX, which looks to provide a more challenging Boss Rush for those after an extra slice of difficulty.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to see the confirmation that the Switch 2's improved graphics and faster frame rates will be put to good use in the main game and not <em>just</em> the expansion — we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, this one arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>28th August</strong> as both a stand-alone purchase and an upgrade pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Well, here's an unexpected bit of news! After launching on PC earlier this year, Strange Scaffold has announced that its turn-based take on TMNT will be flipping onto Switch on <strong>14th August</strong> — wait, that's next week!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> is all about turn-based action. You'll play as Leo, Raph, Donnie, or Mikey, as you flip, punch, and dash your way through a campaign that sees both Shredder and Master Splinter dead and gone, leaving the heroes in a half-shell to find their own way in the world.</p>
<p>It's a different, more strategic approach to the Turtles than we've seen from the IP before, but the developer promises an "innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat", so there should be just enough combo-focused Cowabunga-ing to keep the old and new Shell Heads happy.</p>
<p>All of this is presented in an almost tabletop visual style, which sees the Turtles moving across the grid on stands as if they are cardboard cutouts. In short, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the Switch version will launch with the all-new Remix Mode, which throws in more enemy variety, higher difficulty, and an increased importance on your Turtle's loadout. This mode will unlock for each level once you complete it, so you don't even need to wait until the end of the game to get involved.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a couple of screenshots from the Tactical Takedown Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 action-packed levels, divided into campaigns focusing on individual characters.<br>
- A unique take on the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the minds at Strange Scaffold (Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, I Am Your Beast).<br>
- Innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat, complete with mutating arenas.<br>
- Gorgeous graphic novel-inspired art style, with paint splatter, figurines, and diorama setpieces.<br>
- Customizable movesets to shape each Turtles' playstyle.<br>
- Thumping multi-genre soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake (Unbeatable, I Am Your Beast).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been keeping our fingers crossed to see this one on Switch for a good few months now (heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/we-really-want-to-see-this-turn-based-tmnt-game-come-to-switch">did we manifest it</a>?), so let's hope it's every bit as <em>totally tubular</em> as it seems.</p>
