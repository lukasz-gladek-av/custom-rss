<p>Don't expect first-party games</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bitsummit 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/034614476e800/bitsummit-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitsummit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that it will be attending BitSummit 2025 to showcase select indie games on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This year's event, dubbed <strong>BitSummit the 13th: Summer of Yokai</strong>, will take place at the the Miyako Messe in Kyoto City from <strong>Friday, 19th July to Sunday, 21st July</strong>. Tickets are on sale now for Japanese attendees via the <a href="https://t.pia.jp/en/pia/event/event.do?eventCd=2511585">Ticket Pia website</a>, while international attendees can use a dedicated <a href="https://ticket.pia.jp/piasp/inbound/bitsummit25eng.jsp">English-language page</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has stressed that it will not be showcasing any first-party games at the event, which is completely understandable given the nature of BitSummit. It's also confirmed that the Nintendo booth will be accessible via a lottery system, with the reservation page available at a later date.</p>
<p>Other confirmed publishers attending the event include PlayStation, PocketPair, Lost in Cult, Inti Creates, Spike Chunsoft, Devolver Digital, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo will no doubt be seeking every available opportunity to advertise the Switch 2 now that it's out in the wild. Having launched earlier this month, it's gone on to become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">fastest-selling console of all time in Japan</a>, and the fastest-selling Nintendo platform in both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>.</p>

<p>It's a feature</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="rumble turned off message switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3877cedaa3806/rumble-turned-off-message-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It seems some eager players have been a little mystified as to the reasons behind a message that's been popping up on their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> screens during play as of late.</p>
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lai1kb/rumble_turning_itself_off/">over on Reddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/49752-switch-2-will-automatically-turn-off-rumble-after-prolonged-use">GoNintendo</a>) a handful of gamers have been rocking up to report that an alert related to the console's HD Rumble has been popping onto their lovely big LCD screens, as you can see in the post below this very paragraph. Of course, with it being a new console, folk have quickly become concerned that there's something up with their Joy-Con and/or Pro 2 Controllers.</p>

<p>Fear not, however, if you happen to see this very same message, which is something that could definitely happen (although this particular writer, through a whole bunch of reviews on the system thus far, has yet to see it), so stay frosty!</p>
<p>As it turns out, amongst the many new bells and whistles the Switch 2 brings with it, its snazzy new HD Rumble 2 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">the reason your Joy-Con and Pro 2 Controller feel so great this time around</a> — has the ability to shut itself off should it overheat or become a burden on other functions, such as battery, we are guessing. Indeed, browsing through the comments from the same post, we've got gamers chiming in on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> both triggering this same function.</p>
<p>Could it become annoying, though? Or can we switch it off more to the point? (No, no we can't as there's no option in settings.)</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of rhyme as to how and when the issue presents itself at the moment, but with the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 the rumble <em>can</em> become very intensive for entire scenes, and it appears as though a sustained rumble, for around a minute, is what's causing the issue. Perhaps the best bet, certainly with regards to CD Projekt Red's game, is to turn the rumble down in-game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/switch-2-joy-con-hd-rumble-wont-be-as-loud-as-it-was-on-switch">already discussed the decreased the volume of rumble</a> on Switch 2, so it's obviously an aspect of the machine they've been spending a lot of time refining and keeping an eye on. We've reached out to Nintendo asking about the exact conditions and reasons for this warning to pop up - we'll keep you posted with any updates.</p>
<p><em>Have you had the HD Rumble message pop up on your Switch 2 during game yet? Let us know!</em></p>

<figure><a title="rdr2 switch 2 rumour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fbc779527923c/rdr2-switch-2-rumour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been hearing rumours about a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> for a while now and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">recently some reports have been sounding the bell</a> that the game will arrive on the console before March 2026.</p>
<p>And so, when the actor who voices John Marston announces that there's gonna be some big Red Dead Redemption 2 news this week, well, listen here partner, we're gonna sit up straight on our nags and pay attention, y'hear? <strong>*spit*</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Rob Wiethoff, who's delivered some of the best lines in video game, let's face it (<em>"Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. Ain't nothing fair,"</em> goes hard right now), was doing a little bit of streaming of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> when he dropped a few tidbits of very exciting — or potentially very exciting — news, especially if it happens to relate to a certain new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fjyigun&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO48QYAS9Kg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>You can check out the clip from the stream, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/red-dead/while-streaming-red-dead-redemption-john-marstons-actor-teases-exciting-news-coming-this-week-and-he-cannot-wait-for-you-to-know-whats-going-on/">which has been doing the rounds on Reddit</a>, with Wiethoff commenting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've got such exciting news...I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing me. By the end of this week, hopefully sooner...definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness...the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on, and that's all I can say. That's the only thing I can think about right now, and you'll know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He seems pretty excited. So, with those Switch 2/next-gen revamp rumours already swirling, are early Switch 2 owners about to get a big cowboy-shaped surprise over the next few days? Goddammit, we sure do hope so, Dutch.</p>
<p>Of course, the OG Red Dead Redemption is already out on Switch. This writer even reviewed it back at launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Rockstar's%20Western%20epic%20holds%20up%20surprisingly%20well,%20its%20story%20is%20as%20powerful%20as%20ever,%20its%20knockabout%20action%20still%20feels%20great,%20and%20it%20looks%20and%20plays%20perfectly%20well%20on%20Nintendo's%20console.">giving it an 8/10</a> and calling it a barebones port (with no multiplayer) that nevertheless "still feels great, and looks and plays perfectly well on Nintendo's console."</p>
