<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> is just about to launch on the Switch 2, and to celebrate, Sega has announced another new DLC expansion scheduled to launch this winter.</p>
<p>Dubbed 'Zooseum', it's essentially, well... a zoo. It's a brand new location that will no doubt introduce a smorgasbord of interesting creatures to care for as you look to expand your blossoming museum even further.</p>
<p>Details are rather scarce at the moment, so we don't have a firm release date for the expansion just yet, but it's nice to know that it's coming, at least.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this wild new DLC, a brand new museum location dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife will open its doors. Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our recent review for Two Point Museum, we said that it's probably the best entry in the series yet, but lamented the lack of mouse controls and some apparent performance issues on the Switch 2. Be sure to read our full verdict if you're currently on the fence.</p>

In fact, it has put up the US' biggest physical game launch in over two years.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.circana.com/gb">Circana</a>'s Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">Bluesky</a>, who noted that the US hasn't seen a launch like Z-A's since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> arrived back on the scene in May 2023.</p>
<p>We should note that the data only accounts for "physical unit and dollar sales" and <em>not</em> digital or bundle purchases, but nonetheless, standing up there with TOTK — one of the most-anticipated games in recent memory — isn't bad going.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59hgjukq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there might be a bit of you thinking "well, duh, it's Pokémon, <em>obviously</em> it sold well," and you'd be right... for the most part. As we alluded to earlier, Z-A's release numbers are far from what the series has mustered in the past. In Europe, the game's racked up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">smallest retail launch for a mainline game</a> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Let's Go! Pikachu and Let's Go! Eevee</a>, and while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/japanese-charts-surprise-surprise-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust">Japanese numbers</a> are impressive, it's <em>far</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>'s debut.</p>
<p>All this is to say, even a quieter Pokémon launch is still a rather big deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p>
