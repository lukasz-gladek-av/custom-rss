<p>Earlier today, Nintendo announced it was releasing a new range of Mario-themed products, and while it is marketed towards parents and children, the 'wood block' sets on the way will actually double as amiibo figures.</p>
<p>Along with the news, it's shared multiple photos of this new range made up of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and various items from the Mushroom Kingdom (including Stars, Fire Flowers, and even a music block). We've also got the dimensions, with the Mario block 8cm in height.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Characters such as Mario and Luigi, along with well-known items from the Super Mario series will be available as wooden blocks. These pieces are all made in sizes and weights that are easy for young children to hold and play with. Each character blocks can also be used as an amiibo figure of the relevant character in compatible games."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067krnhmg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it's releasing a new line of Mario-themed products, videos and even an app designed for parents and their children.</p>
<p>The free smart device and Switch app is officially titled '<strong>Hello, Mario!</strong>' and allows kids to interact with Mario's face. Based on the description <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/app/index.html">and footage so far</a>, it looks a bit like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> start menu feature, allowing you to interact with a 3D version of Mario's head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<figure><a title="Hello, Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f7ed70ea1d81/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This app will be made available for free on both of these platforms on <strong>26th August 2025</strong> and is published by Nintendo. It will require "iOS 15 or Android 6.0 or later" to play.</p>
<p>As for the rest of this "My Mario" line, Nintendo is also releasing two wooden block sets and a 'Hello, Mario!' Board Book. One small but interesting detail about the wooden block sets is that each of the characters can be used as an amiibo figure in "compatible games".</p>

<p>Along with this, it's also got some visual content lined up, including a series of 'It's Me, Mario!' stop-motion short videos.</p>
<p>This will feature Mario showing off "a variety of expressions and movements" with each video approximately one minute in length. These will air for free on the 'My Mario' official website and "other" channels.</p>

<p>Nintendo also has some other products planned such as apparel, general goods and plush toys. This same series is scheduled to be released outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. This news arrives ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary celebrations this September.</p>

<p>Patents don't always lead to something, but it's still interesting to see what companies might be up to or at least thinking about behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In the case of Switch 2, Nintendo has already delivered some unique features like Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, and now a few other ideas have seemingly surfaced. This information comes from the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lvtbv7atlk2l">via Nintendo Patents Watch on social media</a>), which highlights attachments for a "crank" and what's described as a "clickable wheel".</p>
<p>The crank has a "rotary disc which is tracked by the mouse sensor through a window", with two magnets securing the attachment. According to the same source, the "clickable wheel" rotation is tracked by the mouse sensor via a gear train and "its click is transmitted to the SL button". This attachment also includes a second button to press the SR button.</p>

<p>As for what this could lead to...one obvious guess is some sort of fishing-like accessory and game. Some other suggestions online are joking about Nintendo channelling the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/playdate-picking-things-up-where-the-game-boy-left-off?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Playdate's crank</a>. If we do see anything come of this, or get more information about what might be going on here, we'll let you know.</p>
