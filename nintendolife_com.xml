<p>The Switch 2 physical is a Game-Key Card</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're planning on getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/digimon-story-time-stranger">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> for the original Switch, in case you missed it, there'll be an upgrade similar to what Bandai Namco offered with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_sparking_zero">Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! ZERO</a>.</p>
<p>If you boot up the Switch version of the title on the Switch 2, you'll be able to download a free update that will give you graphical improvements, which are the equivalent of the Switch 2 version. Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When playing the Nintendo Switch version of Digimon Story Time Stranger on the Nintendo Switch 2 version...Graphics will be improved to the equivalent of the Nintendo Switch 2 version after downloading the update data."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="228312d27cadc"><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/228312d27cadc/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As previously noted, on Switch 2, you'll have access to 'Performance' and 'Quality' mode options, and if you return to the Switch version, the "graphics will revert" and these options will not be available. Here are the resolution and performance specs once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Nintendo Switch 2, players will have the option of playing in Quality Mode (4K HDR, up to 30FPS docked; Full HD, up to 30FPS handheld) or Performance Mode (Full HD, up to 60FPS docked and handheld)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to online listings, the Switch 2 version of this title is a Game-Key Card while the original Switch version is a full physical release. So if you're a collector, the Switch release might be your best option when the game launches on these platforms in July.</p>
<p>In some other Bandai Namco news from the latest Partner Showcase, the company announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise</a> is on the way to the Switch 2 this May.</p>

<p>"Stop an alien threat from destroying all human life"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year, during The Game Awards, it was announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/saber-interactive">talented team at Saber Interactive</a> would be reviving the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok</a> IP with a new game known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an update during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo's latest Partner Showcase</a>, it's been revealed the new sci-fi shooter (featuring both first and third-person perspectives) will be releasing on the Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Here's some information about the intergalactic story, which will see you fighting for survival against a terrifying alien threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Turok: Origins,</em> players will take on the mantle of the ancient Order of the Turok, heroic guardians of unimaginable power locked in a battle for survival against ferocious creatures and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all human life in the galaxy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guardians will be able to fight solo or in online co-op as they take on a variety of creatures, dinosaurs and bosses across a range of environments. There will also be the ability to unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry and DNA Powers.</p>
<p>Saber is the same team that worked on and helped out with multiple ports during the Switch generation including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/world_war_z">World War Z</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crysis_remastered">Crysis Remastered</a>.</p>

<p>Releasing in Japan this July</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of the Goemon and Mystical Ninja series, there was a rather exciting 40th anniversary announcement shared during this week's Japanese Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>Konami and the <a href="https://x.com/M2_game/status/2019429197727572111">emulation experts at M2</a> are teaming up to release <strong>Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugo</strong> - a new retro collection coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms in Japan on <strong>2nd July 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This package will include 13 titles from across the series. More specifically, it includes releases from the Famicom, Super Famicom and Game Boy era. Here's the full list (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/02/japanese-fans-are-getting-a-ganbare-goemon-collection-and-weve-never-been-more-jealous">thanks, <strong>Time Extension</strong></a>):</p>

<p>Once again, the catch is that this collection has only been announced for Japan.

<p>In some other Partner Showcase news, Konami also announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> and it's available right now (and locally) on the Switch eShop.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is now available. If you are wondering how the Switch 2 version holds up, the <a href="https://youtu.be/V5Ai1Zg4jGU?t=21">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has released a side-by-side graphics and performance comparison, showing it alongside the original Switch release.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition runs at 4K at 60fps docked, and there's also a 120fps option - lowering the game's resolution to 1080p. As for handheld mode, players can expect a bump from 720p on Switch to 1080p on the Switch 2, with the game running at 120fps. You can see it in motion in the video above.</p>
<p>As also displayed, the game's frame rate on the Switch 2 is mostly consistent when it comes to reaching its target frames, even on the higher 120fps setting. As we mentioned in the announcement post, this is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/surprise-hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-today">free upgrade</a> if you already own the Switch version of the title. You can access this download from the eShop.</p>
<p>And if you don't own Hollow Knight on either of these platforms, it will set you back <strong>$15.00 / £10.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent).</p>
