<p>"The work of The Traveler is eternal"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you happened to miss it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2, and it's really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">rather good</a>.</p>
<p>Despite leaning heavily on tried-and-tested survival horror tropes, Bloober Team's latest delivers a fascinating story involving time travel, big helmets, and gross, gooey creatures that have the ability to merge with dead bodies. Gross. If you're a genre fan or you simply enjoy well-told stories, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>To highlight its support for the Switch 2, Bloober Team has concocted an awesome new live-action trailer that showcases the game's two timelines while demonstrating multiple methods of control, including the Switch 2's mouse mode. You can watch it first right here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest new IP from Bloober, with the team recently garnering critical acclaim for its work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake on PS5. It's been confirmed that a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> is also in the works, but we sincerely hope that Bloober is keen to expand the world of Cronos in the future too.</p>

<p>60 minutes of Switch and Switch 2 news</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a8a22963cba0/nintendo-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well it's that time again, folks! Nintendo has announced via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> that yet <em>another</em> Direct presentation will be taking place on <strong>12th September 2025</strong> (yes, that's this Friday), hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> in August.</p>
<p>The showcase is set to kick off at <strong>2</strong><strong>pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am ET / 6am PT</strong> and will provide 60 minutes' worth of news and announcements on games heading to the Switch 2 (and possibly the Switch). You can find the exact time that things get underway in your region below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PDT / 7am MDT / 8am CDT / 9am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CEST / 4pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10pm JST / 9pm AWST / 11pm AEST</li></ul>

<p>As ever, the full presentation will be streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional variant), and we'll also be hosting a stream right here on Nintendo Life, so you can watch along with us and have a good old natter about all of the announcements.</p>

<p>As for what's in store..? Well, who knows. There are known quantities like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, the former of which arguably <em>needs</em> a release date at this point. Probably both of them, actually. But of course, there's likely to be a few brand-new surprises in store for 2026, too.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of Super Mario's 40th Anniversary. Kind of a big deal, y'know? Nintendo announced quite a few neat little things for the plumber's 35th anniversary, including the likes of the <strong>Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros.</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch. We're expecting big things for this latest milestone.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-dead-reset-switch-a-gory-sci-fi-take-on-groundhog-day.1293477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Developer Wales Interactive is back with another FMV game, this time joining forces with movie studio <a href="https://darkrifthorror.com/">Dark Rift Horror</a> to present an <strong>Alien</strong>-inspired sci-fi romp with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dead_reset">Dead Reset</a>. Much like previous titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bunker">The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_dates">Five Dates</a>, this latest effort has you make key choices at frequent intervals to influence the story and, in this case, maybe survive the horrors ahead.</p>
<p>Spoiler: You won’t survive. Y’see, as the title suggests, Dead Reset is set within a time loop, with protagonist Cole Mason reliving the same moments over and over again with each subsequent death – sort of like <strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong>, then. Taking place within a dilapidated sci-fi lab of sorts, Cole discovers that a series of experiments has led to the birth of a deadly, gruesome monster; one that emerges from the chest of a helpless victim, no less. Remind you of anything?</p>
<p>Choices made throughout the story have an effect on how the supporting characters view Cole, and these include the headstrong sidekick Fearne, the brash, trigger-happy mercenary Slade, the cold, calculating scientist Magson, and more. From a morality standpoint, it’s often obvious what kind of choice needs to be made, but Dead Reset wisely keeps you on your toes by throwing in a few surprising punishments here and there – many of which result in your bloody death.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, Dead Reset is pretty grim, with blood and guts flying all over the place. However, many of the death scenes became quite funny in a <em>“Gosh, I won’t be doing</em> that <em>again”</em> kind of way. Pacing remains fairly solid, meaning you’re not waiting around too long for the story to get going again upon each reset.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the magic of storytelling, not every loop sends you right back to the beginning, because <em>jeez</em>, that would be terrible. Instead, you hit natural checkpoints along the way which make each subsequent death feel slightly less devastating. Overall, Dead Reset tells a compelling story that kept me locked in for its duration, and there’s definitely value in tracking down each of the four endings, along with the <em>*checks PR notes*</em> 337 unique scenes available.</p>
<p>As for general production, the image quality is superb throughout. The set design is decent, though you can definitely tell that it’s low-budget at times; the valves on the doors look like they’ve been carved out of tin cans. The performances are also a little mixed, with Daniel Thrace and Lyndsey Craine doing an admirable job throughout, while Andrina Carroll often struggles to sell the motivations of antagonist Magson.</p>
<p>It's a Switch release, although those playing on Switch 2 will need to, uh… consider not for now. The game frequently freezes, sometimes indefinitely, and although Wales Interactive is fully aware of this, the team is currently unable to apply a fix thanks to the lack of dev kits. Performance on Switch 1, mind you, is mostly fine. I experienced one of the aforementioned freezes, but it wasn’t a particularly lengthy one.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset]]></content:encoded>
