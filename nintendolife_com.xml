<figure data-uuid="580a5af1e1787"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza DLC Event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/580a5af1e1787/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the debut <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Emerald Rush</a> event wrapped up earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s <em>second</em> DLC in-game event is getting off to the races next week, with two particularly swanky reward statues up for grabs.</p>
<p>The 'So Strong It's Funny' event will get underway on <strong>25th November</strong> and will be hanging around until <strong>2nd December</strong>, so you have just one week to rack up a high score and pull in the bonus goodies.</p>
<p>And gosh, are there some goodies this time. As was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/two-classic-donkey-kong-icons-may-soon-join-bananza-as-unlockable-figures">previously rumoured</a>, the upcoming event's in-game statues are modelled on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK 64</a>'s Chunky and Lanky Kong. Finally, we can decorate DK Island with a small slice of the iconic duo... albeit only as inanimate objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4zoqhtx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>You'll find the precise times that the event gets underway in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Much like the last Emerald Rush challenge, 'So Strong It's Funny' adds a tactical twist to the game mode's usually randomised elements, cutting the pool of possible upgrade perks and skills down to a pre-determined list. It looks like it'll only be 'Groove' upgrades up for grabs this time, so expect to be picking up Emeralds in style.</p>
<p>And for those wondering, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e5d5c669-a123-408e-bbd1-1e8a390cbef8">Japanese Nintendo website</a> promises that there is <em>another</em> in-game event coming our way before 2025 is up. Hey, whatever it takes to beef up that DLC package a little.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d5a922d8707e4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5a922d8707e4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It came during the night. From the darkest, most existentially tortured recesses of a Game Freak designer’s brain. Diffidently, at first, then more boldly. Finally, hips swishing, stripper heels glittering, it announced itself across the Internet in a burst of dramatics. I am speaking, of course, of Mega Starmie, the breakout Internet star of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Mega Starmie frightened us. In its first official days of life, its long, powerful legs and humanoid gait evoked images of runway models, male, female, or otherwise; however, its lack of a head seemed at odds with this, confusing anyone who had liked those legs. <em>“Am I attracted to Mega Starmie?”</em> asked certain players, before ultimately dismissing Mega Starmie as a valiant yet unfinished design. Certainly, it was not something that they had thought of sexually when alone and three drinks in, staring out the window during a rainstorm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yqsiul&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Next came the memes. They cast Mega Starmie as an outsider, an abomination, a sentient pair of legs with no real purpose for existing. And man, those legs took a beating. Every joke seemed to zero in on this one physical trait over which Mega Starmie had no real control.</p>
<p>They compared Mega Starmie to Patrick from <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants</strong>. They claimed that Mega Starmie was a bug the programmers had forgotten to address. They suggested Mega Starmie was physically violent. No one ever stopped to think about how this made Mega Starmie feel.</p>

<p>But it’s always darkest before dawn, and Mega Starmie began to build a cult of personality. Perhaps it was the meme of Mega Starmie as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fno-one-will-ever-convince-me-mega-starmie-is-bad-v0-nrjp2t8wqxxf1.png">Patrick in sexy fishnets</a>; perhaps it was Mega Starmie’s status as an underdog, spurned by society. Perhaps it was because of Mega Starmie’s Pokédex entry, which suggested that it had become more humanoid “to supplant humanity.” To break the wheel.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Mega Starmie began to assume the role of a self-possessed rebel imbued with feminine power. A symbol of resistance. A queer icon.</p>

<p>Queer cosplayers across the Internet started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weeeelson/video/7568166463383571725">dressing as Mega Starmie</a>, both for Halloween and just to terrorise their conservative relatives. Awarding her the pronouns of she/her, they recast her as the protagonist of a new, celebratory strain of memes, positioning her as a SheEO and arbiter of taste. She appeared in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/1okhu8j/gayirl/"><strong>Devil Wears Prada</strong> memes</a>, <strong>Bridesmaids</strong> memes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/3152153-mega-starmie">Jean Claude Van Damme memes</a>. Drag queens learned how to paint like Mega Starmie and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP9-eQFEktz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">constructed entire garments</a> to evoke her potent, otherworldly glamour.</p>
<p>Finally, Mega Starmie had a purpose in life: to slay.</p>

<p>Regular Starmie has already been memed before, of course. Once the Internet caught on to its vaguely sexual cries in French dubs of the original Pokémon series, people had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dOzdKjux6vI">field day.</a> But even French Starmie’s sex positivity and certified freak status weren’t enough to make it into a queer icon.</p>
<p>This time around, things are different. Mega Starmie is a former reject of society, excluded for her very nature. She didn’t choose to have long, muscular legs. She was born this way.</p>
<p>It also helps that Regular Starmie was already a queer icon of sorts before Legends: Z-A came out. Thanks to its officially genderless status according to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/starmie">the National Pokédex</a> and its purple-and-yellow colouring, which evokes the non-binary flag, Regular Starmie <a href="https://adobe-outdesign.tumblr.com/post/686157350094192640/starmie-has-been-referred-to-as-a-non-binary">has already been</a> a non-binary icon for many.</p>

<p>In fact, its former status has inspired passionate questions about how Mega Starmie should identify now in terms of its pronouns. Is Mega Starmie she/her? Or is Mega Starmie they/them? Perhaps she/they are comfortable with both labels and will accept either.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that Mega Starmie is nothing if not passionate about making her gender identity non-controversial. For this reason, I believe that she’s a she/they who uses any <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guilhernunes.bsky.social/post/3m3dnvqn3q22z">discussion surrounding her labels</a> as an opportunity to educate her friends and provoke her haters, in a non-pedantic way.</p>
<p>And just like non-binary and trans people these days, Mega Starmie has often been misunderstood and even feared by the general populace. I mean, it’s not like she’s turning children gay by breathing on them, or Hydro Pump-ing every man she sees; a lot of the time, she’s just trying to teleport up to her trainer as he completes yet another scaffolding obstacle course. And we’re going to snicker behind her back? Wow.</p>

<p>Whatever people say about her, Mega Starmie is thriving these days. And she may even have a love interest soon. Word on the street is that Mega Malamar has also been claimed as a queer icon, one that’s even more out and proud than Mega Starmie. In one meme, Mega Malamar can be seen using his psychic powers to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DObbGIYCK3-/?hl=en">spread gay rights around the world</a>. Honestly, he sounds like a perfect match for Meg. They can attend rallies together.</p>
<p>Also, the world needs another ludicrous fictional couple to root for now that Pennywise and the Babadook have parted ways. At least, I assume they have. I used to check every year but I haven’t in a while. Maybe that’s because my mental health has improved.</p>
<p>And maybe <em>that’s</em> because I know that there’s a Mega Starmie out there somewhere, watching over the queers, singing <strong>God Help the Outcasts</strong> as she struts down Centrico Plaza, Mega Kick-ing anyone who doesn’t have a Pride flag on their porch.</p>
