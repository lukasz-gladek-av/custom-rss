<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWRt-PiOzlI">Digital Foundry</a> has presented its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> on the Switch 2, with the latest generation receiving a pretty substantial performance update for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>All things considered, it seems that this has proven to be a pretty positive outcome for the games (though one that, in this writer's opinion, arrived far too late), with visual quality and frame rates receiving significant boosts.</p>
<p>To start off, the games' visuals are much cleaner than before and, according to DF, "hold up well on a 4K television set". Shimmering has more or less been eliminated, with a solid 1080p internal resolution at play. Though not definitively confirmed, it's speculated that the game is likely making use of Nvidia's DLSS technology to boost the visuals slightly.</p><p><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Frame rate is also a huge improvement, running at a decent 60fps for the most part. There are some dips here and there – particularly during busy scenes – but it's a night and day difference when compared to the sub-30fps you would expect to see on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, distant characters and objects now move in full animation sequences, rather than the weird, jittering animation seen on Switch 1. This can be applied to trainers walking in the open world and even the infamous windmill, which now runs smoothly at far distances. Loading times are also much better, with fast travel now taking on average between 3 and 4 seconds each time, whereas you could be looking at anything up to 15 seconds on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>A few areas haven't been touched, though. Draw distances are largely the same across both consoles, while pop in is also still a bit of an issue on the Switch 2. The Pokémon still aren't persistent either, so if you happen to leave a specific area, the same Pokémon you saw previously won't remain there upon return. Keep an eye out for those shinies.</p>
<p>Overall though, it's a much-needed improvement, and actually makes playing Scarlet and Violet quite a pleasurable experience when compared to the Switch 1. It still looks kinda rough, of course, with blocky textures and bland environments, but performance-wise, this is very welcome, indeed.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Peach With Crown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/925a12a337173/mario-kart-world-peach-with-crown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is still going strong over in Japan, and thanks to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/45298">Famitsu</a>, we have the lowdown on the week's physical and console sales.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, for the second week in a row, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> takes pole position by shifting another 134,900 copies in the week of 9th to 16th June. That's over 120k more than the next closest competitor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which sold another 11,217 copies this week. Absolutely nothing to sneeze at. We wouldn't be surprised if it hit a million next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>'s Switch 1 version continues to do well, selling over 50k units since launch (almost another 10k this week), with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> rounding out the top five.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Switch 2 Editions have also made the top ten again, with BOTW edging out its sequel by a <em>single</em> sale. And aside from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, it's an entire Nintendo sweep.</p>
<p>No newcomers this week, so let's look at the full breakdown for the top ten:</p>

<hr>
<p>The big headline with the hardware here is that the Switch 2 has sold over a million units <em>already</em>. With a further 153,205 consoles selling this week, that's a total of 1.1 million Switch 2s sold in Japan alone. That's extremely impressive.</p>
<p>In terms of the Switch 1, it's still selling pretty well, shifting over 13k units this week alone. However, the PS5 (combined OG model, Pro, and Digital units) has surpassed it, selling over 15k consoles between its three SKUs.</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45f84f9f16719/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report from Chris Dring's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=166316380&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=357pt4&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a> highlights a few sales stats for launch games on the recently-released Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the article, "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers" at launch, with the vast majority of players understandably gravitating towards <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. As per data from NielsenIQ, 86% of physical Switch 2 game sales were first-party, including the MK World bundle. If we exclude the bundle, the result would be 48%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the US, Circana states that 68% of sales were for first-party, excluding the bundle. By comparison, launch sales for the Switch 1 were 89% first-party in the UK and 81% in the US. So yes, while these numbers have dropped, it's important to note that there are far more physical Switch 2 launch games than there were Switch 1 launch games.</p>
<p>The best-selling third-party game was, as most would probably expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>. Meanwhile, Sega is the third biggest third-party publisher for the Switch 2 with launch titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>However, one unnamed publisher described initial sales as "below our lowest estimates", despite remarkably strong hardware sales.</p>
<p>It's thought that there could be a few potential reasons behind this. The first is that, as mentioned earlier, most people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games, first and foremost. The second is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, with many Switch 1 titles performing better on the new hardware, thus eliminating the immediate need to buy more new games.</p>
<p>The third is that most third-party games are indeed ports of older games that a lot of folks may have already played. Fourth, the vast majority of third-party titles are Game-Key Cards, which passionate fans have been against from the word go. This may have also contributed to Cyberpunk's higher sales, which notably includes the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo's decision to hold back review units of the Switch 2 until the very last moment meant that consumers had no way to gauge just how viable the third-party games would be. Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination</a>, for example: a strong game to showcase the Switch 2 on paper, sure, but one that falls short with some pretty dismal frame rate issues.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how sales shake out over the coming months, but with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> coming out this year from Nintendo, we suspect third-parties may continue to feel the sting for a little while longer.</p>
