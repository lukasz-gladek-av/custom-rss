<p>Seven Up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> make an appearance at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct back in April, and now Square Enix has drip-fed us a <em>little</em> more information about when we can expect to see it come our way.</p>
<p>At last night's Xbox Games Showcase, the studio revealed that the remake will be arriving on Switch 2 (and Xbox, obvs) at some point <strong>this Winter</strong>. It's far from a precise release date — heck, even a month would have been nice — but at least it's something.</p>
<p>For those who missed the initial announcement, Intergrade is billed as a "visually enhanced edition" of the ace 2020 title, which was itself a remake of the classic PS1 RPG. It's all a little confusing, but expect plenty of action, melodrama, glossy hair, and some of the biggest swords going.</p>
<p>This version also packs in the 'FF7R EPISODE INTERmission' storyline, which sees you play as ninja Yuffie Kisaragi on her mission to infiltrate Midgar's Shinra Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>All in all, we're rather excited to see what this one has to offer on Switch 2 this winter. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> seemed pretty up on Intergrade when it first arrived on PS5 back in 2021, calling it "a game of ups and downs in terms of quality, but by the time the credits roll, its most memorable moments shine through — of which there are many" in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">review</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="nms mp issues" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/511d39d642ab6/nms-mp-issues.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, the big new Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of Hello Games' ever-evolving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> is now in the wild, and it's certainly looking like a much slicker, smoother experience on Nintendo's powered-up platform. Indeed, we're planning a full review in due course, so sit tight on that while we work our way through the launch games.</p>
<p>However! It appears all is not well with this new version of the game. We guess bugs are to be expected with titles of this size on platforms this new, though this is quite a biggie. Indeed, as of right now, the multiplayer aspect of the game, which includes playing online with pals, as well as being tied to other in-game discovery elements, seems to be completely broken.</p>

<p>After seeing reports online, we jumped in and ran into the issue ourselves, with our game telling us that it has no connection to any matchmaking services, as shown in our pic above. As it turns out, it's been a whole thing since the game dropped a few days ago, with players taking to various forums and social media to voice their concerns having run into the exact same issue.</p>


<p>The woes continue, too, as it seems cross-saves are also causing issues, although this one is easier to explain, as it's due to various platforms running on different numbered versions of the game. So, we'll need to wait for the Switch 2 version to be brought in line, it seems, to fix that one.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Hello Games about the issues, and will update you as soon as we hear anything. We do reckon they'll be getting this snafu sorted fairly quick-smart, though, given it's quite a serious one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Classic Atari 2600 Title 'Adventure' Is Being Revived As A Metroidvania]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania.1213641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We must admit, when Atari announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> over the weekend, it took us a good couple of minutes to realise it was officially linked to the classic 2600 game <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the trailer, the overall look and feel of the game didn't really form any connections in our mind, but then the title came up and we thought <em>"heh, Adventure of Samsara from Atari, that's kinda like the original Adventure"</em>. Slumped in chairs after caning the Switch 2 for a few days, the penny finally dropped.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Adventure of Samsara is, according to Atari, a completely new game set in the world of Adventure. In other words, then, it's neither a sequel not a remake. It is, however, a metroidvania, kinda like what the company did with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yars_rising">Yars Rising</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by indie studio Ilex Games, Adventure of Samsara will see you traverse 10 unique biomes with gameplay reminiscent of classic Prince of Persia titles. And, of course, for those who recovered the Enchanted Chalice and perhaps discovered Warren Robinett's hidden room in the original 1980 game, there will be plenty of curious easter eggs to discover.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</p>
<p>- <strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.</p>
<p>- <strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</p>
<p>- <strong>Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</p>
<p>- <strong>Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no date for Adventure of Samsara yet beyond the current 2025 window, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
