<p>Square Enix's new HD-2D RPG starring YOU</p>

<figure data-uuid="12de99f7e2a05"><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12de99f7e2a05/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a busy period for gaming recently, and Square Enix is back this week another role-playing release. Following on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</a> Remake in October, we've now got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which this time puts you in the shoes of your very own custom character.</p>
<p>This game is releasing on the Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December, and ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. It comes from the prestigious Japanese publication Famitsu. So, what did the critics think?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hpslvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This new entry in the series, which sees you become the hero, has received <strong>8/9/9/8</strong> from the four critics, giving it a total of <strong>34/40</strong>. In the same week, this puts it two points ahead of Famitsu's score for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (sitting on 32/40) and two points <em>behind</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which leads with a score of 36/40.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games on Switch, the first and second games both received scores of 36/40.</p>
<p>So, that's first review for the latest Octopath Traveler game! You can find out more about it, and see our own score, when our review goes live here on Nintendo Life later today. In case you missed it, there is also a demo available on the eShop, and your save data will carry over to the full game.</p>

<p>In July, The Pokémon Company and Wonderfy released the puzzle title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a> on Switch and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Today, the game has received an update for both platforms, bumping it up to Version 1.1.0. It contains not only a bunch of bug fixes but also adds new puzzles, plush, furniture and wallpapers to encourage even more customisation.</p>
<p>There are also many other changes to improve the overall experience, including the ability to now place 25 plush in the Switch version of the game (instead of being capped at 20 plush). Here's the full rundown of this latest update (via Nintendo Everything):</p>

<li><em>You can now get one yarn each day when you beat your record.</em></li>
<li><em>You can now get yarn when you reach level 6 of a puzzle for the first time.</em></li>

<p>You can check out our review of this title here on Nintendo Life. On mobile devices it's a free-to-play experience, but to play it on the Switch, you'll need to purchase the base package for £7.99 / $9.99. You can find out more about each version in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/surprise-a-brand-new-pokemon-puzzle-game-is-available-now-on-mobile-and-switch">original announcement post</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3b48478afafae"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b48478afafae/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've finally made it, folks! This week marks the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. After years of development, delays, and even a restart, Samus Aran's next 3D outing is officially here for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The critic reviews have also gone live ahead of the big release, and admittedly, the aggregate score has got a lot of people talking online. Prime 4 is currently sitting on 81/100 based on 74 critic reviews. At the time of writing, it's got the same "top critic" score on OpenCritic.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194688 @ 1764747508 -->
<p>This score technically makes Metroid Prime 4 the lowest-rated "mainline" Metroid Prime release on Metacritic. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-remastered">Switch remaster</a> of Retro Studios' first game received an aggregate score of 94/100 when it was released in 2023, and every other "major" entry in the Prime series has received a score of 90 or more.</p>
<p>As harsh as all of this may sound, it's still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">an "excellent" adventure in our books</a>, and we're not alone here – with some sites even awarding it a perfect score. Of course, these scores are focused on the Switch 2 version of the game. As you might have seen, we're currently working on getting our Switch review out the door as soon as possible. So be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194682 @ 1764744944 -->
<p>So, with the scores and lengthy wait time for this anticipated release in mind, we want to know if you will still be getting Metroid Prime 4: Beyond this week? Has anything in the lead up to this big release swayed your decision, or will you still be diving in day one? <em>Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193292 @ 1764747551 -->
<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system. It functions much closer to games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sims_4">The Sims</a> and allows you to completely change the size and shape of buildings by adding and moving walls, doors, windows, and roofs as well as all the usual interior decorations."</p>

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>
<figure data-uuid="a2baf6b5624a0"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2baf6b5624a0/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>
