It feels as though we can still sense the tight elastic of our tiny <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a> swimming trunks digging into our fresh summer sunburn, and yet <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-video-games-of-2025-1235469710/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-1235469717/">here comes Rolling Stone with its Best of 2025 list</a>, because it's nearly Christmas. Brace for impact!</p>
<p>Yes, Rolling Stone has dropped its 25 favourite gaming experiences of the year and, whilst the number one spot is absolutely no surprise (congratulations to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>), we've been tickled pink to see that good old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> has managed to secure a number three spot via all that wrecking shop he did in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Bananza</a>. The big man has smashed his way onto a prestigious podium there, so well done, Mr. Kong. And nice tie!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4tmluph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Elsewhere on the list, some 10 spaces down in fact, you'll spot another Switch 2-shaped mention in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Honestly, we probably wouldn't have expected that DK would outdo Master Mascot Mario in this way if you'd told us in the summer, but we'd tend to agree on the placement rolling (no pun intended) the great ape's way here.</p>
<p>What else has delighted us in making the cut? Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> dropping into a very nice 7th place is great, as that really was one of the year's big highlights on Switch, alongside the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a>, which has pulled off a blinder by snatching the number 2 spot.</p>

<p>Oh, and look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, all the way down (if you can be all the way down on a top 25 list) at number 12. That isn't perhaps where we'd have expected to see such a massively well-reviewed game, but personal taste is a wondrous and mysterious thing, innit!</p>
<p>With a total of 11 of these games available on Switch consoles, it's still a very strong showing for Nintendo gamers - and hopefully we'll see Switch ports of some of these soon!</p>

<p>A launch day special</p>

<figure data-uuid="8f55a0ad19c46"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f55a0ad19c46/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Eight years on from its big reveal, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally arrives on Switch 1 &amp; 2 tomorrow. To make sure that things are in tip-top condition, Nintendo has today released the launch day update, boosting things up to ver. 1.1.0 and adding a bunch of day-one features to boot.</p>
<p>This update adds in amiibo functionality, some sweet cinematic controller rumble, an easily accessible upgrade path to the Switch 2 Edition in the opening menu, some gallery tweaks, and then the usual adjustments and fixes.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the patch notes have only been shared on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch/software_support/bgw5a/110/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Support website</a>. We have included those below (via Google Translate), and we will sub-in the official English translation as soon as it is available.</p>
<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Ver. 1.1.0 (3rd Dec 2025)</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now use amiibo on the "amiibo" page in the pause menu.</li>
<li>Controller now vibrates during cinematics.</li>
<li><strong>[Switch 2]</strong>: When you start up Metroid Prime 4 Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2, a "Switch 2 Edition" option will now appear in the menu after the title screen. Selecting this option will take you to the Upgrade Path page on the Nintendo eShop.</li>
<li>The rating information for the rating system "ClassInd (Brazil)" has been updated from "12" to "14".</li>
<li>The condition for unlocking some movies in the "Gallery" has been changed from "achieving 100% item recovery rate" to "clearing the game."</li>
<li>In "Hard Mode," the difficulty of some enemies has been adjusted.</li>
<li>Additionally, we have made some adjustments and fixes to improve your gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>"After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>, describing Samus' latest adventure as "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date". Just one more sleep to go!</p>

<p>Well that's not suspicious at all!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8cd734bd57d33"><a title="Chrono Trigger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cd734bd57d33/chrono-trigger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>11th March 2025 marked the 30th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Square Enix marked the occasion by announcing that "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/chrono-trigger-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-with-various-projects">various projects</a>" would be coming our way over the next year, but so far, those projects have been limited to character popularity polls and planned orchestral concerts. Importantly, that's <em>not</em> the remake that we all want to see and have been chatting about for years. But we're still not ready to completely throw out all hope just yet.</p>
<p>You see, in the latest episode of the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&amp;t=6628s">KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku</a>' talk show livestream (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>), <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> creator and Chrono Trigger supervisor Yuji Horii attempted to keep his lips sealed about where the series is heading — but in saying nothing, has he actually said <em>everything</em>?</p>
<p>"I can't talk about that," Horii-san told the interviewer when asked whether the smaller anniversary events might be "foreshadowing" bigger developments down the line. He jokingly added clarifying statements like, "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!," "Don't ask!," and "I'll get in trouble!" before the panel decided to move on with the show.</p>
<p>Hmmm. It's far from anything concrete, and there's every chance that Horii-san was genuinely just trying to get himself out of a sticky situation, but we can't help feeling that the whole thing is a <em>little</em> suspicious. Hey, perhaps it's just wishful thinking on our end.</p>
<p>Back in May, it seemed like Horii-san might have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/oops-yuji-horii-may-not-have-leaked-massive-remake-news-after-all">let the news of an upcoming remake slip</a> during a panel at Napoli Comicon. However, it later turned out that it was just the translator bringing up the series, not Yuji Horii himself. <em>D'oh</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the best way to officially play Chrono Trigger remains the wonderful 2008 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chrono_trigger">DS port</a>, which'll set you back a pretty penny if you try to pick it up on the resale market today. It has arrived on mobile and Windows in the years since, but come on, we all want to see it on Switch (2), right?</p>
