It's been a busy one with a Nintendo Direct, a Pokémon Presents, and a couple of shadow drops and Switch 2 surprises. That means it's time for a lovely edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, a big month for what is the shortest one of the year. Spring is approaching, but that doesn't mean we want to start stepping outside and enjoying the crisp, early sunshine. There's a <em>lot</em> of games on the eShop right now, so let's look at the best of them.</p>
<p>So, the rules: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from February 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8xzinut&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable Mentions</h3>
<p>This past month gave us eight games to fight over for the top three positions, all scoring at least a 7/10 from us. A couple of them are getting physical releases later in the year, but as with previous iterations of this regular feature, they're eligible for the votes here.</p>
<p>Obviously Switch 2 Edition shadow drops graced us this month, but given that we haven't officially reviewed them, we've opted to exclude them from the vote this time around — sorry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of other game releases, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> just sneaked in at the end of the month, but we didn't have access to them before release so we're working on our review. And we also want to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which are <em>technically</em> available physically via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-generation-pack">Resident Evil Generation Pack</a> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So, let's give it up for the smaller releases that just missed out on the podium.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">3rd Place - Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>After months of rumours, was anyone surprised to see Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> pop up during Sony's State of Play in February? The most shocking part of the reveal was that it was also out within 24 hours of its announcement.</p>
<p>And yes, the collection does have a handful of issues in the form of music and a lack of variety in content, <em>but</em> as always with Digital Eclipse, the magic of the museum, the documentary-style clips, and the added bonuses make this a worthy celebration for an Ubisoft icon.</p>
<p>We hope those issues are fixed by the time the physical release rolls out, because the original Rayman deserves the best, hence its placement in the top three. For now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">it gets a 7/10 from us</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">2nd Place - The Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Wait, what's this? <em>Another</em> Digital Eclipse job? And this one goes even further back. We've been clamouring for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> on Switch, and we've been rewarded for our patience: with the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bonkers">Bonkers</a>, we now have eight retro classics to dig into on both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Really, Goof Troop is the star here, but we think most of the games in the compilation are great. If you grew up with any of these NES and SNES titles, then you'll <em>also</em> know that some of these games are darn tough. Thank goodness for rewind and some other QoL features then.</p>
<p>It really is a retro fan's dream, and a good reminder of some excellent classic Disney titles. We awarded the collection <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">an 8/10 in our review</a> for those reasons and more.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">1st Place - Caves of Qud (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>But Rayman and Disney are no match for 17 years of game development and one of the most-ambitious and rich roguelikes <em>ever</em>. After being in Early Access for a long time and releasing on Steam back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> made its console debut on Switch in February 2026 with very little compromised for the hybrid system.</p>
<p>Is it dense? Yes. Is it complex? Very. And is there a little too much squeezed onto the little screen at once? Maybe. But what Caves of Qud delivers is an incredibly rewarding experience for those who love good systems and good stories. It's tense, it's tough, but it's deeply satisfying.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">We gave Caves of Qud an 8/10</a>, and it sits at the top of the podium for February's eShop Selects. Congrats to Freehold Games for this monumental achievement!</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - January 2026</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-february-2026]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="651d040c05574"><a title="30 Pokémon You Probably Forgot That Deserve A Second Chance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/651d040c05574/30-pokemon-you-probably-forgot-that-deserve-a-second-chance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given Pokémon’s roaring popularity for three decades straight, it’s a sheer numbers game to figure that each of its titular beasts is someone’s favourite. It’s also true that over 1,000 Pokémon can’t all share the limelight, meaning some are bound to fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>While the most popular Pokémon take centre stage for the franchise’s 30th anniversary, I figured space should be made to honour the PokéMisfits that didn’t stand the test of time. These include oddities that only the staunchest Poké Maniacs will recall, others of minor notoriety that deserve more love, and phased-out mascots. While they may be easily written off as sideshows, these Pokémon still played roles (in some cases, infamously) in keeping the franchise on top for all these years.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fknlwui&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>Before jumping in, a quick note: I left out Gen 9 'newcomers' as their legacies are still being written. I also had regional variants, mega evolutions, and their ilk take a seat to keep the proceedings simpler.</p>
<h2>30 PokéMisfits That Deserve More Love</h2>
<p>First up, <strong><u>PokéWho?</u></strong></p>
<p>This category covers Pokémon that many straight-up forgot about. They’re sure to have their fans — that’s true of any Pokémon — but by and large, they never caught on, or only enjoyed fleeting relevancy...</p>
<div><div><h3>Shedinja (#292)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="aa775a7f274ee"><a title="Shedinja #292" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa775a7f274ee/shedinja-292.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one element of the Pokémon fandom that I’ll forever miss, it’s the schoolyard tall tales that kids told each other when we didn’t have easy internet access. By Gen 3, scepticism had set in, making me disbelieve Shedinja’s existence.</p>
<p>I have to keep a spot in my party empty and have a spare Poké Ball to obtain it? Sounded about as likely as finding Mew under a truck!</p>
<p>Of course, it does work… and that’s about the most I can say. Schoolyard chatter quickly moved on to new leaks and lies. Shedinja’s allure became its undoing as myths were far more compelling than truths. It’s now notable as a historical footnote and its unique Bug/Ghost dual-typing. That’s more than can be said for a lot of the entries in this category, but nonetheless disappointing for such a conceptually cool Pokémon.</p>
</div><div><h3>Klinklang #601</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7e781a410d085"><a title="Klinklang #601" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e781a410d085/klinklang-601.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not a lot working in Klinklang’s favour. Its design is simultaneously basic, even among Gen 5’s wave of inanimate object Pokémon, and also derivative of Magneton. It’s therefore not too surprising that this gearhead wouldn’t leave much of an impact.</p>
<p>However, I do believe it has the potential to earn a renewed residency in the minds of fans by having it utilise its utilitarian design to help keep the Pokémon world running. For example, imagine a city running on Klinglang-powered machinery, or gadgets that could be brought alive by a Klinglang in your party.</p>
<p>That sort of worldbuilding is what Klinglang is destined for.</p>
</div><div><h3>Zarude #893</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7c7b46306725f"><a title="Zarude #893" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c7b46306725f/zarude-893.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This mythical primate was never made available beyond a few online distribution events that occurred a year or more after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword and Shield</a> (let alone after both its expansion packs were available). It’s highly possible that most Sword and Shield players never even learned of Zarude’s existence because of its late addition. Many who did still had a hard time finding love in their heart for this monkey due to a lack of an in-game event to give it the context it desperately needed.</p>
<p>Zarude could see a renaissance if The Pokémon Company decides to reintroduce it with expanded prominence, but for now, it’s a bit of a non-entity.</p>
</div><div><h3>Dhelmise #781</h3>
<figure data-uuid="d90bb525b981a"><a title="Dhelmise #781" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90bb525b981a/dhelmise-781.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept behind Dhelmise is cool enough: a rusty, seaweed-strapped anchor that can supposedly knock out Wailord in one attack (Pokémon battles don’t back up this claim). The reality is that it’s ultimately just a possessed anchor, something that wasn’t particularly novel by the time of its Gen 7 introduction.</p>
<p>It’s well themed for the tropical Alolan archipelago, but then again, so are many of that region’s newcomers. Still, I give props to Game Freak for giving wacky ideas like this a shot, even if they don’t always catch on. For better or worse, they can’t all be Garbodor.</p>
</div><div><h3>Maractus #556</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f14d447f69b5b"><a title="Maractus #556" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14d447f69b5b/maractus-556.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the second Cactus Pokémon to lay its roots in the franchise, Maractus needed a bit more going for it to stand out. Namely, it’s a type of single-evolution Pokémon that feels like it shouldn’t be standalone. The design concept of maracas growing out of its head is the perfect setup for an evolution to run with.</p>
<p>Without one, it felt like borderline Gen. 5 filler added so that generation wouldn't include any old monsters until its post-game. I hoped that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Legends Z-A</a> might’ve given it a plus-up in the form of a mega evolution, but with that opportunity gone, who knows if Maractus will ever get the treatment it deserves.</p>
</div><div><h3>Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368</h3>
<figure data-uuid="50e749ef52d2c"><a title="Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/50e749ef52d2c/huntail-367-and-gorebyss-368.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>These two share an evolutionary base Pokémon in the adorable Clamperl, yet neither share in its fandom. In fact, it wasn’t until researching for this article that I remembered Clamperl even had evolutions at all!</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s because both require trading, which has always been a somewhat frustrating (even if understandably flavourful) barrier to using certain Pokémon, especially if you’re a solo player like me. I have to imagine that’s also true for many others whose only encounters with Huntail and Gorebyss came through trainer battles or rare in-the-wild scenarios.</p>
<p>It’s a shame because these groovy, psychedelic eels have been waiting over two decades for their moment in the sun. Or perhaps they just prefer the deep ocean, in which case, live your best lives, sea misfits.</p>
</div><div><h3>Stakataka #805</h3>
<figure data-uuid="c328a1aae3281"><a title="Stakataka #805" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c328a1aae3281/stakataka-805.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The alien nature of Ultra Beasts makes them all inherent misfits of the Pokémon universe, but that’s also why some have been fondly remembered. Stakataka isn’t usually part of those conversations, though. Its stone colossus design isn’t particularly original or memorable, especially when you consider that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> introduced the strikingly similar Guardians months prior.</p>
<p>Plus, appearing exclusively in 3DS games that launched after the Switch rocked the world was a surefire way to not rock the world. Still, if Ultra Beasts ever come back, Stakataka might find its footing.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Gen. 8 Fossil Quartet (Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0c4381891ac92"><a title="Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c4381891ac92/dracozolt-880-arctozolt-881-dracovish-882-and-arctovish-883.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Uhhhhhhh, so yeah.</p>
<p>First, for those keeping count at home, this is one of two scenarios where I’m lumping all four of these… Pokémon?... into one listing since they’re all cut from the same cloth of combining two fossils to create genetic monstrosities.</p>
<p>The Frankenstein creations that this resulted in might be more believable as something found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill</a>. In fact, their mere existence is that level of unsettling, which I suppose will be the feature for many players. For others, we’d rather forget.</p>
<p>That said, I’m open-minded. Game Freak, game on. The ball’s in your court to make me love these patchwork Pokémon.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next up, <strong><u>The Under-Appreciated Misfits.</u></strong></p>
<p>The Pokémon in this category have a steady presence in the franchise but don’t get the love they deserve. Whether they live in infamy or are overshadowed by their immediate peers, let’s give these beasties a second look on the second page...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Arcade Archives 2 Rave Racer (Switch 2) - The Pure Spirit Of Ridge Racer, Finally On Home Console]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer</link>
            <guid>1449868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There's part of me that still can't quite believe I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> on a home console. Namco's 1995 sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> never made it out of the arcades back in the day, despite promises that it would be ported to PC as part of NEC's push for its PowerVR graphics processor.</p>
<p>For years, the game's legacy has been having its circuits reproduced in later Ridge Racer games, but Rave Racer has finally been released from its arcade prison – and while its coin-op roots are both a plus and a minus, what we have here is perhaps the purist example of what makes this franchise so special.</p>
<p>Rave Racer consists of four circuits, two of which are taken from the original Ridge Racer (technically, they're variations on the same track, so in reality, there are, in fact, three courses on offer here). The City and Mountain courses would resurface in the PSP entries <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer_2">Ridge Racer 2</a></strong> as 'Midtown Expressway' and 'Greenpeak Highlands', while the City circuit would form the basis of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/ridge_racer_6">Ridge Racer 6's</a> Rave City.</p>
<p>You can choose to either race against 11 other cars or take part in Time Trial events, and it's even possible to race all of the circuits in reverse, thanks to a combination of button presses before selecting your track (right, right, then press the accelerator and brake simultaneously).</p>
<p>Manual and Automatic transmission options are available, and this release lets you compete against three other friends in split-screen mode that replicates the multi-cabinet link-up mode originally seen in arcades. There's also a two-player split-screen mode, too.</p>

<p>These features — alongside the traditional Time Attack, Caravan, and Hi Score modes the Arcade Archives series is famous for — do much to extend the longevity of Rave Racer, which, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Arcade Archives Ridge Racer</a> before it, can quickly become stale if you're not totally committed to perfecting your racing lines and tirelessly improving your track times. After all, this is a game that was designed for arcade and not home play.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progression and low number of circuits on offer, Rave Racer plays like an absolute dream. The handling model in this game is subtly different from that seen in Ridge Racer (and pretty much every other game in the lineage, for that matter); cars aggressively shift as they make sharp turns, and the camera itself tilts whenever you drift around a tight corner. Furthermore, there's an on-screen splitstream gauge that shows when you're benefiting from 'drafting' behind rival cars.</p>
<p>The drifting itself feels like it offers more bandwidth for player skill to emerge; it takes a little getting used to initially (especially for those of us weaned on the PS1 port of Ridge Racer, which was designed with digital and not analogue steering in mind), but after a few hours of play you fall into an almost subconcious 'flow state' and the whole experience becomes practically otherworldly.</p>
<p>Rave Racer isn't the perfect racing game, by any means; there's not a lot of content and no career mode, but the on-track action is as pure and exhilarating as any you'll encounter in the arcade racing sub-genre. And, in case you were wondering, yes, the game still has the bug which has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1RW0MTujA">allowed players to totally smash the game's course records.</a></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer]]></content:encoded>
