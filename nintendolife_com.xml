<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">published its latest business report</a> (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-series-sales-october-2025/">Persona Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/persona-5-games-wont-stop-selling-series-tops-13-million-sales">Push Square</a>), and the Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million units since its debut in 2016. That's up from 10 million back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/the-persona-5-series-has-shifted-over-10-million-copies-worldwide">December 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Series, you ask? Well, that includes the original PS3/4 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5_dancing_in_starlight">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. <strong>Persona 5: The Phantom X</strong>, the mobile game, was not developed by Atlus and is not included.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nZnuGRwfwx0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnZnuGRwfwx0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8f0nohxki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Back in August, <a href="https://p-ch.jp/news/20511/">Atlus JP announced</a> that Persona 5 and Personal 5 Royal had sold over 10 million copies alone, making up the huge bulk of that 13k figure, unsurprisingly.</p>

<p>Talking about the growth in repeat sales (for all of Sega's series), Sega says that "In recent years, games have tended to enjoy longer sales lifecycles, and with the growing share of digital downloads, sales of repeat titles have increased accordingly."</p>
<p>In terms of other Persona games that are available on Switch (or Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> now sits at 2.07 million sales, though these figures are based on sales prior to the Switch 2 version's release.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>are</em> getting a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a>, though that doesn't appear to be Nintendo bound at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if we'll get to see it on Switch 2.</p>

<figure data-uuid="47cdbbd114c96"><a title="RE Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47cdbbd114c96/re-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly following its official announcement, the Resident Evil Pro Controller for Switch 2 has become available to pre-order.</p>
<p>So if you're really keen on picking this up, you might want to get moving before it's sold out. Something's telling us, however, that this might not happen, because good <em>lord</em> is it expensive.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available in the UK at an eye-watering <strong>£83.99</strong> via the My Nintendo store, which is even more expensive than the regular Pro Controller at <strong>£74.99</strong>. Over in the US, meanwhile, Best Buy is currently offering pre-orders at <strong>$99.99</strong> – the price for the bog-standard Pro Controller over in the states is <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's an expensive one. Aesthetically, it's not a patch on the classic <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Controller">Chainsaw Controller</a> from the GameCube days, either, but we can't have everything, can we?</p>
<p>Truth be told, we do like the overall design, but man, that Switch 2 logo in the centre is really doing its best to ruin everything, huh? It's literally obscuring the Resident Evil title, alongside a whole bunch of cool iconography from the overall design.</p>
<p>Still, it's neat that Nintendo is willing to allow a third-party Pro Controller at all, and the fact that it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, of all things, is really cool.</p>
<p>Both the game and the Pro Controller will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. A Grace Ashcroft amiibo will follow later in the year during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>That's a lot of Poké Dollars</p>

<figure data-uuid="80f5633033e3f"><a title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80f5633033e3f/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> celebrated its first anniversary last week, and it has seemingly been quite the money maker (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>According to new estimates from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>, which accounts for in-app spending from Google Play and the App Store, TCG Pocket pulled in almost <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in its first year alone, making it the highest-grossing debut for a Pokémon mobile app to date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>'s first-year player spending estimates tend to sit around the big 'one billy' mark, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a> are drops in the ocean, comparatively.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn't really come as a big surprise. TCG Pocket racked up over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-surpassed-10-million-downloads-in-its-first-48-hours">10 million downloads in its first 48 hours</a> on the market, and it was quickly reported that the app was pulling in around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-already-bringing-in-the-big-bucks">$3 million per day</a> as it got off the start line.</p>
<p>That appetite will have obviously slowed down a little in the months since, but it looks like the consistent cadence of new expansions and feature updates has kept the Poké Dollars rolling in. Hey, they do say that you've got catch 'em all...</p>
<p>To mark its one-year anniversary, The Pokémon Company released a special video, revealing that TCG Pocket players have opened over 18 billion packs, competed in 12+ billion battles, made 96 million trades and much more besides. You'll find it in full below:</p>
