<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>
