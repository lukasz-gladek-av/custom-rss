</section></header><section>

<p>Puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a> launched on Switch last year, and we were particularly enamoured by it. Developer Wishfully quickly followed it up with the announcement of a sequel, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Children of the Leaf</a>', and the latest gameplay trailer promises it will be every bit as cute as we'd hope.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's Unity Awards Showcase, the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWoUwHXShgQ">Say hello to the Roller</a>' trailer introduces us to one of the many cute creatures you'll encounter on Lana and Mui's journey, one that possesses a particularly sticky set of skills.</p>
<p>Using Mui's transforming abilities, these cute fluff balls can stick to walls and ceilings, leave flammable trails, and roll along narrow corridors undetected. They are also really freaking cute, which is always a bonus — just try not to become too attached to them by the end of the trailer, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release date for Planet of Lana 2 just yet, though Wishfully and Thunderful have confirmed that it'll be coming our way at some point in <strong>early 2026</strong>. That leaves you a good bit of time to catch up on its predecessor, if you haven't already, which we described as "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan – perhaps even destined to join that short list of classics" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

<p>Is Larian's popular role-playing series back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8199459c2ebe6"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8199459c2ebe6/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're just days out from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a>, and one marketing stunt that's got <em>a lot</em> of attention in the lead up to the show is a mysterious statue located in the middle of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>It's ignited plenty of speculation online, and now a trio of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity</a> trademarks, which were filed in Europe on 9th December 2025, appear to confirm it's an announcement related to Larian's popular role-playing series. As you can see below, the symbols match the statue:</p>
<figure data-uuid="d33bce385024d"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33bce385024d/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: MP1st</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the news this week of a PlayStation 5 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</a> being added to Sony's servers. Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse responded to this, mentioning how the team <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">wasn't "meant to announce that yet"</a>. Douse has also supposedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/">ruled out Divinity Original Sin 3</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition were <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/new-divinity-logo-and-symbols-trademarked-matching-mystery-the-game-awards-2025-statue#google_vignette">rated by PEGI in November 2024</a>, but they haven't been released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmpug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/mystery-game-awards-reveal-is-a-new-divinity-rpg-as-riddle-is-finally-solved">our colleagues at Push Square</a> note, this could even be a "double-header" of announcements including "a re-release of Original Sin 2 on new-gen consoles and a fresh announcement for the franchise".</p>
<p>If we hear anything on the Nintendo front, we'll let you know. Larian previously released Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on the Switch eShop in 2019 (<a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/010027400cdc6000">and it's compatible with the Switch 2</a>), but we're sure many fans would embrace a next-generation upgrade.</p>

<figure data-uuid="08e7cef4211fb"><a title="Call of Duty" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08e7cef4211fb/call-of-duty.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we wait for something to come of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">10-year deal between Microsoft and Nintendo</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Call of Duty</a> team at Activision has today announced its strategy "going forward" is changing.</p>
<p>From here on out, the team will "no longer do back-to-back releases" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3">Modern Warfare</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> games. The aim is to provide a truly "unique experience" in each entry and "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmpug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>- We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p>
<p>- We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update on the series' future follows <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">negative fan reception</a> to the latest outing <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which launched in November.</p>
<p>Although this change could potentially impact the development cycle going forward, the Call of Duty team believes the future of the series is still "very strong". It also notes how it's already working on the "next era of Call of Duty", which it promises will deliver "precisely" what fans want, and some surprises to move the franchise "and the genre" forward.</p>
<p>Microsoft entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">deal made legally binding in 2023</a>. This followed with Microsoft being given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/microsoft-given-all-clear-in-the-us-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> in the same year.</p>
<p>More recently, Call of Duty job listings have popped up online seeking talent with Nintendo Switch experience.</p>

<p>Seeing red</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo shared a massive surprise in September, revealing it would be reviving the Virtual Boy for 'Nintendo Classics'.</p>
<p>This library will be joining the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service next year on <strong>17th February 2026</strong>, and if you haven't already made up your mind, here's your reminder that the headset (and the cardboard model) is now available on the My Nintendo Store in select regions.</p>
<p>Of course, to purchase these items, you'll need to be a paid Switch Online member. The more expensive unit will set you back <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong>, and the cheaper cardboard model is priced at <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>
