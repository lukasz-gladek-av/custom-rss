<p>A new month, a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> Booster Pack. That's a saying, right? It should be, because on 26th June 2025, we're getting another themed pack, and this time, it's all about Eevee.</p>
<p>Eevee Grove will be focusing on the adorable brown fluffy Pokémon and its eight evolutions — Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Glaceon, Leafeon, and Sylveon. Depending on your timezone, this is when the pack will be available to rip open over and over:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11pm (Wed) PDT / 12am MDT / 1am CDT / 2am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8am CEST / 9am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 4pm AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>These are fan-favourite 'mons, so we're sure lots of you will be very happy and scrambling to get some of those beautiful cards (Espeon and Umbreon are two of this writer's favourites, so she's considering a redownload right now...).</p>
<p>While many of the cards make a brief appearance in the trailer up top, we've got a more detailed look at a handful of them, including an ex, from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion">the official website</a>.</p>

<p>The cards aren't the only star of the update, either. Soon enough, a new binder cover and display board will also be available, featuring all nine of the Eevee family.</p>
<p>This Booster Pack follows on from last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-is-all-about-ultra-beasts">Ultra Beast-themed one</a>, which will still be around — just that Eevee is stealing the spotlight for now.</p>

<p>Though its publisher doesn't fill us with confidence</p>

<p>A new game based on the enduring <strong>Goosebumps</strong> book series has been announced for the Switch.</p>
<p>Launching in <strong>August 2025</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/goosebumps_terror_in_little_creek">Goosebumps: Terror in Little Creek</a> sees you take on the role of a teenager "caught in a town of nightmares", in which creatures and locations based on R.L. Stine's creations will look to thwart your progress at every turn.</p>
<p>Standard editions will cost £34.99/€39.99 at launch, while an exclusive digital edition called the <strong>Frightmare Edition</strong> will come in at £39.99/€49.99. This comes with the game itself along with "five in-game wearable masks, five slingshot skins with special trail VFX, a Concept Art Viewer, and a 3D Model Viewer featuring in-game characters, monsters and more".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The debut trailer doesn't look <em>terrible</em> (though it doesn't look amazing, either), but then we clocked who's actually publishing this thing: GameMill Entertainment. You know, the team behind travesties such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/skull_island_rise_of_kong">Skull Island: Rise of Kong</a>. It's not a team known for its high quality, let's put it that way.</p>
<p>Still, we'll reserve judgement for now. Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- SURVIVE AN ORIGINAL GOOSEBUMPS STORY</strong> – Experience a brand-new Goosebumps mystery, crafted exclusively for the game. Encounter fresh terrors inspired by the book series while uncovering the supernatural secrets hidden within Little Creek.</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPLORE THE HORRIFYING UNKNOWN</strong> – Traverse fog-filled streets, creep around abandoned theaters, and sneak through dark libraries teeming with mystery. Every shadow hides a new spooky surprise waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>- <strong>FACE MYSTERIOUS CHALLENGES</strong> – Test your wits with mind-bending puzzles, interactive contraptions, and clever riddles that stand between you and the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>- <strong>STAY AHEAD OF DANGER</strong> – Use stealth and cunning to evade a dreadful menagerie of monsters inspired by classic Goosebumps frights, reimagined for an all-new monster-filled experience. Or fight back with your trusty slingshot!</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE ENDINGS</strong> – Your choices shape the fate of Sloane and her friends. Can you unearth the full truth behind Little Creek’s horrors, or will the town’s mysteries consume you?</p>
