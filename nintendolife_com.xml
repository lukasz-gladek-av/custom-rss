<figure><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6751a32c7063/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released a bunch of free Switch updates alongside the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this month but one issue that wasn't entirely resolved was tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo was only able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">"partially" alleviate an issue</a> which occured when playing the game on the Switch 2, and the "entire screen" would flicker in several scenes. It mentioned in the previous patch notes how a fix was on the way, and today it's seemingly delivered on this promise with the Version 1.1.3 game update:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 3 Deluxe: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released June 16, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurs when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 where the entire screen will briefly turn off and on again in several scenes of the game, such as at the beginning and end of a day.</li>
<li>Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how this particular problem has <em>not</em> been resolved in the Pikmin 3 Deluxe Demo, but a fix for this will be distributed alongside a full game update at some point in the future.</p>
<p>These are the only updates Pikmin 3 Deluxe has received for the Switch 2 so far and if there are any upgrades released, we'll let you know. Pikmin 3 is marked on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility list of games</a> with issues that have "been resolved, or are planned to be resolved by an update".</p>
<p>This follows on from an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9207bed9c7d34/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system firmware update today for the Switch 2 and original model which bumps the hybrid family of devices up to Version 20.1.5.</p>
<p>This update officially kicks off the Switch 2's life with a stability update, but nothing else is revealed in these patch notes. This follows on from Version 20.1.1 which was released earlier this month and contained some minor fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of the latest system update, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3><a id="current" name="current">Ver. 20.1.5 (Released June 18, 2025)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> suggests trying out any games that may have had issues to see how they're performing on this new firmware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm currently seeing reports that 20.1.5 fixes some Switch 1 games that previously didn't work on the Switch 2. If you have any problematic games, try them after updating!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>If you're not prompted to update your system, you can manually enter the system settings from the home menu on the Switch and Switch 2 to perform this update. You then navigate to the "system" option and perform a "system update" from here.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also been updating many of its games over the past week, including its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<p>This included the official reveal of Pauline, the return of many of Donkey Kong's old friends and additional features such as amiibo support and Game Share. Along with this, it looks like the gameplay will offer plenty of variety beyond destruction – with transformations, big boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>So, now that we've had some time to take it all in, we're wondering if the community is sold on this new Donkey Kong game yet, or still needs some more time to decide. Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p>

<p>Once again, Donkey Kong Bananza will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. The Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo figure is also due out on the same date.</p>

The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy — the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>
