<p>It's available at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart Stores in the US. And in Canada, you can take to the court at Best Buy and Walmart.</p>
<p>Nintendo's in-store Switch 2 kiosks have also offered demos for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this latest first-party demo being made available on the eShop (<em>at least yet</em>), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although we didn't share a full preview of this title, Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds recently went hands on with the new entry, and thinks Mario Tennis fans will be "absolutely thrilled" with the new title. We've also done a previews round up if you would like to find out more about this new game.</p>

<p>In some related news, earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would be <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/serve-up-fun-mario-tennis-fever-feb-12-nintendo-san-francisco/">hosting special launch events</a> for Mario Tennis Fever at its stores in New York and San Francisco. These events will feature the game demo, photo ops, a gift alongside the purchase of the title and more.</p>

<p>Here's what's on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a41c3ac65d5b9"><a title="Console Archives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a41c3ac65d5b9/console-archives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hamster Corporation</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's Partner Direct was loaded with all sorts of surprises, and one of the biggest announcements for retro fans was Hamster Corporation's reveal of its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives series</a> for Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/the-arcade-only-rave-racer-drifts-onto-ps5-this-month-console-archives-also-coming-soon">and PlayStation 5</a>).</p>
<p>This will revive classic games, originally released on home consoles, on modern hardware. Two titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> are already available on the Switch 2 eShop, so what else is on the way?</p>
<p>Hamster has now provided details about what else is on the way in its <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIlTJyYR30">latest Japanese broadcast</a>. It features many of the games showcased in the initial announcement. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-doraemon">Doraemon</a> by Hudson has been dated for July, but the rest of these games don't have a release date just yet.</p>
<p>For now, here's what's on the way in the near future (via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong> (Tecmo 8-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> (UEP Systems, 32-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Doraemon</strong> (Hudson, 8-bit) – <strong>30th July 2026</strong><br>
- <strong>Nobunaga’s Ambition</strong> (KOEI, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>MagMax</strong> (Nichibutsu, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong> (Video System, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Dezaemon Plus</strong> (Atena, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</strong> (Nippon Ichi Software, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</strong> (Toshiba-EMI, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Monster Rancher Hop A Bout</strong> (Tecmo, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>UFO: A day in the life</strong> (ASCII, 32-bit)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the Arcade Archives series, Hamster's Console Archives series is "packed with convenient features". This includes customisable button layouts and screen settings, as well as the ability to save and load at any point.</p>
<p>Apart from its reveal of Console Archives, Hamster also announced it would be adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> to its Arcade Archives collection on 26th February 2026.</p>

<p>The demo went live on Switch 2 this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has finally released its demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2 and some side-by-side comparisons to the other versions of the game have now been shared online.</p>
<p>If you are wondering this version holds up, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/64-XoEHbp-o">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, the Switch 2 will run at a lower resolution than the Xbox Series S version, but upscaling is supposedly better on Nintendo's console. This is also said to apply to the Switch 2's filtering and shadow quality, which shows "better results".</p>
<p>As for the game's frame rate, all consoles target 60fps, but the Switch 2 release apparently struggles to maintain this frame rate during more heated moments.</p>

<p>Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">recently previewed Pragmata</a> and had the following things to say about the game's performance and resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you tried out the Pragmata demo on the Switch 2 yet? What are your thoughts so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <guid>1428577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1b90ae549be74"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Key Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b90ae549be74/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-key-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Oh no, not again..." I say as I boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, "Am I about to play through this game for a third time?"</p>
<p>I didn't really need much to entice me back into the world of Hallownest, but after downloading the free upgrade within hours of it releasing, I somehow lost three hours of my life going through Godhome, dabbling in some Pantheons, and getting my backside handed to me by Pure Vessel and Absolute Radiance.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've picked up Team Cherry's game since I beat the sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, and I was surprised at how quickly I slipped back into The Knight's very-different skillset. His steadier movement and smaller build is more deliberate and requires a different mindset than Hornet does, but it turns out, I haven't lost those skills I developed way back when I first played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>That meant I could focus on everything this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is bringing to the table and while it isn't a huge upgrade, you can't complain — this is free, after all (if you already own the Switch 1 game, at least. But the full game is also very cheap).</p>
<figure data-uuid="516aabdad17b9"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/516aabdad17b9/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upgrade focuses entirely on the look and performance of the Metroidvania: now, on Switch 2, you can play Hollow Knight at 4K resolution (docked) and 120fps, if your TV supports it. Handheld, the resolution has been bumped to 1080p, <em>and</em> that 120fps is also an option. You can toggle the frame rate in the in-game options.</p>
<p>To most, 120fps isn't going to be noticeable, but like when I played Silksong on Switch 2, I <em>felt</em> a difference in my gameplay almost immediately. I was missing enemy swipes by mere pixels and perfectly timing pogos and nail slashes at the perfect distance more frequently. The Knight felt snappier, despite being a lot slower than Hornet.</p>
<p>That feeling was universal across both docked and handheld for me; whether I was exploring the glowing confines of Crystal Peak or soaking up the rain in City of Tears or expertly dodging attacks from the Sisters of Battle, it reminded me of what a <em>joy</em> Hollow Knight is to play, even in the wake of its improved sequel.</p>

<p>But part of that might also come from a lack of input delay, something which fans complained about in the original Switch release. I shared some brief thoughts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a>, but it's something I genuinely never noticed until I started playing on Switch 2, and tackled the same few bosses on both consoles. I was noticeably better and more-reactive on the newer console; even when I was dying, I was consistently closer to beating the boss each time on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The star of the upgrade, however, is the improved visuals. Beyond simply bumping the resolution, which makes the game look much-more crisp, Team Cherry has also added "additional effects", which is a modest way of saying improved the lighting, the level of colour (particularly the shades of black and grey), and highlighted more details in the backdrops.</p>
<p>Now Crystal Peak's gems glimmer with an even more vibrant purple, contrasting even stronger with the dim lamps and the darker areas of the map. Greenpath's lush, verdant foliage feels more alive with deeper greens and shinier thorns. Even the Crossroads' dim, grey hallways appear more detailed, and when it's eventually overrun with infection, the orange puss glow feels like it's bursting out of the screen.</p>
<figure data-uuid="702d02162f453"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d02162f453/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hollow Knight was already a pretty game, but now it's much more in-line with the colour and lighting of Silksong. There are so many little things in the upgrade that give Hallownest a new glow to it; it actually has me itching to replay the whole thing again, perhaps even for a Steel Soul run.</p>
<p>The thing is, for most — especially on a first-time playthrough — you're probably not going to notice much of a difference, because many of the upgrades are small. The game was already 60fps on Switch, just with a blurrier resolution in handheld, and the jump to 120fps isn't as easy to notice as it is from 30 to 60. And the input delay is only really noticeable if you've played the game on other platforms or if you're a speedrunner.</p>
<p>So yes, Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition might not be a transformative upgrade, but it is <em>free</em>, and if you're paying attention, you'll notice and love all of the little tweaks and improvements. Honestly, the handheld visuals alone make this more than enough for me to recommend Switch 2 as the place to play the game now. Perhaps this is the platform where I will finally make the time to conquer the Pantheon of Hallownest...</p>
