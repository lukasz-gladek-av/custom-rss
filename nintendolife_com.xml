<p>4K puzzling awaits</p>

<figure data-uuid="c1f0558e8cf02"><a title="Braid: Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1f0558e8cf02/braid-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Thekla</em></figcaption></figure><p>If, on a random Wednesday afternoon, you were considering picking up or replaying Braid on your Switch,then we've got good news for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/braid_anniversary_edition">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> has received a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and it's out today.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/braid-anniversary-edition-just-got-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Everything</a>, at the time of writing, the game is available on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000117066">the Japanese eShop</a>, with other territories surely following suit very soon. It costs 3,169 yen for the game, or 475 yen to upgrade, so expect to pay a little extra for the Switch 2 magic when it hits the eShop in your region.</p>
<p>So, what does the Switch 2 Edition bring to Braid? 120fps gameplay (if your TV supports it), even more developer commentary, and 1080p handheld and 4K docked resolution. Very nice.</p>
<p>If you've never played Braid before, the critically-acclaimed puzzler came to Switch back in 2024 as an enhanced rerelease of the 2008 indie classic. The Anniversary Edition features lovely painted pixel art, additional challenges, and developer commentary.</p>
<p>The game's creator, Jonathan Blow, spoke about the rerelease's sales just a few months after it launched, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/braid-anniversary-edition-sales-have-been-utterly-terrible-says-creator">calling them "utterly terrible"</a>. Perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will give the numbers a boost.</p>
<p>His next game, <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>, is coming to PC sometime in 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b5afdef867a31"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5afdef867a31/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a strange little concept. It's a life sim set in the Pokémon world where you, a humanoid Ditto, set out to rebuild a fallen civilisation with the help of your pocket monster pals. Weird, right? Where could the inspiration for that possibly have stemmed from? <em>Uhhh</em>, the GBA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>, it seems.</p>
<p>Game Freak's Shigeru Ohmori sat down with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/pokemon-pokopia/">VGC</a> at a recent Pokopia preview event in Tokyo and spilled the beans about how the project started. “When I was working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, I was continuously looking for new possibilities for Pokémon,” he said. “It brought me back to when I started on Ruby and Sapphire, creating those habitats and meeting the Pokémon for the first time. That led me to create the prototype for this game.”</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjgosqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Ohmori's first work on the series came in the early 2000s, when he was tasked with designing maps for the flagship Gen III titles. "When I was creating the map, which was 2D at the time, I was putting grass onto it where Pokémon would appear,” he told VGC, “that feeling of Pokémon appearing when I was creating the habitat was very interesting to me, and that feeling is something I cherish.”</p>
<p>You can see how such a feeling went on to inform Pokopia. This is, on a basic level, a game all about making habitats and watching Pokémon rock up to make the most of them. Later in the VGC discussion, Ohmori brought up Ruby and Sapphire's Secret Base building as a personal favourite non-battling series mechanic: "I would like to scale the Pokémon games in general, aside from battling. I will seek new possibilities to scale them.” It's a game inspired by the joys of that early game development — how sweet is that!</p>
<p>"Anything that the Pokémon does was carefully curated on the lore that already existed," game director Takuto Edagawa said in the same interview, "to ensure we didn’t break any of the past Pokémon canon.” It's the reason why we've seen Ditto dropping a punch bag to attract a Hitmonchan or a fishing rod to attract a Magikarp in the Pokopia trailers, so it might be worth getting clued up on your favourite Pokémon's likes/dislikes before diving in next month.</p>
<p>And it sounds like you'll want to dive in as soon as possible, if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear">our early preview</a> is anything to go by. "It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon," our Ollie Reynolds wrote, claiming that this could be the perfect antidote to the jaded Pokémon fan.</p>
<p>Pokémon Pokopia arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>.</p>

<p>Or maybe FireRed and LeafGreen?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ac61c31bd8847"><a title="Pokemon Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac61c31bd8847/pokemon-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations underway, fans are quite rightly curious about how Nintendo and The Pokémon Company might acknowledge the games that started it all.</p>
<p>Yes, without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a> (and Green), there would be no Pokémon and no 30th anniversary celebrations. Almost 10 years ago for the 20th anniversary, classic Pokémon games were added to the 3DS eShop on 27th February 2016. Users could buy these à la carte, long before Nintendo started to lean on subscription models for its retro games, and it made for an appropriate way to acknowledge the important milestone.</p>
<p>A new, unsubstantiated rumour from known Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331">Riddler_Khu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-may-be-returning-on-switch-2-for-30th-anniversary/">Vice Gaming</a>) suggests that Nintendo might be gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> on the Switch for the 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether these might be available via Nintendo Switch online or as standalone purchases (or, indeed, whether it's even a remotely credible claim at all), but it would make for a substantial addition to the GBA catalogue. Certainly, it would convince many Switch Online subscribers to upgrade to the more expensive Expansion Pack tier.</p>
<p>Whether this claim from Riddler_Khu is credible or not (and history suggests that their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/rofbyn/is_khu_even_trustworthy_anymore/">trustworthiness is sketchy at best</a> these days), it's nevertheless inspired us to speculate on whether classic Pokémon games will make a return for the 30th anniversary. And if they will, in what form should they take?</p>
<p>So, let us know what you think, dear readers, by voting in the below polls and leaving a comment in the usual place.</p>
