<p>Both versions!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo followed up on its recently 'Close to You' short with another version that confirmed the presence of <strong>Pikmin</strong>, the company annoyingly kept it locked to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore, because both versions of the film – Pikmin and invisible Pikmin – have been uploaded to YouTube in one 8-minute-long video. Nice!</p>
<p>In case you happened to miss the whole thing, Close to You was uploaded with no warning and depicted a young child happily playing about with objects that seemed to be moving on their own. With some familiar background music, however, many had deduced that this simply <em>must</em> be Pikmin-related in some way.</p>
<p>Turns out it was! The video was uploaded to Nintendo Today!, but updated to show that the moving objects were actually being manipulated by lots and lots of Pikmin.</p>
<p>Many (including us) had hoped that this might be some indication of something more from the Pikmin franchise, but it was subsequently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sorry-nintendos-recent-pikmin-videos-arent-hinting-at-something-more">confirmed to be the first project from Nintendo Pictures</a>, the video production team previously known as Dynamo Pictures. The same company had also produced several Pikmin shorts back in the mid 2010s.</p>
<p>Having said that, Nintendo has just recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> will be receiving a free content update on Switch, adding in new Pikmin designs, a photo mode, and more. Pretty cool, huh? So we guess it wasn't all for show then.</p>

<p>Decor Pikmin! Photo Mode!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Well, we weren't expecting this!</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is receiving a free update next month, adding in adorably unique 'Decor Pikmin' for your squad, a photo mode, and new modes adjusting the overall aggression of in-game creatures.</p>
<p>There's no firm release date just yet, but Nintendo has also confirmed that an updated demo will also be released on the same day.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Decor Pikmin</strong>: Originally seen in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.pikminbloom.com%252F%26esheet%3D54343309%26newsitemid%3D20251022648787%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DPikmin%2BBloom%26index%3D4%26md5%3D74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1761225063211000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yLvAAUb9qdTg_c-UvNF35" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pikminbloom.com%2F&amp;esheet=54343309&amp;newsitemid=20251022648787&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Pikmin+Bloom&amp;index=4&amp;md5=74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><em>Pikmin Bloom</em></a><sup>1</sup> smart-device app, these curious Pikmin are marching their way to <em>Pikmin 4</em>. Decor Pikmin (like the name implies) are Pikmin that don some form of decoration found in the world – you may see them wearing something like a wind-up toy, a doughnut, a snow hat and much more. Decor Pikmin you gather in the new <em>Pikmin 4</em> update can also be transferred to your squad in <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, including some that are completely new!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Field Camera</strong>: Take stylish photos of your character, your squad and whatever you like with this new feature. Set the scene with various angles, hide characters, and decorate your pics with filters, frames and stamps. The camera may even be the key to adding Decor Pikmin to your crew …</p>
<p><strong>- New Creature Activity Levels</strong>: Move at your own pace and enjoy the new Relaxed mode, where creatures won’t attack unless you attack them, or kick things up a notch in the fiery Fierce mode. These modes can be selected when starting a new game or changed at any point after from the game’s settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also been announced that Pikmin Bloom will receive a new update to add in Ice Pikmin, marking the variant's first ever appearance in the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMlv5rEu2I">A new trailer</a> has also been uploaded to mark this announcment.</p>
<p>We wondered if perhaps the recent 'Close to You' Pikmin videos would perhaps lead to something more, and it sure did! Okay, it's not quite the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' we'd love to see, but hey, we'll take it.</p>

<p>Hello Games is back with yet another update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a>, and this one feels suitably spooky — 'tis the season, after all.</p>
<p>The big addition in today's 'Breach' update is a series of space wrecks that pop up across the universe, all of which are fully explorable. Using the newly added space walking abilities, you'll be able to dive into these wrecks and salvage parts for your ship, which, let's not forget, can now be customised thanks to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-lets-you-design-and-build-your-own-spaceship">'Voyagers' update</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a new expedition launching alongside this update, which will have you playing space Sherlock to work out what happened to a mysterious wreck. This mission will lead you to the edge of space, to rare purple-star solar systems, to... more ship parts, probably.</p>
<p>For a taster of what you can expect, here are some screenshots from Hello Games:</p>

<p>It sounds like another solid addition to an already jam-packed game, and a prime jumping-in point for those who haven't checked out the Switch 2 version yet — which we described as "an almost perfect port of an almighty behemoth of a game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lumo-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-lumo-2-switch-a-delightful-celebration-of-british-retro-gaming.1331404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Sitting down to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumo_2">Lumo 2</a>, as a gamer of a certain vintage, I fully expected to be treated to a few touching moments as developer Triple Eh? transported me back to the sweet innocence (and unbelievable stupidity) of my gaming childhood. A few nostalgia button pushes and I'd be happy enough. Sit that alongside some decent gameplay, and we could be onto a winner.</p>
<p>Just as was the case in 2016's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lumo">Lumo</a>, the point here is to give you short bursts of action-styles from classic adventures resurrected from the depths of computer game history. You know the sorts of things; in the first Lumo you had stuff like <strong>Knight Lore</strong>, <strong>Equinox</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/head_over_heels">Head Over Heels</a>, whilst this sequel serves up...well...to list them all would be spoiling things, but let's just saying kicking off your game with a delightfully spot-on homage to Dennis Caswell's 1984 classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/c64/impossible_mission">Impossible Mission</a>, is one way to get me fully onboard <em>very</em> quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as I started tumbling (awkwardly slowly) over robotic enemies and waiting impatiently for trundling lifts to move up and down, I knew I was in dream town. And I'm not even being sarcastic. This plays exactly how I remember the game it's aping, and whilst Lumo 2 does have some presentation issues on Switch - it's a little blurry at times - the selection of game tributes it presents, as your huge-hatted protagonist bounds through and snaps up a series of satisfyingly tricky collectibles, are all on-point mechanically. Hooray!</p>
<p>Depending on who you are, though, it may be sort of a half-hooray. The homages are <em>so</em> on-point that they're going to alienate some by their very nature. They're tough, and this isometric malarkey is no joke — believe me, I fought in the original Isometric Wars. Lumo 2, just as was the case with the first, sticks to all the retro trappings. Your avatar is slow and cumbersome; that's intentional. Deaths come thick and fast, sometimes because of the camera angle being tricky to judge at points; that's also meant to be the case.</p>
<p>I think it's great, but you see the potential issue! It's not a game for everyone, by any means. You'll also be losing out by not getting all the references, cameos, little nods and jokes along the way as you play through a generous helping of around 100 retro-inspired levels.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you love a bit of the rough and tumble of proper old-school isometric stuff; stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> or <strong>Ant Attack</strong>, whilst also getting blasted with the occasional side-scrolling/3D surprise, and with plenty of tricky rubber duckie collectibles and in-game achievements to tick off as you go, I'd say Lumo 2 is a return that gives us more of the very-satisfying same. Oh, and you can play it Welsh, so bonus points all round!</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lumo 2, just like its predecessor, does a great job of reintroducing players to a whole bunch of retro delights from the 1980s, and in small enough servings that they don't outstay their welcome. There's an impressive array of tricky isometric levels to get stuck into besting here, plenty of collectibles and achievements to tick off, some nice side-scrolling surprises along the way, and a general retro-british vibe that you can't help but love infusing the entire thing. Whilst it may not meaningfully evolve its predecessor, Lumo 2 is yet more of the good stuff.</p></section>
