            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Publisher Kitfox Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> will finally release on the Nintendo Switch this month on <strong>16th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The title has been a long time coming – 17 years in the making, to be precise – so the recent delays on Switch have felt pretty trivial, thankfully. Toward the end of January, Kitfox stated that the release would likely slip into February as it was awaiting final approval. That's now seemingly happened, and everything is a-go for the 16th.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Caves of Qud is a roguelike RPG developed by Freehold Games. It's received critical acclaim on other platforms for its deep systems, emergent gameplay, and freedom of choice. We're really excited to dive into this one when it launches next month, but if you need a bit more of an overview, here's the official breakdown of key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Deep Physical Simulation</strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.<br>
<strong><br>
- Fully Simulated Creatures</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.<br>
<strong><br>
- Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.<br>
<strong><br>
- Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.<br>
<strong><br>
- Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.<br>
<strong><br>
- RPG Elements</strong> – Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.<br>
<strong><br>
- Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</p>

<p>A hollow promise?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3f39f5339d751"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f39f5339d751/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-coming-2026-hollow-knight-switch-2-edition-also-announced">we learned</a> that the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> would be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of its own at some point in 2026. In true Team Cherry style, things have been radio silent ever since, but a newly-emerged PEGI rating may suggest that we're closer to release than we had initially expected (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">official PEGI website</a>, Switch 2 has been added to the Hollow Knight platform list, under the original game's '7' age rating. The rating cites "mild violence to fantasy characters and pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children" as the reason for this classification, none of which is all that surprising if you've ever set foot in Deepnest *<em>shudders</em>*.</p>
<p>The other thing worth pointing out is that the Switch 2 version is accompanied by a release date of 5th February 2026. Tha- that's today!</p>
<figure data-uuid="0007ea4604dc3"><a title="Hollow Knight PEGI Rating" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0007ea4604dc3/hollow-knight-pegi-rating.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight">PEGI</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, this <em>might</em> be nothing, and we actually have months to go before we get to dive into Hallownest again. PEGI ratings have a habit of cropping up out of the blue with a 'release date' that seems to correspond to the date that the rating was added rather than the date the game was released — see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hi-fi-rush-has-been-rated-for-the-switch-again">15th January Switch date</a> from last month.</p>
<p>But we can't help but notice that there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-today-5th-february-2026">Partner Direct</a> today, and we suppose a shadow drop for this kind of thing <em>could</em> be on the cards.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what the showcase brings. For reference, Team Cherry has confirmed that Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will boast "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects", and it'll be available as a free upgrade to all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we also have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Sea of Sorrow</a>' expansion to look forward to at some point this year. While Team Cherry said it was keeping "further details a secret for now" at its reveal back in December, it teased new areas, bosses, tools and more.</p>
