<p>The timing...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a> made its debut on the Switch earlier this year, and if you've been hanging out for a Switch 2 Edition, it seems you might be in luck.</p>
<p>A new classification for <strong>Hello Kitty Island Adventure - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> has recently been spotted on the Entertainment Software Rating Board. It's received 'E' for 'Everyone' and includes the attached rating summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hello Kitting Island Adventure Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB. Also includes Users Interact. This is an adventure in which players help Hello Kitty and friends restore a mysterious island. Players explore the island, interact with friends, complete quests, and engage in various activities (e.g. cooking, fishing, gardening)."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we mentioned in our review how this cute social sim shares a lot of similarities with Nintendo's game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, it also draws inspiration from other series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>. You can find out more about this in our review. Hello Kitty's island adventure also got some DLC in September, adding a whole new map, new residents, recipes, minigames and much more.</p>
<p>If we get an official update about Hello Kitty Island Adventure coming to the Switch 2 in the future, we'll let you know.</p>
