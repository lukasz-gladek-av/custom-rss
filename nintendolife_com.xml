<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3e3334b44c74/donkey-konga-2-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mmm, bananas. <em>Ahem</em>, sorry about that. We meant to say, welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we swing over to this week's bongo brawlers, let's quickly recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-jet-set-radio-dreamcast">last time</a> when three covers from the Dreamcast's <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> went head to head (to head). There was a decent spread of votes, but the funky Japanese design ultimately walked away with 46% of the split and the win. North America followed behind with 30%, and Europe took home the remaining slice — <em>funky</em>.</p>
<p>After the week we've had in Nintendo Land, there was only one direction we could head in this time. With DK on the brain, we're turning to the prized primate's beloved bongo-bashing sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> ('Hit Song Parade', in Japan), for another three-way vote.</p><p><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0trnihg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You don't need us to provide a recap of this one. The series still slaps, it's been too long, trilogy remaster when? etc. Keep to the beat as we meet our three competitors below.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:159632,184111 @ 1750586405 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c0914233e26c/donkey-konga-2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Woah, DK! You're hitting the bongo so hard, your legs have swung into the air! That's too much bongo, DK!</p>
<p>The central pose is fitting, really, when you consider just how hard this cover slaps. The red and white background, the cel-shaded DK, that rock-and-roll spray-painted '2' in the logo. Just makes you want to whip out the peripherals and go for a bongo sesh, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b44c041163d/donkey-konga-2-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design is a little tamer, by comparison, but it does have added Diddy Kong, which is always a bonus. The bright green background subtly packs in some musical notes (a nice touch), and we're fans of the DK and Diddy sprites that appear in the logo — did we really need the other ones down the bottom, though?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78f5519329731/donkey-konga-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, now that's more like it! The logo from the European design returns here, but it takes centre stage on its own. With the focus on DK and Diddy, and the bonus balloons and confetti that are scattered around them, this one really sells the 'party' vibes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-donkey-konga-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "gnarly remake" adds multiple new parks</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> revives two more classics next month, but that's not all! In case you missed it, it's also adding a new pinball-themed park to the series featuring the Birdman himself.</p>
<p>This is one of multiple new parks "joining the lineup of original parks" in this upcoming title, due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>11th July 2025</strong>. To build up the excitement, Activision and Iron Galaxy have now released a new trailer showcasing this park in motion. Here's what you can expect along with some of the inspiration behind this design:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pinball drops players into a pinball game featuring the tombstones of fallen skaters around a playfield filled with ramps, rails, and flippers at the control of Tony Hawk. Watch out for silver balls running down the board and track your best combo on the backbox display.</p>
<p>"Developer Iron Galaxy Studios shares a special connection to pinball, many of its early members incorporating their knowledge acquired while working for Midway Games in Chicago, a prominent name in arcade and pinball gaming. This homage offers the perfect mix honoring their roots while flexing their creative skills in a wild new park design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can expect all sorts of wild segments throughout this park including "the eyeball", "brains", and even a river filled with "hungry alligators". Apart from this pinball park, some other new parks include Movie Studio and Waterpark.</p>
<p>Here are some additional screenshots and you can even get some "pro tips" about what to be on the lookout for in this park over on the official <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-park-map-guide-pinball">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 blog</a>.

<p>SpongeBob and friends join the race</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-sonic-racing-crossworlds-character-leaks-reportedly-surface">character leaks earlier this month</a>, Sega has now officially confirmed SpongeBob SquarePants and other Nickelodeon characters will be racing alongside Sonic and friends in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> when it arrives this September.</p>
<p>This news was shared during the 2025 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. SpongeBob (and Patrick Star) will be part of the game's season pass and will be joined by characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Avatar universe. This extends to themed vehicles and tracks.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>While Japanese video game consultancy firm Kyos Inc insists that publishers are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">"thanking Nintendo"</a> for the move following rising production costs of physical media, others are less keen on them; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">almost 70% of you said you wouldn't be buying Game-Key Card releases</a>, and many companies within the industry have said they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nightdive-studios-ceo-says-that-game-key-cards-on-switch-2-is-disheartening">dislike the approach.</a></p>
<p>Game-Key Cards are Nintendo's attempt to bridge the gap between 'code in a box' releases and traditional game cards, where the game data is included on the card itself. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">Many have warned that this system is anti-consumer</a>; when Nintendo turns off the servers in a few years, the cards become useless.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">who has already spoken to us about the subject</a>, has taken to social media to issue a rallying call to developers—people don't want Game-Key Card releases, so, if your studio is looking to produce a physical Switch 2 release, they should get in touch with the boutique publisher:</p>

<p>While Game-Key Cards have been rejected by many consumers, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">recent leak</a> gives a pretty solid reason why so many companies are embracing them; if you want to publish your game physically on Switch 2, you have to pay Nintendo for 64GB card—there are no smaller options this time around, unfortunately, as was the case with Switch 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo itself has said it will not be using Game-Key Cards for any of its first-party games.</a></p>
