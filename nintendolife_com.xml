<figure data-uuid="5a6ceee95033b"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a6ceee95033b/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like other iconic Nintendo series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> has a timeline documenting Samus' space adventures from past to present. Although the newest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very much its own thing, it is still part of the Prime series as a new chapter.</p>
<p>Outside of the first-person entries, it's now apparently been mentioned by Nintendo how this game fits within the <em>entire</em> history of the Metroid series. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211">Speaking to Famitsu</a> recently, Nintendo's development team reportedly told the famous Japanese gaming outlet how the latest Switch and Switch 2 outing is set <em>after</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> on the Super Nintendo and <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> on the Game Boy Advance (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-timeline-placement/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cevwgrph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In saying this, it's reiterated how the new entry takes place in "another dimension", meaning there is no need to worry about the timeline or possible impacts on the 2D Metroid series. As a result, players can jump into this new adventure without any prior knowledge and enjoy the original setting. It has been an 18-year wait between this game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Corruption</a>, after all.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review of Metroid Prime 4 here on Nintendo Life</a>, we also mentioned how newcomers would be able to enjoy this new adventure without having to understand the history of the series. If Nintendo, Retro Studios or a prominent Nintendo figure says anything else about how exactly Beyond fits within the Metroid timeline, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Arc System Works finally delivered the long-awaited Switch update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, in a new development update, it has addressed the future of this particular version of the game. It mentions how the Switch version has required "a great deal of effort and ingenuity" and as a result, the team is currently examining what exact form future updates "beyond Version 2.0" could take.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this is dependent on how far the development team can push itself, and if it's able to overcome technical challenges. Here's the message in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytmyrpG5TN7_Q" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808mntqsx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Regarding the future of GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Developing and operating the game on Nintendo Switch required a great deal of effort and ingenuity to work within hardware constraints.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we are currently examining what form future updates beyond Version 2.0 could take for the Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Please note that feasibility will depend not only on technical challenges, but also on how far we can push ourselves as a development team, as well as on feedback and support from our players. All of these factors will be taken into account as we make our decisions."</p>

<p>Is Capcom up to something?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="6c488450c3e97"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c488450c3e97/monster-hunter-wilds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom’s <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series has sold incredibly well on Nintendo hardware over the years and while there have been no official updates about the mainline series returning to Switch hardware anytime soon, something rather interesting has apparently been discovered in a new <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> datamine.</p>
<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>. Capcom hasn’t said anything about bringing this new entry to Nintendo platforms, but it has already shown strong support for Nintendo’s new hybrid system with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7gqxrjk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>
