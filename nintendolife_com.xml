<p>HGiG or not HGiG, that is the question</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've been feeling (as this writer has) that your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> graphics look a little washed out on your TV set in docked mode, guess what? It seems a bunch of other folk have too. What's more, there's an actual reason for it, and it can be fixed. Sort of. Hooray!</p>
<p>The video above from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hdtvtest">YouTuber HDTVTest</a> addresses the issue we've encountered on an LG OLED TV set. We've had a little fiddle this morning (careful now) and we can confirm that our Switch 2 is looking much better, much richer, and more vibrant on our OLED TVs thanks to the tips in this useful breakdown of what's up with the console's HDR.</p>
<p>So, what <em>is</em> up with it? In short, there are a bunch of problems outlined here, all revolving around a setting know as HGiG (HDR Gaming Interest Group), that deals with tone mapping whilst playing games.</p>
<p>When in your HDR adjustment settings in docked mode on Switch 2, you're presented with a test pattern of two suns. Adjusting these so the one on the right disappears gives you the best HDR setting. Simple.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 HRD Fix vid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79b592b711e16/switch-2-hrd-fix-vid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>However! TV sets <em>without HGiG</em> have an issue. With the setting turned on, the test performs as it should, but turned off it makes the test perform incorrectly, so you max out <em>way</em> above the recommended nits whilst attempting to calibrate HDR. Hence, the washed-out image quality.</p>
<p>The video mentions that there are also a huge number of increments to the adjustments with Nintendo's HDR configuration (you can click a whole lot of times with very little difference to the image), which makes the process feel more granular and ineffective. They compare this functionality to Xbox and PlayStation, which have fewer steps to toggle through on their HDR setting screen, and are therefore more readable and easier to adjust.</p>
<p>HDTVTest also discusses Switch 2's "suboptimal default paper white settings," which the video says are off out of the box and tied into HDR settings in a strange way. There's a <em>very detailed</em> breakdown of all of this in the vid so do make sure to check it all out, it's well worth the 10 minutes it takes.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdd782dba12d3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're anything like us, then chances are you've been handling your Switch 2 like it's a ticking timebomb. There's nothing quite as soul-crushing as when a new piece of tech gets a nasty dent on the casing or a horrible scratch on the screen. It feels like the end of the world.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, reports are starting to emerge that the screen is proving to be particularly susceptible to scratches, with a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spintherism/">Spintherism</a> gathering plenty of comments from users stating that their own consoles are becoming all scratched up.</p>
<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueBrawler2001/">TheTrueBrawler2001</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yep, my Switch 2 got scratched from the dock. I've confirmed with my retailer that I can trade it in for a new one once they receive more inventory, but I'm out of luck until then. Already purchased a screen protector in anticipation. If I get a new Switch 2 before it arrives, then I'm not even opening the Switch 2 box until then so I can put it on immediately and protect the new screen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even our own lovely video producer Felix has confirmed that his Switch 2 has received a fair few light scratches since launch. The general consensus seems to be that, like the Switch OLED before it, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2s-screen-comes-with-a-pre-applied-film-layer-dont-peel-it-off">actually the protective plastic film getting all scratched up</a>, not the screen itself.</p>
<p>That would be fine – reassuring, even – but Nintendo has explicitly stated that users should not remove the protective film in order to prevent shards of glass flying about in the event of a severe breakage. So with that in mind, yes, the screen is effectively getting all scratched up, even though it <em>technically</em> isn't.</p>
<p>Touch wood, this writer hasn't experienced anything of the sort yet (<em>though I do also have an extra screen protector applied, just in case</em>), but we'd now like to hand it over to you. Has your Switch 2's screen gathered any nasty scratches yet?</p>
