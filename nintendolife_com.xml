And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkuomqy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>

<p>4K puzzling awaits</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c1f0558e8cf02"><a title="Braid: Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1f0558e8cf02/braid-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Thekla</em></figcaption></figure><p>If, on a random Wednesday afternoon, you were considering picking up or replaying Braid on your Switch,then we've got good news for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/braid_anniversary_edition">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> has received a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and it's out today.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/braid-anniversary-edition-just-got-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Everything</a>, at the time of writing, the game is available on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000117066">the Japanese eShop</a>, with other territories surely following suit very soon. It costs 3,169 yen for the game, or 475 yen to upgrade, so expect to pay a little extra for the Switch 2 magic when it hits the eShop in your region.</p>
<p>So, what does the Switch 2 Edition bring to Braid? 120fps gameplay (if your TV supports it), even more developer commentary, and 1080p handheld and 4K docked resolution. Very nice.</p>
<p>If you've never played Braid before, the critically-acclaimed puzzler came to Switch back in 2024 as an enhanced rerelease of the 2008 indie classic. The Anniversary Edition features lovely painted pixel art, additional challenges, and developer commentary.</p>
<p>The game's creator, Jonathan Blow, spoke about the rerelease's sales just a few months after it launched, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/braid-anniversary-edition-sales-have-been-utterly-terrible-says-creator">calling them "utterly terrible"</a>. Perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will give the numbers a boost.</p>
<p>His next game, <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>, is coming to PC sometime in 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b5afdef867a31"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5afdef867a31/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a strange little concept. It's a life sim set in the Pokémon world where you, a humanoid Ditto, set out to rebuild a fallen civilisation with the help of your pocket monster pals. Weird, right? Where could the inspiration for that possibly have stemmed from? <em>Uhhh</em>, the GBA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>, it seems.</p>
<p>Game Freak's Shigeru Ohmori sat down with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/pokemon-pokopia/">VGC</a> at a recent Pokopia preview event in Tokyo and spilled the beans about how the project started. “When I was working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, I was continuously looking for new possibilities for Pokémon,” he said. “It brought me back to when I started on Ruby and Sapphire, creating those habitats and meeting the Pokémon for the first time. That led me to create the prototype for this game.”</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkuomqy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Ohmori's first work on the series came in the early 2000s, when he was tasked with designing maps for the flagship Gen III titles. "When I was creating the map, which was 2D at the time, I was putting grass onto it where Pokémon would appear,” he told VGC, “that feeling of Pokémon appearing when I was creating the habitat was very interesting to me, and that feeling is something I cherish.”</p>
<p>You can see how such a feeling went on to inform Pokopia. This is, on a basic level, a game all about making habitats and watching Pokémon rock up to make the most of them. Later in the VGC discussion, Ohmori brought up Ruby and Sapphire's Secret Base building as a personal favourite non-battling series mechanic: "I would like to scale the Pokémon games in general, aside from battling. I will seek new possibilities to scale them.” It's a game inspired by the joys of that early game development — how sweet is that!</p>
<p>"Anything that the Pokémon does was carefully curated on the lore that already existed," game director Takuto Edagawa said in the same interview, "to ensure we didn’t break any of the past Pokémon canon.” It's the reason why we've seen Ditto dropping a punch bag to attract a Hitmonchan or a fishing rod to attract a Magikarp in the Pokopia trailers, so it might be worth getting clued up on your favourite Pokémon's likes/dislikes before diving in next month.</p>
<p>And it sounds like you'll want to dive in as soon as possible, if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear">our early preview</a> is anything to go by. "It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon," our Ollie Reynolds wrote, claiming that this could be the perfect antidote to the jaded Pokémon fan.</p>
<p>Pokémon Pokopia arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>.</p>
