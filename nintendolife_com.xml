<p>Another free upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the gift that just keeps on giving — just a few weeks after ConcernedApe announced it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">working on a 1.7 update</a>, today's Nintendo Direct also unveiled a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the beloved farming sim.</p>
<p>And of course, the upgrade is 100% free too. Plus, it includes Mouse Mode controls, which will make decorating your house and farm <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition isn't just about the mouse, though. Four-player split-screen multiplayer and eight-player online multiplayer is also coming.</p>
<p><em>And</em> just in case you still didn't think Stardew was great value, you can now use GameShare to play with up to up to three others if they don't have the game. And yes, it works with Switch 1 and Switch 2. That's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley is already one of the best games on Switch, and it's easily one of the best farm sims of all time. We can't wait to lose our life to this again on Switch 2. It might be time for a new co-op farm...</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to the Switch 2 Edition in the comments</em>.</p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

<p>Plus new starter Megas are coming to the base game</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>it's not even out yet, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is <em>already</em> getting DLC, and it was announced during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension</a> doesn't have a release date yet, but it looks to focus on the Pokémon Hoopa and features two brand new Mega Evolutions for Raichu — Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.</p>
<p>Hoopa is apparently opening up dimensions across Lumiose City. What that means for our intrepid trainer? No idea, but we bet we'll get hoop-ing (sorry) in to find out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Z-A news we got today. Just before that, we got <a href="https://youtu.be/PPTqA10lt-c?si=Wl_17ewBg7a7QQF0">a little peek at three new Mega Evolutions</a>, and they're for the Kalos Starter Trio.</p>
<p>Yep, Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja are all getting their own Mega. <em>Finally</em><em>.</em> You'll need to earn a Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite via the Z-A Battle Club in order to see them, but they're excellent evolutions of their original class-based designs.</p>

<p>We've already seen a brand new Mega Evolution in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-legends-z-a-unveils-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolution">Mega Malamar earlier this week</a>, so with this batch of five newbies, we're swimming in new battle opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of these new Megas in the comments below!</em></p>

<p>We shouldn't be surprised, but oof</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="SMG + SMG2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0c3f17aee1bd/smg-plus-smg2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's store pages are live for the freshly announced, repetitiously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, and <em>woof</em>, if you thought Nintendo was pushing it with $80 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World,</a> maybe go and fetch something to calm your nerves.</p>
<p>In the US, the bundle containing both Wii games — remastered and including extra content and amiibo functionality — will set you back $70, physical or digital. It's listed for £58.99 in the UK, although we've yet to confirm if that applies to physical too.</p>
<p>Both games are available separately (digitally) on the eShop, too, for $39.99 / £33.99 each. All versions launch on <strong>2nd October</strong>.</p>
<p><em>"But they're two of the very best games of all time!"</em> says Nintendo, probably. And absolutely, it's hard to argue with that! They're both 10/10 masterpieces. But blimey. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/video_does_super_mario_galaxy_2_on_wii_u_offer_anything_new">We remember</a> back on Wii U Virtual Console when these were re-released at the discounted price of £8.99 before going up to £17.99.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61242558757c5/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915406.html">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lest we forget, Nintendo isn't just putting out the same old ROMs this time, with significantly more work going into this Galaxy port than last time the game appeared on Switch as part of the limited-time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> compilation (which omitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 2</a>). These games will have some new content included. Also, although they're launching for Switch 1, a free update will bump up the resolution to 4K docked, 1080p handheld on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, though. For people who already own Galaxy on Switch who are looking to complete the set, 34 quid for the sequel is significant, however enhanced it is.</p>
<p><em>Or is it? It is one of the best video games ever made! Let us know your thoughts — and if you'll be picking one or both of the games up — in the comments.</em></p>

<p>In addition to Remake Intergrade in January 2026</p>

<figure><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b23b80c8f7138/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following confirmation that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>, Square Enix has announced that the entire remake trilogy will make its way to Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>So, this includes the aforementioned Remake Intergrade, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the as-yet unconfirmed third entry. There's no release window as of yet, but it's great to finally get official confirmation regardless.</p>

<p>It's also been confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be a Game-Key Card release on the Switch 2, so it's reasonable to assume that the two sequels will also utilise the controversial medium for their respective releases.</p>
