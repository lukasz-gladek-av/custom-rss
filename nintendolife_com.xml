<p>'Mounts of Mayhem' is almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> announced a new drop officially titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-minecraft-live-september-2025-new-drops-mobs-weapons-dlc-and-more">Mounts of Mayhem</a>'. The development team has now confirmed the Bedrock Edition of the game will receive this "final game drop" of the year on <strong>9th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial reveal, this new drop will come loaded with a new weapon (the spear), the Zombie Horse, and the Nautilus (a new mob you can tame, ride and equip with armour). There'll also be a Zombie Nautilus.</p>
<p>Last but not least is the Camel Husk and its two riders - a husk and a parched. The team is also adding some quality-of-life improvements such as the ability to cross bodies of water on horseback. You can get more details about this content drop in the latest monthly video update above and in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-minecraft-live-september-2025-new-drops-mobs-weapons-dlc-and-more">Minecraft Live September 2025 round up</a> post.</p>

<p>More Mega action in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a> in September, mentioning at the time how it would be arriving on the Switch at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update, this new collection featuring multiple titles has now been rated E10+ by the ESRB, with the rating mentioning "Fantasy Violence" and "Users Interact". Here's the official ESRB summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection</em> is rated E10+ for Everyone 10+ by the ESRB with Fantasy Violence. Also includes Users Interact. This is a collection of action role-playing games in which players help characters battle viruses in a futuristic world. Players interact with characters, explore fantasy environments, and use battle cards to perform attacks on enemies in an arena. Battle-card attacks include use of energy blasts, punches, kicks, bombs, ice blasts, and swords. A higher-resolution art gallery depicts other violent acts: robots cut in half or impaled by swords; a character with arrows sticking out of his back."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Protodude, the owner of Mega Man fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/">Rockman Corner</a>, also notes how the "three original releases" all carried 'E' ratings back in the day:</p>

<p>Once again, here are the titles and additional versions from this series included in this collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force Leo</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One other Switch game that's recently popped up on the ESRB is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is due out next month.</p>

<p>This patch follows a launch update for the title on <strong>5th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about today's update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-adds-new-weapons-and-challenges-in-free-update-this-week">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already joined the fight in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>
