<p>The physical distributor Limited Run Games is teaming up with Marvel and Konami to revive multiple retro games in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection"><strong>Marvel</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection">Maximum Collection</a></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This superhero-sized collection, "coming soon" to Switch and other platforms, will feature six "classic titles" spanning across the Arcade, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles.</p>
<p>The collection covers multiple genres and promises to take fans on a "comprehensive tour" of Marvel's gaming legacy. It won't just feature one version of a particular title, either - it offers "every major console and arcade iteration" available.</p>
<p>Here are the titles included in this new collection, with rollback netcode also confirmed for X-Men: The Arcade Game.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: The Arcade Game (Arcade)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definitive mutant beat-’em-up returns! Experience the legendary cabinet action with full online multiplayer support for up to six players. Choose your favorite X-Man and take on Magneto’s army with the ultimate team-up experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade, Sega® Genesis/Mega Drive, NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take control of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Vision as you experience the cinematic arcade original or the unique platforming spin of the NES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the iconic comic crossover, gamers take to the streets of NYC battling hordes of nefarious bad guys, all to the sound of a rockin’ 16-bit soundtrack! Switch between the rich color palette of the Super Nintendo version, or dive in and enjoy the Genesis/Mega Drive version’s gritty vibe. Whatever you choose, carnage is guaranteed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superlative symbiote sequel! Go solo or team up in two-player co-op to take on the Life Foundation and Carnage’s offspring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy™, Game Gear™)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate Arcade’s deadly "Murderworld." This collection includes the handheld versions of the game, offering a fascinating look at Marvel's history of on-the-go gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Silver Surfer (NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test your Super Hero skills against one of the most infamously challenging shooters to ever grace a console! Featuring one of the greatest soundtracks in 8-bit history, this is a shooter that’s tough to master and tougher to put down!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Limited Run notes how this collection will feature "all new music from the legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck".</p>
<p>As usual with collections like this, you can also look forward to a host of features designed to scratch that retro "itch". This includes a digital archive (featuring box art, instruction manuals and more), a music player (including scores for every version of every game in the collection), rewind &amp; save states, cheat menus, and display options - allowing you to relive the CRT days.</p>
