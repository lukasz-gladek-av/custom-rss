<figure data-uuid="d9d7f196e5e75"><a title="TOTK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9d7f196e5e75/totk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Monolith Soft, the acclaimed developer behind the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> series, is also known to have collaborated with Nintendo on a number of first-party games, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worked closely with Nintendo on the Zelda series, starting with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword">Skyward Sword</a> in 2011. Now, the company has released <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html">a new interview</a> to celebrate its work on Zelda so far. Participants include Yasuhiro Fujita from Monolith Soft and Daiki Iwamoto from Nintendo, with the pair discussing how Monolith came to be involved with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The interview is only available in Japanese for the time being, but machine translation has at least been able to provide <em>some</em> idea of which subjects were up for discussion. One highlight includes how the team at Monolith felt a degree of anxiety at working on a Nintendo title with Skyward Sword, with both parties gaining more and more confidence with each successful project.</p>
<p>With Tears of the Kingdom, Monolith became involved from the early stages of development, with team members from Nintendo visiting the studio frequently to discuss ideas.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's clear that Monolith Soft has become an integral part of Nintendo's development structure. The team will no doubt continue to produce new entries in the Xenoblade Chronicles series going forward, but it'll be interesting to see just how involved it will be in new Zelda titles, too.</p>
<p>Iwamoto-san specifically states "I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch" at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>Could we possibly see a Zelda title developed solely by Monolith in the future..? Gosh, that's an exciting prospect.</p>

<figure data-uuid="93b02c5b899db"><a title="Wind Waker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93b02c5b899db/wind-waker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the latest update for the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube app (which added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a>), users are reporting "greatly reduced" input lag for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<p>According to a post on Reddit from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrisCube64/">ChrisCube64</a>, the reduced input lag has now made the game "actually playable". The original post reported lag of around 14 frames, but a follow-up comment noted that the speed running community timed the input lag at 6 frames. The update has now reportedly reduced this down to around 4 or 5 frames.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0hnjwlt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Still not perfect, then, but any improvement is a win. Other users are reporting reduced input lag for other titles on the GameCube app, but it seems the most notable improvement is on The Wind Waker. We've reached out to Nintendo to hopefully obtain official confirmation, and we'll update this article in due course.</p>
<p>The GameCube app now boasts a total of seven playable games, including the aforementioned Wind Waker and Wario World, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II.</a> More are on the way in the future, including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

<p>Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">teased</a> it earlier this year, but surprise! The free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo is now live on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html#Overview">Switch 2 eShop</a>.</p>
<p>We've got a new trailer (above) showcasing what you can expect from this one on Switch 2 and Xbox — though, if you have already played it elsewhere, the cutscene content will be old news.</p>
<p>The free demo will take you through the entirety of the opening Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission, and yes, your save data will carry over to the main game, so there's no need to worry about playing it all through again next year.</p>
<p>Those who play through the demo will be gifted the bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set” in the full game when it releases on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, FFVII Remake plays at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-confirms-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-runs-at-a-stable-30fps-on-switch-2">"stable" 30fps</a> on Switch 2, but that hasn't stopped everyone who has played it from having a wonderful time. We loved our time with the port when we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands-on at Gamescom</a> earlier this year, and Digital Foundry previously called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"The best-looking thing" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
