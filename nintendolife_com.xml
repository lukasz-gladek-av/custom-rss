<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>

<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>
