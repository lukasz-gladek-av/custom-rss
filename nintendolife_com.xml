<figure><a title="007 / Hitman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68598632611c7/007-hitman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Judging from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-that-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">recent gameplay reveal</a>, IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> is looking pretty marvellous, and it's heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">IGN</a>, game director Hakan Abrak has revealed that IO managed to secure the video game rights to James Bond in a rather amusing (albeit not entirely surprising) way. Essentially, the studio took the (digital) head of Daniel Craig, the most recent actor to portray Bond, and stuck it on Agent 47's body from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3qmizky&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The team then demonstrated how a Bond game would work by exploring the Sapienza level from 2016's Hitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there. We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game. And if you are acquainted with the franchise, there is a level called Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound. So we showed some things off there and, yeah, it was well received.</p>
<p>"I think what they saw in us and what we are also conveying is our angle would be to try to deliver a 360 experience where it's not necessarily about only shooting and cut scenes — there's certainly that in our game as well — but it's also being able to explore the part of the Bond fantasy where he is in social spaces where he is using not only his fisticuffs, but also his charms and bluff and figuring out different ways in those social spaces to overcome the obstacles or get what he wants. How would a charming Bond fare in a situation like this where he doesn't have to necessarily resort to violence?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we reckon it's safe to say that folks weren't exactly shocked to discover that IO, who really did tremendous work on the Hitman series, would be the ones to bring James Bond back into the world of video games. Hitman is basically Bond, but... maybe a bit more violent. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a fun little story about how that project came to be, and we can't wait to check out the full game next year. 007 First Light will be available via a standard edition priced at <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> along with a deluxe edition priced at <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong>.</p>

<p>Happy Hollowdays</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2088611c25fb5/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>The day is finally upon us! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> arrives on the Switch 2 (and Switch 1, have no fear) in just a few hours, with Team Cherry doing a global drop later on today.</p>
<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jmslzn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 7am PDT / 8am MDT / 9am CDT / 10am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 3pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 4pm CEST / 5pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 12am (Fri) AEST</li></ul>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>
