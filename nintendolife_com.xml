<p>Out on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">Dragon Quest I</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_ii">Dragon Quest II</a> are much-expanded compared to their original releases. There's tons of new story content, optional dungeons, quests, Mini Medals, skills, spells... the list goes on. Essentially, this is a transformative remake of two iconic classic RPGs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="GReZx3uoZNA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytGReZx3uoZNA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed640b4eqwytxk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>And we absolutely loved it: We scored the Nintendo Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">a glowing 9/10</a>, concluding that "Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is a deeply satisfying follow-up to last year’s remake project, closing out the Erdrick trilogy on a fittingly high note."</p>

<p>We know this series has a long line of fans who love playing these games on Nintendo consoles, and a lot of RPG fans have been pouring hours into both games this weekend. So we want to know what you think of Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, whether you're playing on Switch 1 or Switch 2.</p>
<p>As always, share your review score in the poll below (we've got separate ones for the Switch 1 and 2 releases), or swing by later when you've had a chance to play a bit more. Or, if you want, you can even leave one score now and then tweak it later on if you change your mind after a few more hours with it. These are <em>long</em> games!</p>

<p>You want to know what's better than 30fps?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameMill Entertainment has today announced that the family-friendly co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nicktoons_and_the_dice_of_destiny">Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</a> will be landing a free Switch 2 upgrade on <strong>5th December</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will run at 60fps, with a crisp 1240p resolution. There's a bunch of other visual good stuff to look out for too, including improved anti-aliasing, particle effects, lighting and more.</p>
<p>All those with the Switch 1 version of the game (which launched back in September), can upgrade to the Switch 2 version completely free. Alternatively, the full Switch 2 edition will be available on the Switch eShop for <strong>£39.99 / €49.99</strong>, or physically via a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the Switch 2 version in action:</p>

<p>If this one hasn't entered your sphere yet, the Dice of Destiny is an ARPG inspired by fantasy tabletop adventures. You'll put together a band of familiar Nickelodeon faces like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Susie Carmichael or Katara, and use each character's special skills to take out enemies in a magical land.</p>
<p>There's every chance that this one slipped under the radar for you back in a busy September period, and the new early-December release date falls in an equally jam-packed week, but hey, at least it gives everyone another chance to check it out.</p>
