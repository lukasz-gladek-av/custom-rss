<p>Part of a new event feat. Aespa</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following its Switch 2 release and the news of "five million global sales", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now announced its latest collab.</p>
<p>It's teaming up with the South Korean K-Pop group Aespa. Fighting fans can expect themed collab items, a limited-time Outfit 4 for Juri, and last but not least the virtual artist and idol Naevis, who will be added to the game as a new commentator.</p>
<p>These collab items will be made available across all versions of the game including the Switch 2 on <strong>4th July 2025</strong>. Juri's new outfit is available for "one year only", so get it while you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starting Friday, July 4, 2025, a special collaboration outfit with aespa will be released as Outfit 4 for Juri, available for one year only!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this special collaboration, the game's online Battle Hub will also be getting transformed with aespa-themed decorations. And if you log in during this event you can receive special times like new titles, device wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>Last week, Capcom confirmed Sagat would also be returning in August, with his Fighting Pass content scheduled to be made available on the same date as this new collab. Capcom has also revealed its next batch of outfits, which you can take a look at in our previous coverage.</p>

<figure><a title="Warner Bros. Animaniacs" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71c8225a059ab/warner-bros-animaniacs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF4PqtMVTCc&amp;t=7s&amp;ab_channel=WBKids">Warner Bros.</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>If you were a kid who grew up in the '90s, you've probably watched more than a handful of episodes of <strong>Animaniacs</strong>. The Warner Bros.-produced cartoon ran from 1993 to 1998 and received well over 250 episodes. And, you can bet there were many video games out there to accompany Yakko, Wakko, and Dot's animated antics.</p>
<p>In fact, there were nine different games between the SNES and DS eras, in fact, but a tenth, long-lost one has recently been rediscovered and preserved online (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/nearly-complete-prototype-of-cancelled-animaniacs-gba-game-surfaces-online">Time Extension</a>!); <strong>Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics</strong>, which is now fully preserved and playable online thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173">Hidden Palace</a>, MrPinball64, and Billscat-socks.</p>
<p>The 2D platformer, which mixes in puzzle-solving elements, was originally due to launch in 2003. It would've been the first Animaniacs game on the handheld console, but production woes, an insolvency procedure at Full Fat, and lack of a new publisher meant that the project was quietly cancelled.</p>

<p>As you'd expect, Pinky and the Brain are at it again, and in their quest for world domination, they've planned to turn the Warner Bros. Water Tower into a rocket, and in-turn have hypnotised all the actors and crew members at Warner Bros. That leads the Warner Bros. siblings, who are immune to the hypnotisation, to stop the evil duo's plans and save the studio.</p>
<p>After its cancellation, Hollywood Hypnotics was essentially thought lost for years, despite numerous screenshots and box art being available to view online. And <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics">according to Hidden Palace</a>, not even the former developer knew if the game was actually finished.</p>
<p>But yes, folks, it was <em>basically</em> done, with the whole game all the way to the final boss now playable online. Some visual inconsistencies and "rough around the edges" moments aside, this is essentially the game we were meant to get over two decades ago. And you can see just how it runs in a brief gameplay video from <a href="https://youtu.be/S6EQ4aeWY9M?si=SNta7vhtaunnf10c">GreenShield</a> below!</p>

<p>Hidden Palace has also shared two early builds of another Full Fat Games release — <strong>Justice League: Chronicles</strong>, which did in fact get a full release.</p>
<p>All of these releases are extremely important for video game preservation, particularly the Animaniacs game, which we all thought was lost media. Credit to the fans and communities who work tirelessly to ensure these projects are not lost to time.</p>

<figure><a title="Disney Speedstorm Stitch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a2d48e5229ac/disney-speedstorm-stitch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gameloft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gameloft has announced that its free-to-play online racer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a>, is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Shared via an in-game message (and reported on by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/30/disney-speedstorm-is-getting-a-nintendo-switch-2-update/">My Nintendo News</a>), the upgrade is due to arrive at the start of the new season, which lands on 3rd July.</p>
<p>Gameloft promises that the Switch 2 upgrade will mean the game will run at 6fps and will be 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked, which is a huge upgrade from the Switch 1 version. We're also getting "better shadows, anti-aliasing, and shader quality".</p>
<p>You can read the full statement below, shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneySpeedstormGame/comments/1lo1zmh/we_finally_got_an_update_on_switch_2_improvements/">DisneySpeedstormGame subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>We're definitely looking forward to seeing the improvements on the new console, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/disney-speedstorm">our biggest criticisms of the Switch 1 release</a> were the visuals and frame rate issues. The game was meant to hit 30fps, but it frequently struggled to reach that number, and it didn't look <em>great</em> in handheld either.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out what';s coming in Season 14 — alongside the Switch 2 update — in the trailer below.</p>

<p>With the Switch 2 update, hopefully this means fans will be able to enjoy the game on Nintendo's hardware.</p>
