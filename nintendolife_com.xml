<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef69b31de3c5d/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite some gripes with the D-pad, it was tough to imagine how Nintendo might improve on the Switch Pro Controller until we finally got our hands on the new one. And while it's a pricey upgrade and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-do-you-even-need-a-pro-controller-for-the-switch-2">one that you might want to put off</a> if you've got a perfectly functioning Switch 1 version, the Pro Controller 2 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a very nice bit of kit</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, industrious gamers have been dismantling the console and its accessories since launch, and <a href="https://gametraderzero.com/blogs/news/switch-2-pro-controller-tear-down-what-s-new-inside-nintendo-s-new-controller">GameTraderZero</a> has taken the new pad apart to see what makes it tick and how easy it will be to repair should something go wrong.</p>
<p>Giving us a good look at the innards, it appears that Nintendo turned to <a href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products-info/components/">Alps Alpine</a> (a Japanese company that specialises in automotive and consumer electronic components such as switches) to supply the sticks for this pad - or at least some of them.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lr5z4ewo622v">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, you can see the back of the stick module bearing the manufacturer's name and what appears to be a custom stick design for the Switch 2 controller.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly for people who like to repair, mod, or just fiddle with their gear, GameTraderZero points out that the design used means replacement is possible without the need to fetch the soldering iron. Hurrah!</p>
<p>However, they also point out that "more intricate internal design" of the pad and other factors make it more complicated to disassemble compared to the old version. If you've played Welcome Tour, Nintendo details the challenges of moulding the new pad in such a way that your hand wouldn't rest on grooves which would collect everyday grime and dust.</p>
<p>The intense interest in the Switch 2's analog(ue) sticks stems from the infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/joy--con-drift">Joy-Con drift</a>' issues that plagued the Switch 1's controllers. Teardowns of the new Joy-Con reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-owners-are-already-stripping-down-joy-con-to-check-the-stick-tech">sticks that look quite similar to the last-gen version</a>, too, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-end-of-joy-con-stick-drift-the-switch-2s-controllers-have-been-redesigned-from-the-ground-up">Nintendo says</a> they've been totally redesigned.</p>
<p>While the Pro Controller didn't suffer in the same way, it's nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-switch-2-sticks-might-not-be-hall-effect-but-they-feel-fantastic">these smooth-feeling upgrades</a> in the latest 'Pro' pad. Hopefully, they'll stand the test of time.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch-2-definitely-improved-but-segas-shafting-early-adopters.1213443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I originally reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_x_shadow_generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> on the Switch, I went bold and called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-x-shadow-generations">“the very best 3D Sonic game so far”</a> – a statement I very much stand by. The combination of the nostalgia-fueled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_generations">Sonic Generations</a> and the thrillingly dark, Shadow-focused expansion made it an experience that comfortably outranks even my beloved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a>. This remains the case on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So what’s changed with the new release? Well, hardly anything, to be honest. In terms of content, this is the exact same game you might have played back in 2024. That’s still quite a bit, mind you, with both Sonic and Shadow campaigns taking around five or six hours or so to reach the credits; more if you go for full completion. But still, if you’re hoping for a sprinkling of bonus content to justify the move to Nintendo’s new console, you won’t find it here.</p>
<p>What <em>has</em> changed is the performance and resolution. On the Switch 1, Sonic Generations managed to reach 1080p when docked, while Shadow Generations capped out at 720p. Both, however, are locked at 30fps. On the Switch 2, Sonic Generations defaults to 60fps while boasting much crisper visuals, bringing it more in line with the release on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<p>Shadow Generations, on the other hand, offers up two choices. Quality mode keeps the 30fps gameplay from Switch 1 and bumps up resolution, while performance mode doubles the frame rate. When docked, the visuals in performance mode still look pretty nice, resulting in a good balance between attractive graphics and smooth gameplay. In handheld mode, however, the characters and world definitely look a little muddy.</p>
<p>I’m not usually one to opt for prettier visuals over higher frame rates, but coming from the Switch 1 version took the sting out of the 30fps performance somewhat, and the bump in visuals felt like a nice upgrade in comparison. Performance mode feels perfectly fine for docked play, but I’ve no qualms switching over to quality mode for when I’m out and about.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with all of this is that Sega has opted to completely shaft those who bought the game on Switch 1, with no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version at all. Given the minimal enhancements, it feels like a proper kick in the teeth for fans - I can’t imagine many current owners are keen on parting with £45 / $50 for performance enhancements. Look to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> for an idea of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">how this should be done</a>.</p>
<p>So, whether you take a punt on Sonic X Shadow Generations for the Switch 2 will very much depend on whether you already own it or not. If you don’t, add two points to the score below and jump in: it’s a great game and this is undoubtedly the best way to play it on Nintendo systems. If you do, however, you should think twice about double-dipping. It’s already a splendid game on Switch 1, and with no upgrade path or new content, you're missing out on very little if you skip it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be"</p>

<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">posted on X</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that the movie was being delayed "for production reasons". The film's original release date was 26th March 2027, so it's only a few extra weeks.</p>
<p>"It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be."</p>

<p>The movie was originally announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/surprise-nintendo-is-officially-working-on-a-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie">back in November 2023</a>, with a release date revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-coming-march-2027">in March 2025</a> via the Nintendo Today! app.</p>
<p>The movie is being directed by Wes Ball, the man behind the camera on The Maze Runner and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.
