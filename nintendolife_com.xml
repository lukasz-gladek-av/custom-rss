<p>When the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives next February, Nintendo fans can look forward to a few extra goodies, such as a limited edition Pro Controller and eventually a themed amiibo.</p>
<p>As highlighted by many Nintendo enthusiasts online, it seems there will be one other exclusive. If you haven't already seen the title's cover art for the Switch 2 standard physical release, it's seemingly different to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions.</p>
<p>This custom cover for the Nintendo release will feature the game's protagonist, and FBI intelligence analyst, Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>As Nintendo Everything highlights, although the standard release will have different cover art for Switch 2 physical copies, it seems Capcom has decided to stick with the same design for the Deluxe Edition of the game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="365ac63fab41d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/365ac63fab41d/resident-evil-requiem.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>This unique cover for the Switch 2 standard version has already led to all sorts of speculation online. On Switch 2, Resident Evil Requiem is expected to offer the same gameplay experience as other platforms and will also be releasing at the same time on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It's also been previously confirmed the physical Switch 2 version is a Game-Key Card. Capcom will be offering a special 'Generation Pack' as well containing the new game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> (launching for Switch 2 on the same date).</p>

<p>Say goodbye to Godzilla and Hatsune Miku</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> was released on the Switch last June, and Sega followed it up with a bunch of DLC updates.</p>
<p>This included Godzilla and Hatsune Miku, who joined the roster on 26th November 2024. Now, a year later, Sega's Japanese <a href="https://x.com/SMB_JP/status/1990978490007761381?s=20">Super Monkey Ball social media account</a> has announced these same licensed characters will be delisted on <strong>26th November 2025</strong> (aka next week).</p>
<p>Here's a rough machine translation about the removal of the cheerful virtual singer and the king of the monsters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hatsune Miku and Godzilla - playable character available until next week, November 26th (Wednesday) Everyone hurry up"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no local update about these characters (or other characters) being delisted at the time of writing, but if you were planning on getting any of the DLC for this title, you might want to grab it while it's still available.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time this has happened, with the 2021 Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_mania">Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</a> also delisting DLC such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a> character Morgana.</p>
