<p>"Get ready for a whole new ball game"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last weekend, Nintendo held a special 'Global Jam' for the Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>This game is described as "the next generation" of 3-on-3 sports, where you use the mouse controls to speed around the court, and flick your wrists to perform tricks and shoot some hoops. To top it off, you can join in on the fun with up to 12 players online.</p>
<p>So, now that the Global Jam has ended, and we've even had the chance to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-shoot-some-hoops-with-drag-x-drives-dev-team-this-weekend">take on the game's developers</a> during the same event, we're wondering about your first impressions and if you're planning to add it to your game library on release.</p>
<p>Leave a comment and vote in our poll. You can also see the skills of the developers in the video above.</p>

<p>Drag x Drive will launch on the eShop for the Switch 2 on <strong>14th August, 2025</strong> and is priced at <strong>$19.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>

<p>Treasure Tracker also got a Switch 2 upgrade recently</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has received its weekly update today and this time it adds the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to listen to tracks like the game's title theme, The King of Pyropuff Peak and much more. All up, this album contains a total of <strong>58 tracks</strong> and has a runtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>To listen to this soundtrack on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>This follows an update to the app last week which added the soundtracks for the Pilotwings series. The app was also recently updated to Version 1.3.0 – adding the ability to use some functions of the app, even without an active Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was originally released on the Wii U, and was followed up with a 3DS and Switch release. It was also one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free game upgrades</a> released alongside the Switch 2 recently, optimising the game visuals, and adding HDR and GameShare support.</p>

<figure><a title="Paper Mario N64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e558bc1801db/paper-mario-n64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>25 years ago today, 11th August, Mario jumped into a whole new dimension.</p>
<p>Today marks the anniversary of the N64 turn-based RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> — which is a pretty big deal, because that means the entire series is <em>also</em> celebrating its quarter-century anniversary. Feeling old yet?</p>
<p>Originally planned to be developed by Square — who previously teamed up with Nintendo to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> on the SNES — Intelligent Systems took the helm for what became the first of many papercraft adventures for Mario. And for many, the original (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a>) are the high watermark for the series.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf from Mario's previous RPG outing, Paper Mario uses similar reaction timing-based combat but, instead of a party of three, Mario only has one other companion join him both in battle and in the overworld.</p>

<p>Throughout the story, Mario has various different companions join his team, each with different skill sets. Each companion represents a different type of enemy within the Mario universe — fan favourite Lady Bow is a Boo, for example, while Sushie is a Cheep Cheep.</p>
<p>Those skills aren't exclusive to combat, as every character has an ability that Mario can use to explore. Goombario's skill is that he can tell you all about the location you're in. Parakarry, the Paratroopa, allows you to cross large gaps, and Sushie gives Mario the ability to swim.</p>
<p>The game also introduced Badges, equipable items that give Mario boosts, effects, and sometimes new moves.</p>
<p>Plus, don't forget that amazing magazine ad from before the game's release:</p>

<p>Much of Paper Mario's spirit and skills would carry on in The Thousand-Year Door, the GameCube sequel that got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">a remake on Switch in 2024</a>, but the series gradually moved away from traditional turn-based combat, experimenting with gameplay gimmicks beyond the standard RPG ones.</p>
<p>Still, the franchise wouldn't exist without the charming N64 original, which you can play on the N64 Nintendo Classics (formerly NSO) service if you have the Expansion Pack tier. The latest entry in the series is 2020's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">The Origami King</a>, which is available on Switch - hopefully it'll get a Switch 2 upgrade at some point!</p>
