            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>One of the most unique video games of 2024 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a>, a third-person adventure game where you play as a nun who has a connection to the Devil itself. It's a surreal, absurd adventure and it addresses faith, religion, and authority with a darkly comic (and tragic) tone.</p>
<p>And now, Odd Meter's extremely unusual title is coming to Switch on <strong>17th November</strong>, with a physical version following over a week later, on <strong>28th November</strong>. The above trailer (via Gematsu) <em>really</em> doesn't give away much except that there's nothing else quite like it!</p>
<p>But, if you need a little encouragement, just last month, Indika won the Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards, presented by none other than <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> and <strong>Kirby</strong> maestro Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, Sakurai gave the audience some background on the game, and detailed what makes it special — in the form of a short movie. Well, it's a lot of recorded gameplay with some explanations of some of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Sakurai praises the variety, the atmosphere, the story, and the questions it pushes onto the player (approximately translated via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPvWz3_lY">the Japan Game Awards stream</a>).</p>
<p>For more details on the game, we'll throw it over to the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Surreal Journey Through 19th-Century Russia<br></strong>Set in an alternative Russia at the turn of the 19th century, <em>INDIKA</em> follows a young nun as she ventures beyond the monastery walls, accompanied by the most unexpected companion imaginable: the devil himself. What begins as a simple errand quickly transforms into a surreal and darkly comic odyssey, exploring themes of faith, authority, comedy, and tragedy with a uniquely inventive twist.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Indika: Not Your Ordinary Nun<br></strong>Indika appears to live a quiet, monastic life, but her unlikely friendship with the horned tempter drags her into a world where the sacred collides with the profane. Every step reveals new mysteries and challenges, immersing players in a story reminiscent of Dostoyevsky’s depth and Bulgakov’s surreal humour.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a Bold Indie Vision<br></strong>Developed by Odd Meter, <em>INDIKA</em> blends atmospheric exploration, dark humour, and inventive puzzles across surreal landscapes. Its distinctive style is punctuated by 2D pixel-art mini-games that reveal hidden layers of Indika’s past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br></strong>- Third-person, story-driven adventure with darkly comic tones<br>
- A young nun’s journey of self-discovery across a surreal reimagining of 19th-century Russia<br>
- The devil as an unlikely and mischievous companion<br>
- Puzzle-solving and exploration interwoven with narrative<br>
- Surreal, atmospheric environments with striking visual design<br>
- 2D pixel-art mini-games that illuminate Indika’s backstory</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Our sister site Push Square reviewed the game back in May 2024, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">were full of praise</a>. One for the radar, we think.</p>

<p><em>Indika launches on Switch next month on 17th November. Will you be checking this one out? let us know in the comments!</em></p>

<p>Final Masterpiece Edition is coming this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1bc9826b0b856"><a title="Layers of Fear" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bc9826b0b856/layers-of-fear.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has announced that it is releasing a new version of <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> on the Nintendo Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, the game was announced as part of the company's <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/2025/10/09/bloober-team-ujawnia-aktualny-kalendarz-wydawniczy-swoich-projektow/">latest financial report</a>, in which it describes the release as "a complete edition of the iconic Layers of Fear series".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's not completely clear what this actually is. Bloober launched the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a> in 2016 and followed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">a sequel</a> in 2019. The original was re-released on the Switch in 2018 as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a>, and Bloober then created a remake/sequel in 2023 that was also called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>. Yeah, not confusing at all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvszrl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Our assumption is that the Final Masterpiece Edition will be an enhanced port of the latest Layers of Fear, and not another re-release of the original 2016 game. This means it'll take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5 on the Switch 2 while combining stories from the first two titles.</p>
<p>We're certain Bloober will be sharing more details soon either way, so we'll be sure to update you as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In addition, it's also been confirmed that the isometric title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a> has been delayed into the new year and will now launch on <strong>29th January 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>The first creation from Nintendo Pictures</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ad41a3823b1ca"><a title="Close To You" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad41a3823b1ca/close-to-you.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">'Close To You'</a> <strong>Pikmin</strong> short was created by its newly-established company, <a href="https://nintendo-pictures.co.jp/">Nintendo Pictures</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">X</a>, Nintendo simply said, "These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content". As such, it seems reasonable to assume that the videos are nothing more than that – videos.</p>
<p>So don't expect 'Close To You' to lead into some new game announcement or update, because it sounds like this was merely a one-off for Nintendo Pictures; a proof-of-concept, if you will, to demonstrate the studios talents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>
The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>
These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it was a nice little distraction in what has otherwise been a fairly quiet week so far. It's also a nice indication of the sort of quality we can expect from Nintendo Pictures going forward – it was really good!</p>
<p>We'd love to see a new Pikmin game, of course, but we're not expecting one anytime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> was released in 2023, a whole <em>decade</em> after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/pikmin_3">previous entry</a> on Wii U. We did recently theorise, however, that it would make for a really good Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Make it happen, Nintendo.</p>
