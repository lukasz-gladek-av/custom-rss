<figure data-uuid="046aaf27c8ac8"><a title="Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/046aaf27c8ac8/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, the day is finally upon us. Today is the last day that you can buy Switch Game Vouchers before Nintendo consigns them to the 'Discontinued' pile.</p>
<p>The Big N initially made the announcement way back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">July 2025</a>, but time has flown by since then, so we thought it was only right to give you one last nudge now that the day of reckoning is upon us.</p>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm</strong> in your timezone to make any final purchases, and the vouchers will be valid for one year from the point you buy them — so any that you pick up today won't expire until 30th January 2027. As ever, you'll need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to get the vouchers in the first place.</p>
<p>For those who have missed out on this offer until today, Switch Game Vouchers come in pairs and can be used on select first-party digital purchases — saving you a few quid in the process. A pair of vouchers costs £84 / $99.98, which, when used on two full-price Switch 1 releases, knocks £16 / $20 off the combined price. It's a pretty sweet deal, we must admit.</p>
<p>While Game Vouchers cannot be used on Switch 2 exclusives, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to add Switch 1 releases to the scheme throughout 2026. Just yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is a part of the Voucher programme and new releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are available in it too (both of which have a paid upgrade option to Switch 2, if you choose to do that down the line).</p>
<p>You can find the full list of eligible games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0" rel="noopener">Nintendo's website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most of this offer before it's gone, either head over to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo website</a> and sign in with your active NSO account, or head to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' section of the eShop on your Switch / Switch 2 and select 'Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers'. Do keep in mind that you can't have more than eight active Vouchers on your account at once, so don't go crazy out there!</p>
<p>So long, partner!</p>
