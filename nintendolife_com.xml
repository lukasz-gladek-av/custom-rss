<p>It's almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a long wait and even some delays, we're now just weeks out from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>The 'hands on' previews have been rolling in from Gamescom this week, so we're rounding up a handful here including our own. This is the final demo before the game goes on sale to the public on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's a summary of our own thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think you'll all love it, if you do like Hollow Knight - they've absolutely smashed it here... it runs beautifully...the atmosphere, the graphics, it all just plays totally perfect together"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what did other outlets have to say? Here's the rundown:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2025/">GamesRadar+:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight-silksong/preview">PCGamesN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong feels exactly like we hoped it would. Beautiful yet brutal. Charming yet challenging. It doesn't seem like a massive departure from the original, but with a few tweaked and rebalanced techniques, it still freshens up the formula."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">Eurogamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is the game of the moment. And Team Cherry has opted to make this more difficult and a bit more awkward. For platforming fans like me, that's catnip - but will the average player curious in the franchise be so intrigued?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">Insider Gaming:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-preview-gamescom/">The Gamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I saw nothing to suggest it is reinventing the wheel, although I don’t doubt there will be more than a few abilities to differentiate things. In my humble opinion, this isn’t a bad thing. Hollow Knight is such a unique Metroidvania, that another story in that world is fine by me. After the eternal wait, we’re agonisingly close to playing Team Cherry’s next adventure, and it already feels like it was worth the wait."</p>

<p>Bunny hop</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment and Little Sewing Machine have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a>, a horror game inspired by Don Bluth and animated Disney movies, is launching on Switch on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>, just in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>The date was announced yesterday via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPc5ya2f_Y0">IGN Live Showcase</a>, with Maximum Entertainment sharing the trailer earlier today.</p>
<p>Taking place in the early 1900s in Britain against the backdrop of the women's suffrage movement, Bye Sweet Carole follows Lana Benton as she searched for her missing best friend, Carole Simmons. This takes her to Bunny Hall orphanage, a place that hiding a dark truth.</p>
<p>And part of that mystery takes her to a Wonderland-esque world, the kingdom of Crolla, that is under the control of Mr Kyn, a terrifying figure, and a group of ravenous rabbits. Will she find Carole? And will Lana make it home with her friend safely?</p>
<p>Lana won't be alone, though — she makes friends with a shape-shifting creature called Mr Baesie, and certain sections of the game have you controlling him. Lana herself can also change into a bunny rabbit, because of course — they do like their bunnies here.</p>


<p>Ahead of the game's release date announcement, we got to chat with Bye Sweet Carole's director, Chris Darril, best known as the creator of the <strong>Remothered</strong> series. Keep an eye out for our interview this weekend!</p>
<p>A physical release has also been confirmed for <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1958923256670405091">21st October in North America</a>, which will include the game, a digital OST, and a reversible cover sheet.</p>
<p>With the game dropping on Switch right around spooky season, we're looking forward to diving into this one by the fireplace. <em>Let us know if you're doing the same in the comments</em>.</p>
