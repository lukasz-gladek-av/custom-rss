<p>Let's play hide-and-seek!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're looking for a little bit of lightness this holiday season for you and the kids, then hopefully you've been saving up a bunch of those <strong>It's Me, Mario!</strong> shorts. Nintendo has been sharing these on its family-friendly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@playnintendo">Play Nintendo YouTube Channel</a> since August 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkVH3EaHbL4">Episode 5</a> dropped overnight and features Mario with Yoshi and Toad, who are playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Mario must find both of his friends, who have found devious places to keep themselves out of the plumber's eyesight.</p>
<p>And look, we're extremely partial to stop-motion animation, but Yoshi and Toad look particularly adorable; we love the little Super Mario World nod with the trees and the fruit, and Toad is... well, Toad! He can hide in some pretty easy places in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>All five shorts have some lovely little callbacks to the Mario series as a whole, so while the kids might delight in the lovely colours and animations, parents (or grandparents, or uncles, aunts — whoever!) can get all nostalgic. You can see all five currently released episodes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLngvvr1C2bLGRo0H8Lwl33utYqofaMDT3">this playlist</a>.</p>
<p>The It's Me, Mario! shorts are actually designed to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-nintendo-updates-its-my-mario-product-line-with-multiple-new-yoshi-items-heres-a-look"><strong>My Mario</strong> range of toys for young children</a>, which were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">released in Japan back in August this year</a>. A selection of these are coming to the US in 2026.</p>

<p>One last deep dive before the end of the year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c60d28f82f310"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c60d28f82f310/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/yakuza-kiwami-3--dark-ties-direct-airs-tuesday-december-23">have announced</a> that they will be airing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> Direct next week, which launches on Switch 2 on 12th February 2026.</p>
<p>The Direct will be a late one for UK and European folks, with the stream kicking off on <strong>23rd December 2025 at 1am GMT / 2am ET</strong> — that's <strong>22nd December at 5pm PT / 8pm ET</strong> for those in North America. It'll be available on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SEGA_West">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sega">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>As for what to expect, well, it's a deep dive — that's basically all we know! "This Direct will dive into new features, experiences, and gameplay from the upcoming two-in-one title" Sega says. So expect a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>We wonder whether we'll get any hints as to what this enhanced version of the 2009 PS3 title means for the future of the series RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-more-than-just-a-remake-and-it-contains-major-hints-for-series-future">teased this himself a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>So, tune in next week to find out what to expect from Kiryu's third (fourth?) chapter.</p>
