<p>The official PR release has got all the deets you need, fellow dino-hunters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nightdive Studios’ remastered Turok trilogy is renowned for modernizing the iconic games and bringing an epic saga to current-generation platforms. When it was first released in 1997, Turok introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore. All three of these classic games feature upgraded gameplay, high-resolution textures, enhanced lighting and rendering, and support for console gamepads with platform-specific features to sink your teeth into!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok</strong><br>
A world where time has no meaning and evil knows no bounds. Torn from a world long gone, the time-traveling warrior Turok has found himself thrust into an unknown land torn by conflict. An evil overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</strong><br>
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately, the blast awakens an even deadlier force — the Primagen. Once again, Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The sequel to the hit game Turok features a host of enemies, weapons, missions, locations, and a new multiplayer mode.<br></em><em><strong><em><br>
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em></strong></em><em><br>
In the third game in the classic trilogy, players choose between dual protagonists Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> protagonist Joshua Fireseed. Together, they must defeat the titular antagonist Oblivion and its followers, the Flesh Eaters, after the supposed demise of their brother at its hands.</em></p>

<p>"The response far exceeded our expectations"</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b229a5954056/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today held its 85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, during which president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for not being able to meet initial demand for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NStyles" tabindex="-1">@NStyles</a> on X, a shareholder asked whether there was a specific reason for the shortage of consoles and whether Nintendo had failed to predict the overwhelming response from consumers at launch.</p>
<p>Furukawa was understandably coy regarding specifics, but apologised for not being able to meet demand, acknowledging that even a few shareholders have not been able to get their hands on the Switch 2 yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</p>
<p>"Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>"As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When discussing the lottery system in more detail during a later question, Furukawa stated that the company had received both positive and negative feedback, and aims to improve the system further for future product launches.</p>
<p>Furukawa also states the importance of including the Nintendo Account as a qualifying factor in applying for the lottery, noting that relationships with customers often ended in the past when moving onto a new hardware generation. He believes the Nintendo Account is crucial in maintaining "long and positive" relationships with customers.</p>
