<p>Miyamoto doesn't even get a "special thanks"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fans Have Noticed Someone's Name Is Missing From Mario Kart World's Credits 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0139ff4fd04ab/fans-have-noticed-someones-name-is-missing-from-mario-kart-worlds-credits-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous video game designers the world has ever seen and is responsible for giving us classic franchises such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-super-mario-games-of-all-time">Super Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-zelda-games-of-all-time">Zelda</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pikmin-games">Pikmin</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-star-fox-games-of-all-time">Star Fox</a>.</p>
<p>One of his most critically and commercially successful creations is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart</a>, a series that has sold in excess of 189 million copies worldwide since its inception in 1992 with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>.</p>
<p>However, it has been noted that his name is completely absent from the credits for the latest entry in the franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>:</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Miyamoto hasn't been credited in a Mario Kart game—his name is also missing from the smartphone release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>—but this is the first mainline instalment which doesn't appear to have had any input from the legendary designer.</p>
<p>You may recall that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-shigeru-miyamoto-apparently-isnt-credited-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">his name didn't feature</a> in last year's Zelda game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, either.</p>
<p>On one level, this isn't all that surprising; Miyamoto has shifted into an advisory role with a wider scope in recent years, as befits his senior standing within Nintendo. However, it does feel odd not to see his name appear in the credits, even as a "special thanks".</p>
<p>Were you expecting to see Miyamoto's name in the game's credits? Let us know with a comment below. And if you're interested in seeing those credits for yourself (as seen when you complete the Special Cup), check out this video:</p>

<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156456/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> What's this? A non-Switch 2 game?!? Variety, my friends, is the spice of Nintendo Life...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A goofy life sim set in a physics-based sandbox, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wobbly_life">Wobbly Life</a> by RubberBandGames is an entertaining amalgam of open-world adventure and indie party games. With its cartoonish tone and compulsive gameplay, it's clearly targeting younger players, but buckets of charm make it just as enjoyable for adults.</p>
<p>You play as a hapless Wobbler who is unceremoniously kicked out of their home by Grandma. Told to stop playing video games, get a job, and buy a house, your character is nothing if not relatable.</p>
<p>The whole island and its surrounding biomes are open to you from the beginning. Navigating this vast space and becoming a successful Wobbler forms the core loop of the game's World mode.</p>
<p>To earn enough money to become a homeowner and appease your overbearing grandma, you'll need to take on a variety of part-time jobs scattered across the map. Some of these are simple, like picking up taxi fares within a generous time limit. Others are a calculated test of patience and precision.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156447/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You start small, by picking up odd jobs around the neighbourhood. The first of these tasks is to fetch jelly from the supermarket and deliver it to a neighbour. Simple enough, right? The challenge becomes apparent when you realise that every inhabitant on this island is a stiff, humanoid blob. Lugging that tutorial jelly around quickly becomes a lesson in the game’s unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>Your Wobbler animates with the same awkward, floppy physics as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> contestant, which makes even mounting a small pavement something that needs prior calculation. Every task on Wobbly Island is subject to the janky hobble of your character and the erratic motion of the objects they manipulate.</p>
<p>Each of your Wobbler’s arms is controlled by the left and right triggers. Holding in the triggers will thrust an appendage out and stick onto any surface they make contact with. Most tasks require you to grab and transport items to specific locations, demanding careful coordination. Certain jobs, such as the hamburger chef, introduce an extra layer of challenge by requiring quick, responsive management of your grip and the momentum of ingredients.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/5021/embed @ 1749376800 -->
<p>It takes some getting used to, and much of the game’s comedy stems from fumbling through this process. Wobbler arms stick to any surface, resulting in awkward accidents, like trying to pick up a well-caught fish, only to realise you're fused to the floor.</p>
<p>While the game is perfectly playable solo, most of its mechanics and minigames are clearly designed to be tackled as part of a group. Many of the part-time jobs involve driving around with some form of cargo, from pizzas to nuclear waste. Doing this alone is often laborious, and sometimes outright impossible. Earning money and taking on jobs with others transforms irritation into entertainment.</p>
<p>The multi-stage nature of the minigames demands self-organisation and stress management, much like in popular friendship destroyers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/overcooked_all_you_can_eat">Overcooked</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moving_out">Moving Out</a>. There's splitscreen local co-op for up to four players and all modes can be played online, so there’s plenty of ways to live that wobbly life together.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156450/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing alongside others makes earning money a breeze. If you all work together, some of the more difficult jobs — like firefighter or paramedic — get a lot easier to manage. It's a shame that fishing is the best money earner in the early game, because it's also the most sedate and requires little cooperation.</p>
<p>Outside of the impressive open world, which is jam-packed with secrets and activities — not least the endless clothing combos and pets — there's an arcade that pits Wobblers against each other in three competitive modes. Hide and Seek is self-explanatory, while Trash Zone has Wobblers competing to throw garbage into a compactor. The best arcade title is Wobble Run, which is a thinly veiled copy of Fall Guys. These modes are a worthy distraction when you get tired of the Island rat race.</p>
<p>Capping off the arcade suite is Sandbox mode, which places Wobblers in an open arena with the freedom to experiment with the game's assets. The near-endless possibilities offered here should vastly increase the longevity of this game beyond its other modes.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One small caveat emerges when playing with a full local party: Joy-Con control. Wrestling with the deliberately stiff and erratic physics on the smaller controller is a physically demanding experience. Little ones will be fine, but adults with full-sized appendages should expect some cramp.</p>
<p>Other than that small physical niggle, Wobbly Life is lighthearted fun for all ages. There is so much to do in the open world, including a bonkers story mode and a wealth of customisation options. Pile on a bunch of other ways to play and this is a generous package wrapped up in a silly bow.</p>
<p>It can be a bit of a slog when played solo, but this game is clearly designed from the ground up to be enjoyed with friends and family. Pro tip: If you're the type of player who gets tired of your bickering party, just hit the ragdoll button and go limp. Let them carry you for a change.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wobbly Life isn't doing anything new with the physics-based party genre, but it offers tons of content and a great time for all ages. The arcade and sandbox modes will keep you coming back long after life on Wobbly Island gets boring.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, you! Wrap up that Knockout Tour, it's time for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>ing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes-dreamcast">Last week</a>, we hopped over to the Dreamcast and took a look at three different covers for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a>. While there was a decent spread of votes, it was the Japanese variant that walked away with the win, taking 55% of the vote and leaving North America and Europe with the remaining 31% and 14%, respectively.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something vaguely related to the Switch 2-shaped elephant in the room this time, but we've covered just about every launch title in previous Brawls. Then it hit us. A Nintendo console launching with a <strong>Street Fighter</strong> game? Where have we seen that before?</p><p><figure data-videoid="dFHTTcnGF1w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3937a0uwozph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFHTTcnGF1w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Sure, some of you might be tucking into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2 this weekend, but we're thinking about the <em>last time</em> the series graced a Nintendo launch line-up as we take a look at the 3DS' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for very similar designs on this one, so it's a good old-fashioned face-off against the Japanese variant. Let's meet the fighters, shall we?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:15042 @ 1749381127 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99a6e64f48892/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American / European design is pretty badass, we'll admit. Ryu takes centre stage, naturally, but we like how the rest of the roster extends out behind him, each reimagined in an almost hand-sketched art style. The sepia tones are throwing us off a little bit, but we're suckers for a giant floating head in the sky, and this design has three of 'em!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6b989477c851/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese artwork goes for something slightly different. The hand-drawn aesthetic has been dialled up a couple of notches, though the previous roster has been replaced with close-ups of Ryu, Chun-Li and Akuma, while Juri and Guile loom in the background. It's a little less cohesive than the last design, but we like the action poses.</p>

<figure><a title="Splatoon 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bae9f7be2982/splatoon-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has gone to the extent of providing a series of free upgrades for select Switch titles on the Switch 2, and it's even rolled out updates for other first-party games, but it seems one other title might need a look.</p>
<p>According to reports, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> community has discovered a new bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> on Switch 2 – allowing squid kids to "squid roll" on "any surface, regardless of if it is inked in your colour". This was originally shared by a user known as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/diolass.bsky.social/post/3lqyctc7ylk2e">'Diolass' on Bluesky</a>, who described it as "game-breaking" on the competitive front.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12eztgpon&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>While it's not clear why exactly this is happening, dataminer 'OatmealDome' speculates it "might be an issue with Switch 1 GPU emulation/translation since Splatoon games have had issues with ink detection in unofficial emulators due to bugs in their GPU emulation".</p>
<p>Switch 2 backward compatibility obviously still has some issues, with Nintendo officially releasing a list of games with issues and titles in the process of being fixed. Even some apps like YouTube aren't available at launch.</p>
<p>If we hear about any updates or patches for Splatoon 3 on the Switch 2, we'll let you know. How are you finding this series on Nintendo's new system so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Retro game collections are all the rage nowadays and following in the footsteps of classic mascots like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy</a> are now Joe and Mac.</p>
<p>This new package, officially titled <strong>Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection</strong>, is slightly different as it's a Kickstarter project scheduled to go live on <strong>10th June</strong> (aka next week) and is expected to release later this year digitally on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>It will contain the following three 16-bit Super Nintendo releases from Data East:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> (<em>ジョーとマック 戦え原始人</em>) is a Run &amp; Gun platformer that follows the titular Joe &amp; Mac as they fight through 12 hellish levels using prehistoric (but not just) tools and weapons. While the game was censored when it came out in the West, the Retro Collection also includes the original Japanese version!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/congos_caper">Congo's Caper</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Congo's Caper</em> (<em>戦え原始人2 ルーキーの冒険</em>) is a side-scrolling Action platformer centered around Congo, a half-human, half-monkey boy looking to rescue his girlfriend from a demon through 35 varied levels."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac_2_lost_in_the_tropics">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Joe &amp; Mac: Lost in the Tropics</em> (<em>ジョーアンドマック戦え原始人3主役はやっぱり</em>) adds a light roleplaying aspect to the series. While the goal is still to defeat cavemen and dinosaurs, players can court and wed their Stone Age girlfriend, and even have a child with her!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this collection is comprised of games released here in the West in the early 90s (1991 - 1995) as well as the "uncensored" Japanese versions.</p>
<p>There'll also be "multiple new features" including quality-of-life improvements like the ability to rewind gameplay, save states, customisable aspect ratios, a CRT filter, local co-op for Joe &amp; Mac 1 and 2, and "cool new visuals and merchandise" to go with this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>This campaign is led by G-Mode, Red Art Games and their "award-winning internal studio" Red Art Studios. If you're curious to revisit this prehistoric franchise there are also multiple options on the Switch, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/joe_and_mac">Nintendo's Switch Online Classics</a> game library.</p>

<p>YouTube asks Switch 2 users to "stay tuned" for updates, so for now, you're going to have to go without this popular video app on your Switch 2.

<figure><a title="Princess Peach: Showtime!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4e42c306f2f9/princess-peach-showtime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2023 marked a new era for the character, with the legendary voice actor Charles Martinet officially replaced by Kevin Afghani as Mario. It led to questions at the time about what other voices might be swapped out in the future.</p>
<p>While Peach's voice actor Samatha Kelly returned in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> the following year, it seems she's now been replaced after 18 years. This also includes her role as Toad. According to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">post on her Instagram</a> account, the voice actor found out yesterday after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had been released.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MZ5pbSbsoJA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41ed20wijkrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ5pbSbsoJA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Samantha Kelly:</strong> "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I’m sad that it’s over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I’m grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love #princesspeach #toad"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Kelly was in the role for nearly two decades (and voiced various other Mario characters during this time) her departure has obviously been far less public than Charles Martinet, who was given an official send-off by Nintendo and crowed the title of "Mario Ambassador" – going on to promote the character at events.</p>
<p>In some other news, it appears Takashi Nagasako is also reportedly no longer voicing Donkey Kong after 20 years. You can see the latest Mario voice actor update in <a href="https://youtu.be/gyHq-wRvmds?si=-6M4eE5mwCU_csyB&amp;t=47">Mario Kart World's credits</a>.</p>

<p>"Mario Kart World is going to move a lot of Switch 2"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has the most graphical horsepower we've ever seen in the history of the Mario Kart series, and if you're eager to know the exact details about how this game is performing on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has now delivered its tech review.</p>
<p>In the Switch 2's portable and tabletop mode, racers can expect a resolution of 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TV image quality is generally fine...holding up well on a 4K television set from a typical viewing distance. Docked mode also gets a touch of post-process image treatment to adjust the 1440p resolution...handheld mode fairs a bit better though, despite its lower pixel count. There's no anti-aliasing of any kind here, so the 1080p pixel count maps perfectly onto the 1080p Switch 2 display."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> was 1080p docked and 720p in portable mode. This results in World looking a "lot cleaner" even if it is still imperfect.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance, Digital Foundry found its experience to be "faultless" - with the frame rate locked at 60fps in the content tested, although photo mode drops the experience to 30fps. On the portable front, it's believed to run at the same frame rate as its docked counterpart.</p>
<p>The team also tested out the split screen as well as the GameChat functionality and found there weren't any performance concerns to the player experience. Regarding load times, these were also "fairly speedy" on the system's internal storage and comparable to a lot of current-generation titles.</p>
<p>HDR is also a nice addition and while it looks decent on TVs, don't expect much from the LCD panel in portable mode. All up, though, Digital Foundry sums up this next-generation entry as a "tremendous accomplishment" and is seriously impressed by the scope of what's been achieved here in terms of the massive open-world scale with very few compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visually speaking, World offers some beautiful sights with key rendering advances over prior Mario Kart games, though a lot of rendering power has gone into making the open world work. It's really the incredible quality of Nintendo's artistry that stands out the most here...plus it packs good resolution and frame rate metrics in portable and docked play without the low internal resolutions that typify a lot of early Switch 2 software."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
