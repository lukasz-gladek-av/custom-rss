<p>Fortune of battle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Closing out today's Nintendo Direct was a surprise announcement — we're getting a brand new Fire Emblem game on Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a> looks absolutely incredible and appears to take place in an arid region with a huge colosseum seemingly a central feature.</p>
<p>Expect more tactical gameplay, some rather lovely character designs, and a few hints at some interconnected lore...</p>
<p>Here's what we know so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Heroic Games have begun. The newest entry in the Fire Emblem series is set to enter the arena. The debut trailer provided a glimpse of the intertwining story, characters and turn-based tactical RPG gameplay that awaits players when the game launches for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>And it's not a Cloud Version!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following recent rumours, Capcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will launch on the Switch 2 alongside the other platforms on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This entry will follow Grace Ashcroft as she investigates mysterious deaths, including that of her mother, <strong>RE: Outbreak's</strong> Alyssa Ashcroft. The game will also feature the ruined remains of Raccoon City and the R.P.D station.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil: Village</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 on the same date. Both titles originally launched on the Switch as Cloud Versions to much criticism, so hopefully these native versions will go toward restoring some faith from Nintendo fans.</p>
