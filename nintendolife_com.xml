<p>UK, Australia, and the US affected</p>

<p>Eager <strong>Trails</strong> fans, old and new, are getting their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> today, the remake of the 2004 RPG from Falcom that kicked off the Trails series. With Limited Run Games and Clear River Games handling Steelbook and Bracer Editions, a lot of love and care seems to have gone into this remake.</p>
<p>But today, both physical edition publishers have revealed that they've hit issues in getting those special editions in the hands of some customers (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lz6vmo4zuc23">Wario64</a>)</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has been emailing those who pre-ordered the game about "unexpected manufacturing delays" for both the steelbook and Bracer Edition, and that these will now be "shipping out later than the initially planned date of September 19, 2025."</p>

<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), European distributor <a href="https://x.com/clearrivergames/status/1968993500042547307?s=19">Clear River Games states</a> that "We began fulfilling all Trails in the SKy steelbook orders earlier this week, despite the games arriving at our warehouse later than expected due to production delays."</p>
<p>While it has managed to ship orders across the EU, the UK, Australia, and other regions, "complications with our shipping partner" have caused other regions to be hit by delays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Clear River says it has finally found a solution, and the remaining orders will be shipped today. Hopefully this bodes well for Limited Run Games pre-orders too.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the wait isn't too long for those of you who are big Trails fans — the remake has been getting rave reviews, and this is the perfect entry point for newcomers, too.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like we're essentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-contains-teaser-for-the-sequel">guaranteed to get a remake of the sequel</a>, given what footage has been shared online by those who go to the game early.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d88e5933be/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> surprised many when it was revealed at last week's Nintendo Direct; we've already got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on the way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">III HD Remake</a> is already out. Surely the next logical step is the <strong>Zenithian Trilogy</strong> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iv">IV</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_vi_realms_of_revelation">VI</a>?</p>
<p>Well, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii spoke about the upcoming game on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DaeJ3TFMFM">Yuubou &amp; Mashirito no KosoKoso Housoukyoku channel</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/18468-yuji-horii-comments-on-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-coming-before-dragon-quest-iv-v-vi-remakes">RPG Site</a>!), where he co-hosts monthly streams with former Weekly Shonen Jump editor-in-chief Kazuhiko "Mashirito" Torishima.</p>
<p>During a stream earlier this week, on 15th September, the duo are talking about the upcoming Dragon Quest remake, with Torishima casually mentioning the next one isn't IV, V, or VI.</p>
<p>Horii's response, around 44:45, is predictably vague (all translations by RPG Site): "A lot of things are moving around, but it was just done first by chance." So, does that mean more remakes are on the way? Torishima probed Horii, who simply repeated the same words, laughing.</p>
<p>Torishima continues to rock the boat a little bit by saying "It's like it does not mean that they are not doing 4-5-6", but again, Horii repeatedly denies, saying "I didn't say it" three times.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Horii starts talking about the remake — and the Zenithian Trilogy — to MC Naz Chris. "As I said just now, we want to make them playable on ongoing platforms", he tells her. And in response to her question about VII Reimagined "progressing smoothly?," Horii says the team has "a lot of progress" already.</p>
<p>But, like Torishima, Naz Chris can't help but give a little nudge, suggesting that Dragon Quest IV might "be taking more time" because of its "chapter divisions". Horii laughs in response.</p>
<p>It's definitely an odd choice to hop straight to VII after doing I &amp; II, but hey, we're happy to see the Dragon Quest series get some extra love on Switch and Switch 2. We do hope to see Dragon Quest XII in the near future, though...</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-closer-look">Square Enix posted a detailed blog</a> about many of the game's visual updates and changes, along with combat, character, and story details.</p>

<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158947/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you asked me what sort of game genre I think makes the best use of the Lego brick-building format, I’m not sure I’d answer with a two-player co-op adventure game. But here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-voyagers">LEGO Voyagers</a>, a touching co-op title from Light Brick Studio (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_builders_journey">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>) that uses the brick-based gameplay to send you and another player on a small adventure.</p>
<p>Voyagers is a hybrid between a platformer and a puzzle game, utilising a very simple control scheme. You pilot either a red brick or a blue brick that live together on an idyllic little Lego island, and after a mishap nearby, the two bricks set out on an adventure that takes them to some strange and scary new places.</p>
<p>It’s strictly two-player co-op, so you can’t play this alone, but you can either tackle it online with someone or in couch co-op. The latter is how I played the game, over a couple of evenings with my fiancée. If one of you owns the game, a second player can also download a free Friend’s Pass, so that’s something to keep in mind.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158950/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Voyagers’ gameplay and tone are very charming, and it’s all helped along with a gorgeous art style, which especially shines on Switch 2. While the protagonist bricks have one emotive little eye, the world itself uses realistic lighting to make those plastic platforms look almost realistic, albeit made entirely of Lego. Adding to the whimsy of the two main bricks you control, you can press 'Y' at any time to make a little grunt or noise, and it’s always adorable.</p>
<p>Upon setting off on your adventure, it’s clear that Lego Voyagers feels a bit clumsy to control. Instead of simply running around, you must roll your individual bricks, with all of the resistance that rolling a cuboid against steps and other bricks brings. It’s often a mission in and of itself getting your little brick to the right spot, and while rolling them around is fun, this resistance occasionally gets tiresome, especially when trying to reach difficult platforms.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s not just platforming, however, as the game's focus is on the different little islands or areas you encounter, and individual puzzles. Each chapter feels like its own diorama, and as you might expect from a Lego game, you and whoever you are playing with will be doing a lot of building.</p>

<p>Most puzzles involve you trying to get from A to B, and making either a bridge or some sort of steps to do so. It’s a concept that feels quite obvious, but is still really engaging. There’s just something so baseline enjoyable about putting Lego bricks together, especially when doing it with someone else.</p>
<p>To move bricks, you roll over to them and press 'A' to snap your red or blue brick onto them. Then, you roll over to your destination and press and hold 'A' again to assign a space for the other bricks. From this angle, you can quickly rotate bricks with 'X' and place them wherever you want.</p>
<p>This snapping onto bricks feels quite intuitive, and is essential to platforming as well, as later you must jump between ledges and use the snapping feature to move forward. It takes a while to understand, but it’s well executed. However, it doesn't always feel as tight as it should, and occasionally my partner had to hand her controller to me, as she couldn’t quite nail exactly what the platforming sections demanded.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158949/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, there are a few different types of puzzles, or ways to extend the ‘bridge-building’ concept a bit further, but ultimately, the game only has around two or three solutions you’ll ever need to find. Even when other things are littered around, the game mostly focuses on building a bridge or steps. This feels a bit disappointing, as with a two-player co-op title, I want the chance to communicate with the other player and solve a larger puzzle together.</p>
<p>Quite often, Voyager devolved into realising we had to build a bridge, and my partner just watching me do it because I found it easier to control. One puzzle involved moving a boat around to gather batteries, and the mixture of both players having to move the boat, and figure out the smaller puzzles around the batteries was a highlight, but a high that was all too rare.</p>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that Lego Voyagers is a ‘vibes’ game, as between the gorgeous visuals and the beautifully propulsive synth-led soundtrack, you’re probably just meant to experience this game together and enjoy the ride. We certainly did enjoy the ride, but compared to the constant ingenious puzzle-solving and essential communication of titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Voyagers often left us silent, waiting for one person to do what clearly needed to be done.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158951/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of the gameplay itself, the visual language of the game is often confusing, too. On the main menu, it is almost impossible to tell what option you’re picking, as the selected text just goes a slightly different shade of white. Then, in the game, there’s quite a lot of screen shake that made both of us occasionally feel unwell. And that extremely bright lighting gives an overly washed-out look, which also meant that often we found it really hard to tell either where our bricks were or which bricks we could use to move forward.</p>
<p>There is a really lovely game here, but before you spend £19.99/$24.99, be aware that this is around a four or five-hour game maximum, and two or three at minimum.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I adored Lego Voyagers' visual style and emotive design of the main bricks, I often found the actual puzzles underwhelming, and the game ended just as they started to get interesting.</p>
<p>If you ever find this on sale and want to just enjoy an evening with someone, this is a clever little co-op adventure with surprisingly touching themes. But when it comes to the difficulty of the main puzzles and the amount of content on offer, Lego Voyagers feels a few bricks short of a full set.</p></section>
