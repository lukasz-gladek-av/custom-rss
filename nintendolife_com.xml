<p>We're so close, in fact, that the reviews have started rolling in, and it's a pretty positive picture. Here at Nintendo Life, we had a wonderful time with FFVII, calling it "one of the best Switch 2 ports so far" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the whole thing, so you can read Alana's thoughts in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are caveats like 30fps, softer screen resolution, and some fuzzy textures. But Square Enix has clearly put the time and effort in here to ensure the best possible result, and with the Episode INTERMission DLC included as standard too, this might be the definitive way to play Remake on the go</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on the latest Square Enix joint! Below, we have rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to try and give you a better idea of the full range of opinions on display. Spoilers, we were not alone in our admiration.</p>
<p>Right at the top of the pile is <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2/">CGMagazine</a>, where the outlet scored FFVII a 9.5/10 on Switch 2, praising how the title showcases the console's technical chops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’ve been holding off from playing <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> all this time because you don’t have a PS5 or gaming PC, the Switch 2 port is practically a must-play</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://rpgamer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">RPGamer</a> came in with a 4.5/5 review, arguing that the title "fits wonderfully onto the Switch 2":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a huge amount to enjoy about the game, be it the exciting combat, impressive presentation, highly endearing cast, fascinating adjustments to the original tale, or detailed realisation of Midgar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Staying in the same camp, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/review/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Comicbook.com</a> gave the game a 4.5/5, particularly calling out the "absolute bargain" price as a major pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> remains $39.99 on the Switch 2 as it has been for PS5 and PC. And for the hours of solid action RPG combat it offers, that’s an absolute bargain in today’s market</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a> kept the good times going in its 4.5/5 review, praising the progression streamlining and Switch 2's HDR prowess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy Remake 7 Intergrade is one of the best-looking games on the Switch 2 to date, with an incredible port that compromises on very little to deliver a fantastic version of an already stunning game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, things dropped <em>ever so slightly</em> for <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Nintendo Insider</a>'s 8/10 review, which shared many of the positives outlined above, but still felt that the major story beats are a little lacking in this first part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can strongly recommend it, albeit with the caveat that you aren’t going to get any meaningful plot resolution within this part of the overall story. If you’re okay with that, then all I can say is… let’s mosey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All seems very consistent (and rather unsurprising), right? At the time of writing, the Switch 2 version is sitting with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score of 90 based on 24 reviews. We're sure more takes will roll in over the coming days, but for now, it seems, good game is still good.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade arrives on Switch 2 tomorrow, 22nd January 2025.</p>

<p>It's a beast</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you happen to be lucky enough to own a Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, then chances are you've had to do a little rearranging just to get them all to fit correctly underneath (or to the side of) your TV.</p>
<p>Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz">Xiao Ningzi</a> has come up with a rather novel – and surprisingly elegant – solution, by combining all three consoles into one giant machine. The result is pretty cool, albeit not one that we'd be in a rush to emulate anytime soon.</p>
<p>Essentially, with a simple press of a button, the 'Ningtendo PXbox 5', as it's been christened, can switch between all three consoles at will. You might be wondering how it works with docking the Switch 2, and this is done by sliding the console into the side of the device, with a red eject button used to pop it back out. The downside to this is that it has to go in sideways, which is a little concerning, but if the vents are kept clear, that's the main thing, right?</p>
<p>Switching between each console takes mere seconds, though we remain unconvinced that it would stay cool enough to keep everything safe and in good working order. Still, it's a fun little experiment, and we applaud the process Ningzi went through to get everything done.</p>
