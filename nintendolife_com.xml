<p>Now, for those unaware, and to get things off in a high-brow sort of way through the illusion of learning, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet, now the country's national poet no less, who lived from 1759 until 1796. Just 37 years. However! In this tragically short lifespan, he managed to imprint himself permanently on the Scottish psyche through his powerful works which contributed greatly to the Romantic movement, don't you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="CiNQNWrXoic" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytCiNQNWrXoic" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed82b568twjvgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The fact that Burns wrote in a Scots dialect (although he did use a watered-down version, making his verses and lyrics much easier to parse for non-native speakers) made him incredibly popular and personal to the Scots, and in death he's become a figure of inspiration for socialist and liberal movements, in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, we probably all know <strong>Auld Lang Syne</strong>, his poem which became lyrics sung on New Year's Eve to "ring in the bells" as folk say up here in Scotland (they kidnapped me in 2007 and made me live here, please help). But other works — and we're getting to the end of the learning bit now, class, so stay strong — include very well-known stuff like <strong>A Red, Red Rose</strong> and <strong>Tam o' Shanter</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b9ab63965a8a5"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b9ab63965a8a5/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, Tam o' Shanter. That's right. If this rings a bell, gamers, it's because back in 2010 Nintendo helped celebrate Burns Night with a special Animal Crossing item. Burns Night — which happens every 25th January (Burns' birthday) and which I'm currently enjoying immensely, thank you — sees some folk in Scotland read and/or perform from a selection of the poets' works, eat lots of haggis, neeps and tatties (that's turnip and potatoes to you), and, well, some people may even like to have small thimble of whiskey, too. Then straight to bed!</p>
<p>If you happened to have been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/animal_crossing_city_folk">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a>, or <strong>Animal Crossing: Let's Go To The City</strong> as it was known o'er here — sorry, went all Burns there — back in 2010, you'll have got to celebrate your very own Burn's Night by nabbing a very exciting (mild sarcasm detected) "Tam o' Shanter" hat. Aye, a wee Scottish tartan bonnet for putting oan the in-game heid eh a bonnie wee lad/and or lassie. (Apologies to all my Scottish friends for that sentence.)</p>
<p>The coolest thing about this particular hat, as you'll no doubt already know, was that it gave your character a shaggy new Scottish hairdo as an extra to boot, and this celebration of Scotland's national bard has also gone on to feature in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> (hey, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">just got an update!</a>).</p>
<p>So, seeing as it's Burns Night and all that, and seeing how I'm currently in Glasgow, the unofficial capital of Scotland, why not join me, in...well...it's not exactly the same as raising a glass to the great man, but why not hop into your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (or New Leaf), stick yer hat oan, and join me in some deep breathing exercises as we consider Robert Burns, and his many, many excellent poems. But most especially Tam o' Shanter, as it's the one holding this vaguely game-related article together.</p>
<p>With me? Right! Can't find your Tam o' Shanter? To nab the headgear in New Horizons, you need to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-gulliver-souvenir-list-how-to-wake-up-where-to-find-communicator-parts">get it from Gulliver as a reward for helping him find his communicator parts</a>. No worries, you can just jump into the game's custom designs portal to look for (or design!) some Scottish and tartan-themed gear. If you're wondering, you got the hat from Pelly or Phyllis at the Post Office in New Leaf.</p>

<p>Once you've got your hat on, and have your plate of haggis (that's sheep liver, lungs, heart, etcetera, all mixed up with delicious oatmeal, or there's a veggie option available!), grab yourself a thimble of something delicious and we'll offer up a toast to Rabbie Burns, and to Animal Crossing, I guess, on this latest Burns Night.</p>
<p>And to close out, here's a little excerpt from Tam o' Shanter, in which we contemplate the transient nature of joy, man's inability to control time, and the nature of mortality. Annnnnnnd relax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br>
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br>
Or like the snow-falls in the river,<br>
A moment white–then melts forever . . .<br>
. . .<br>
Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br>
Evanishing amid the storm.–<br>
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br>
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br>
That hour o' night's black arch the key-stane,<br>
That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in;<br>
And sic a night he taks the road in,<br>
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm off over to Wikipedia to get this Animal Crossing malarkey added to the site's official list of cultural references for Robert Burns.</p>
<p>Gabh cùram!</p>

<figure data-uuid="cedc5f3abce7c"><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cedc5f3abce7c/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back, lovely people, to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>! We're still in the first weeks of a new year, and we can all now officially confirm that it's...another year. Hmm.</p>
<p>Enough <em>dwelling</em> - there's more than enough of that to do when you click elsewhere on the web. Let's talk video games, shall we? Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month, we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So, let's see what you've got to say...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - January 2026</h2>
<h3>"[redacted] for his birfday" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I still don't have a Switch 2. I totally want one, but they're SO expensive (living in Japan but playing games from all over the world I'll have to buy the extra expensive "international" version, not to mention a new gigantic SD card since I'm 100% digital, a new Pro controller, etc.). And according to my spreadsheet, I've completed 85 out of 148 or so games on my Switch. I'd love to play fancy new games (or upgrades to older games) on Switch 2, but I'm not exactly in a hurry. In fact, when it was originally released I decided that I'd wait until fancy new colors or an even fancier limited edition of some sort got released.</p>
<p>Well, fancy new colors got released this week, and I absolutely love them. But... it's not a set, and buying a Switch 2 plus extra Joy Cons goes back to my initial complaint.</p>
<p>So like, how much longer do you think I should wait?? My son is demanding that I buy him [redacted] for his birfday, but out of spite I refuse to put that thing on my Switch, so I'd rather buy a Switch 2 and let him have my original to do with as he pleases. Yes, I know, I'm a terrible father. His birfday is approaching very rapidly, though, so I kind of want to use him as an excuse to just take the expensive plunge, but if I DO buy a Switch 2 and a day later Nintendo announces a limited edition Xenoblade 4 Switch 2 I'll never forgive him because obviously it will be his fault. To summarize concisely: Me want buy fancy non-standard Switch 2 but when is happen you think does???<strong><br>
Kurt Asbestos</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, excuses-wise, it definitely won't be getting cheaper anytime soon - and there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">a good chance the price will go up</a>. Given the global challenges around production and distribution on top of the general economic strife, Nintendo won't be in a rush to put out the inevitable upgraded version, either.</p>
<p>Personally? I don't see them doing some crazy variant for a while. They might put a Triforce on it or something, but I can't imagine them doing a white one (for example) until they've got at least another holiday season ticked off. It would just anger recent adopters still stinging from the hole in their wallet.</p>
<p>Seriously, what monster contemplates putting a Light Purple Joy-Con into a non-matching Light Blue mag slot anyway? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"2026 has started"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2026 has started (by the time of the next reader letters issue) and I have 3 Nintendo predictions for the year:</p>
<p>1. Tomodatchi Life Living the Dream gets a direct.<br>
2. The 40th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda isn't too big of a deal with Zelda news being saved for later in the year for the lead up to the Zelda movie.<br>
3. Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow (and maybe Gold, Silver and Crystal) finally get a Switch release that is much more confusing and annoying than just adding it to Game Boy Nintendo Classics or selling them (be it an NSO price hike around the same time, a 3rd tier of NSO or some other new annoyance).<br>
<strong><em>Aidan</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> will also be available on Nintendo Switch, and the <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> special DLC pack — <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2! - Dazzling Crystal</em> — will be available for both platforms later in the year. Pre-orders will open after this broadcast and come with a limited-time bonus: the original <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> for Nintendo Game Boy, available exclusively with this DLC set until February 27th, 2027. Please look forward to future announcements." <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"'more serious' platforms"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are all the new colour variations for the Joy-Con 2?! You know times are strange when 'more serious' platforms like the PlayStation and Xbox are churning out different controllers on a quarterly basis, whilst Nintendo leave us in the dark with the boring grey duo... Same for the Pro Controller 2! I'd personally love to see some colours pay homage to the NGC; Indigo, Platinum, and Orange, with coloured buttons to boot!<br>
<strong><em>Moochy</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they are, Moochy! No sooner had you sent this than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">Nintendo announced a new boring grey duo</a> with pastel accents.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind seeing some more interesting colours, but I'd be happy if we could just get through the generation without drift.</p>
<p>Oh, and 'Orange' is so vulgar; it's <em>Spice</em>, darling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"whip out something ridiculous"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there NL gang,</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that with every Switch 2 Edition Nintendo conjures, there is a unwritten rule that each title must be longer than the other!</p>
<p>*Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV*<br>
*Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World*<br>
And god forbid... *Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabell Park.*<br>
I mean, seriously though, where *do* you draw the line when it comes to something like this? Does Nintendo even care if we need to take a breath midway through announcing them?!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now, those three games above _are_ fairly lengthy titles in their own right.<br>
So I think we're safe... and of course now that I've said that, they'll whip out something ridiculous like *Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition = Lubba's Fury* ...There's just no escaping it!<strong><br>
Nintoz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has become an office joke around these parts. They start to look like equations if you stare at them long enough. 'Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Bowser Jr.'s Big Bash', anyone? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"great plastic"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Nintendolife!</p>
<p>I’m a big Zelda fan and I love collecting items from the series. Unfortunately, Nintendo hasn’t released new amiibo for quite some time, despite there being so many interesting characters that could be made into these great plastic figurines.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I’d like to leave you an idea for a poll on the site...<br>
<strong>Franc001</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, let's do it. (The Mineru's Contruct amiibo is still to come, remember.)</p>

<p>Not a bad selection! A comically enormous Deku Tree amiibo would make me grin, but I'd like a Sprout, too. And a Mido. And a Deku Scrub. An... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>It's really cheesy, and not the good kind of cheese." - <strong>L27</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All kinds of cheeses are good, my friend. Except that Wensleydale with the fruit in it. Horrific idea. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>it's probably a steaming pile of dung." - <strong>WoomyNNYes</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, if it looks like dung, and smells like dung, and tastes like...</p>
<p>Oof, probably should have stopped after the first two, in hindsight. Anyone got a Tic Tac? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Has research been conducted on this?" - <strong>Davis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surrounded by people in lab coats brandishing clipboards as we speak. Several of them are wearing glasses. Spared no expense. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

<p>We went tactical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift-ds">last week</a>, as we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> on the DS, and it's got to be said, the results were the most one-sided we've seen in a long time. The bright European / Japanese version took home a staggering 90% of the vote, leaving the bland North American variant with a measly 10%. <em>Oof</em>.</p>
<p>With a new Yoshi game on the horizon, we're throwing it back to one of the delightful dino's most beloved entries (in the handheld space, at least), as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>. Those with a good memory might remember us tackling the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/poll_box_art_brawl_duel_55_-_super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">SNES original</a> way back in 2020, but the GBA version comes with a pair of covers all of its own, so let's take a look at them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fptjvwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0d7b39a2a9d7d"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d7b39a2a9d7d/sma-yoshis-island-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European and North American cover will be instantly familiar to those who remember the SNES layout. It sees Yoshi and Baby Mario merrily making their way across the island as a giant Nep-Enut emerges from the water behind them. It's clean, it's colourful, it's iconic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="3d1c930803cc2"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d1c930803cc2/sma-yoshis-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flipside, the Japanese design opts for something far less level-based. Baby Mario and Yoshi still take centre stage, but they are instead surrounded by a bunch of other Yoshis, all decked out in different pastel colours to stress the multiplayer potential. The pink background might not tell you quite as much about a typical level structure as the NA/EU cover, but it is really rather cute.</p>
