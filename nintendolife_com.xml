<p>Former Bethesda dev had battled cancer</p>

<figure><a title="Julian LeFay Passes away" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/203374220c1e6/julian-lefay-passes-away.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OnceLost</em></figcaption></figure><p>Julian LeFay, the man often referred to as "the father of the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>" and co-founder of the indie developer OnceLost Studio, has passed away after a years-long battle with cancer. The announcement was made by his studio earlier today on social media. He was 59 years old.</p>
<p>LeFay was instrumental in the early days of Bethesda's RPG history, back when the likes of <strong>Daggerfall</strong> was laying the foundations for what was to come from the studio in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/is-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Oblivion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Skyrim.</a></p>
<p>In the post, OnceLost said that he was "not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today."</p>

<p>LeFay numerous credits include programming lead on <strong>Arena</strong> and <strong>Battlespire</strong>, project lead on <strong>Daggerfall</strong>, as well as having credits on The Elder Scrolls Redguard and Morrowind.</p>
<p>He also worked as a composer and designer on games such as <strong>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</strong> (which came to NES) and music on the DOS <strong>Where's Wally?</strong> game.</p>
<p>LeFay's daughter also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1948048790986051982">shared a poignant statement</a>, saying "Thank you for supporting his vision and giving him hope and strength until the end".</p>
<p>The studio addressed how this tragedy will affect work on its upcoming RPG, The Wayward Realms, and it's quite emotional reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our thoughts are with LeFay's friends and family, and he will be missed by many in the industry.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nitrome's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> made a bit of a splash when it was revealed back around the Switch 2's launch, looking very much, as it does, a sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snipperclips_plus_cut_it_out_together">Snipperclips</a> for Switch 2 that utilises the console's neat mouse mode function.</p>
<p>Now, Nitrome has released a second trailer for their mouse-mode-centric effort, alongside a bunch of new info about the ins and outs of what you'll be doing as you play- when you do actually get to play, that is.</p>
<p>The new trailer takes us through three job types, and shows off the game's Job Centre. The jobs detailed are Hairdresser, Archer and Tour Guide, so this is definitely already a much more interesting job centre than the ones this writer remembers being harrowed by during the late 1990s.</p>

<p>We'll let Nitrome's press release fill you in on a little more of the finer points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In Hairdresser, you’ll work against the clock to give your hirsute customers the trim of their dreams. Click with your scissors to cut away at their hair, or use the razor to give them a close shave - and we couldn’t not add tweezers, right?</p><p>

Next up is Archer, where your aim will be put to the test. Hit all the targets as they fly past (quack), and don’t miss any, or else you’ll lose a life! Be sure not to hit your coworkers, too...</p></div>
<p>Tour Guide takes a fresh spin on a Nitrome classic - Hot Air! Propel your tourist through the stage to reach the goal, but be sure to visit landmarks along the way to take in the view and earn your tip. We’ve worked hard to ensure Tour Guide stays true to its roots (it was even programmed by one of the Hot Air series’ developers!)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
You can check out the trailer above for yourself, it's certainly looking like a whole bunch of fun, and this new glimpse also makes sure to highlight some important changes to the game's multiplayer.</p>
<p>"In Cargo Hauler, some crates will simply be too heavy to lift by a single mouse, or in IT Support, some popups will trap a player inside them - you’ll need a colleague to come over and close that popup before you can escape!"</p>
<p>Now, and on a slightly frustrating note, Nitrome, whilst fully ready to release by the looks and sounds of it, will have to wait to announce a release date for all this mouse-drive mayhem, as they have yet to receive a Switch 2 dev kit from the Big N.</p>
<div><p>As we reported on a while back, it seems that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">this is par for the course at this stage of a new console launch</a>, with indies that require extra grunt perhaps getting kits first. It still feels a bit odd that Nintendo aren't keen to make sure these sorts of titles, which big-up the new features of a new console, are first in line for kits, mind.</p><p>

As Nitrome puts it:</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Mouse Work’s release is dependant on Nitrome acquiring dev kits for Switch 2 which we do not yet have. That being said, we are working away to get Mouse Work as ready as possible so that when we do have one, we can release as soon as we can!<em><br></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll leave you with some fresh screenshots!</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to getting some new job experience when Mouse Work manages to release? Like the look of what you've seen of the game thus far? Make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>
