<figure data-uuid="f94d289e8ff53"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2 Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f94d289e8ff53/animal-crossing-switch-2-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices have been revealed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and its upgrade pack, and they are slightly lower than you might have expected.</p>
<p>As listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">Switch eShop</a>, the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is now available to pre-order for <strong>£54.99 / $64.99</strong>, while the upgrade pack is a measly <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Just in case the headline wasn't enough of a giveaway, that's the cheapest Switch 2 Edition we've seen from Nintendo.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> set you back £58.99 / $69.99 for the Switch 2 Edition or £7.99 / $9.99 for the upgrade path. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> were £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 on new hardware, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s upgrades were available for free to NSO subscribers, those who weren't signed up had to pay £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 for the full next gen experience.</p>
<p>In short, Animal Crossing is a fair bit cheaper than we would have initially expected. But then, when we think about it, perhaps we should have expected exactly this. ACNH makes for a nice Switch 2 package, with Mouse Mode integration, improved resolutions and GameChat features to boot, but the whole thing feels a little slight compared to other S2 upgrades, no?</p>
<p>The frame rate, for example, remains at 30fps — the first Switch 2 Edition to not contain a boost in this department. There's a fresh Megaphone item, but almost all of the new content is tied to the ver. 3.0 update, which is coming to Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Compare that to Kirby or Mario Party, where the upgrades contained new modes and levels, and the reduced price makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So, are we pleased that New Horizons isn't quite as expensive as the NS2 Editions that have come before it? Yes we are. But can we see why? Hmmm, probably.</p>
