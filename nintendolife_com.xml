<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system. It functions much closer to games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sims_4">The Sims</a> and allows you to completely change the size and shape of buildings by adding and moving walls, doors, windows, and roofs as well as all the usual interior decorations."</p>

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>

<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>
