<figure data-uuid="dbf01f2788a01"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf01f2788a01/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't already got a Switch 2 and happen to be located in the US, the bundle deal including a digital copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has gone on sale for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>This bundle deal is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy for <strong>$449</strong> instead of $499, so you're saving $50. This is the first time the bundle has been on sale in this location and basically gives you access to the new entry in the Mario Kart series at no extra cost (instead of forking out extra).</p>
<p>A regular Switch 2 bundle is normally priced at $449, so this current offer on the Mario Kart World bundle brings it down to the same price. Nintendo also previously mentioned how the Mario World Bundle would be a "limited time product" through to Fall 2025 in the US and is available "while supplies last".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has only recently passed the six-month mark in its life, and Nintendo has not officially discounted or reduced the price of the new unit.</p>

<p>Well that was fast</p>

<figure data-uuid="1122ece876094"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1122ece876094/sonic-the-hedgehog-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Paramount Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Paramount has revealed some of its future movie plans, but for us, the biggest draw is that Sonic the Hedgehog will be getting a brand new spin-off movie in 2028.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a> reports that this upcoming spin-off is currently untitled, but it's being referred to to as the "Sonic Universe Event Film". It will launch in cinemas on <strong>22nd December 2028</strong>. More than three years away!</p>
<p>Note that this <em>isn't</em> the planned Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, which is coming out in <strong>March 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>We have no other details right now, but there are a lot of opportunities to branch out in the Sonic universe, with tons of untapped characters and other video games the movies can draw from.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like a no-brainer to expand the Sonic movie universe — the first three films have all received warm critical reception, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie">particularly Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, and fans seem to absolutely love them.</p>
<p>Collectively, the franchise has made over $1 billion at the box office and spawned a TV show focusing on Knuckles the Echidna, so more movies surely means more money.</p>
<p>We at least have some idea of who will feature in the Sonic 4 movie, so we'll have to excitedly wait and see on what the Sonic Universe movie will bring.</p>
