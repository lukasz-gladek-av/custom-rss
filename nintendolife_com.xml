<p>This time around, however, it's all about bug fixes (haaa...) and tweaks to Tools. Sharing the details on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">Steam</a>, the developer has detailed what these entail, with many of them focusing on enemies accidentally going out-of-bounds and certain Tools not doing the right amount of damage or not working as intended.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067upjkyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While fans should "Expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release", for now, it looks like this patch will be forgoing any more difficulty tweaks. That's not to say Team Cherry won't add any more later down the line, of course, but for now, things are staying as they are.</p>
<p>Currently, there's not a release date for the patch, but we imagine it'll drop in the next week or two.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">current patch notes</a>:</p>

<p>A second chapter</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Joshua Bright" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e186a127c442/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-joshua-bright.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: GungHo Online</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it looks like <strong>Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</strong> is absolutely happening, as a teaser that appears at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> has been doing the rounds online.</p>
<p>Shared on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Reddit</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-confirmed-could-release-a-lot-sooner-than-people-think">Push Square</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>), the teaser is hidden within the upcoming remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, which launches on Switch and Switch 2 this Friday, 19th September 2025.</p>
<p>If we had to guess, the teaser probably plays you've rolled credits. And for good reason; there are some pretty big 1st Chapter spoilers there.</p>
<p>We're not going to pop the video here, and we recommend you only watch it if you've played Trails in the Sky on PSP or PC before (and/or SC) or you don't care for spoilers, but if you're curious, go check out the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Falcom subreddit</a>. Instead, have a look at last week's combat trailer to give you a little tease of the remake:</p>

<p>This shouldn't be surprising news, and we're sure Falcom will announce something once 1st Chapter releases, but Falcom president <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">Toshihiro Kondo has already hinted at the sequel's existence</a> just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>While we wait for some more official news, you can check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/video-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-dlc-overview-trailer-released">what DLC packs are coming to the upcoming 1st Chapter</a> or consider the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-confirmed">recently-announced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
