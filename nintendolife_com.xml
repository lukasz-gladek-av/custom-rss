<p>Kicking off later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, it really is here — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, the soccer RPG from Level-5 which has seen multiple delays and <em>two</em> name changes, finally launches on 13th November 2025 on Switch and Switch 2. And ahead of that day, the developer has shared the first 30 minutes of the game's story mode.</p>
<p>The footage (above) is from the game's Story Mode, and as you can see, it's <em>very</em> story-heavy. There's not even any footie. But there's plenty to do as you explore the grounds of the school for the very first time.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the early highlights are the gorgeous animated cutscenes from MAPPA, the animation studio best known for its work on <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> Season 4, <strong>Vinland Saga</strong> Season 2, and <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.</p>
<p>You might have seen that some people are already playing the game online; that's because pre-orders for the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions of the game grant Early Access to the game. That's <em>not</em> the case on Switch 1 or 2, unfortunately. So we'll have to wait until Thursday for a kickabout...</p>

<p>You might also be wondering about official reviews, too. We'll echo the words our sister site Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/site-news-wheres-our-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-ps5-ps4-review">shared yesterday</a>: we don't have a pre-release code.</p>
<p>And, as we'll be reviewing the Switch 2 version — which has Mouse Mode, along with better performance and visuals and other features — we also don't have access to... early access, so we won't be able to make a start until we get a code or until the game's officially out.</p>
<p>So, basically, we'll have a review for you as soon as we can, but as you're likely aware, this game is <em>massive</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1904a2299f646"><a title="romancing saga 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1904a2299f646/romancing-saga-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think it's fair to say we got a bit of an unexpected gift when Square Enix re-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">Romancing SaGa 3</a> for Switch back in November of 2019.</p>
<p>While it may not generate quite the same level of excitement as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasies</a> (and that's understandable), Romancing SaGa 3 deserves any plaudits it gets for bringing a level of freedom and randomness to the RPG genre that was quite unique back in 1995. In fact, the whole series does.</p>
<p>With 3 in particular, we have a game that was bold, and still feels bold, in how it gave players a selection of eight protagonists to get stuck into the story with. Just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and its (much better) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">sequel</a>, you can journey through Romancing SaGa 3's narrative multiple times thanks to the clever, criss-crossing storylines that make for a genuinely engrossing experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vtuwko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>It helps that the actual story here is fairly strong as these things go to boot, with players assuming control of their chosen protagonist in the immediate aftermath of a Death Eclipse (or Morastrum), a horrifying event that occurs every 300 years that sees all newborns in the year of the Eclipse die, save for one, who becomes a Child of Destiny.</p>
<p>Right, I didn't come here to spoil the story, so that's enough of that. It's a cracker of a premise, and the game does a solid job of exploring it. Back in 1995, RPGs were very much still on-rails for the most part; they didn't allow for much in the way of "experimentation" in some of the ways that Romancing SaGa 3 does.</p>
<p>And it's experimentation that comes through allowing you to choose who to roll with, leading to events playing out from shifting perspectives, whilst also imbuing the whole endeavour with a striking sort of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laissez-faire">'laissez-faire'</a> attitude, thanks to levelling up systems that sort of just go "yeah, mate, eh...here, have some random boosts for your efforts." In true SaGa style.</p>

<p>Rather than being able to count on a fixed upgrade rate to any specific aspect of your character, here it's random all the way, and it feels great. There's a ramshackle sort of approach...perhaps ramshackle isn't quite the correct word as it feels organised, but there's certainly an attempt - and a successful one - to make things feel <em>organic</em>, to make the world feel like one you can inhabit and meander around in, rather than just blowing through in a straight, precise and calculated manner. So, maybe it allows <em>you</em> to approach <em>it</em> in a ramshackle manner is a more appropriate description.</p>
<p>The weapon "sparking" system (returning from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_2">Romancing SaGa 2</a>) continues this approach, which gives each of the characters the chance to gain new skills randomly as they fight. Whilst some players may not gel entirely with this I personally love it, and I think it's a system that enhances the organic vibe in a smart way, whilst also ensuring that you still upgrade and progress.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do agree it probably works to the detriment of the overall focus of the gameplay loops, and that's something picked up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">in our 6/10 review</a> of the re-release. It can be frustrating and off-putting if you want to methodically improve and do the usual sort of RPG things with character progression. For me, though, it's successful in what it sets out to do with being a little bit free-wheeling, that the loss of some direction in the more traditional video game sense is acceptable.</p>
<p>I also love how the underlying ethos of all of this is carried into Kenjo Ito's soundtrack for the game. Again here, rather than have a plan or specific theme in mind, the composer approached it with the idea of allowing its sound to develop and evolve over time. It's all very zen, lads.</p>
<p>Have a happy birthday, Romancing SaGa 3. I'd ask you if you'd planned anything, but I don't see that being your style.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roguelike 'Wizard Of Legend 2' Magics Up Switch Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/roguelike-wizard-of-legend-2-magics-up-switch-release-date</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>After its launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox earlier this year, Dead Mage and Humble Games have announced that the magic roguelike sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend_2">Wizard of Legend 2</a>, will be appearing on Switch on <strong>25th November</strong> (from a puff of smoke, presumably).</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, Wizard of Legend 2 will see you building magical loadouts from a wide range of elemental arcana, and casting spells to take out waves of enemies, navigate elemental hazards and tackle bosses.</p>
<p>All this can be played alone or with three friends in local or online co-op, and the dev promises "refined controls for Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, and optimised performance across both handheld and docked play" in this Switch version.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Humble Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4-player Co-op:</strong> Play solo or with up to three friends in seamless online or local multiplayer. The Switch release incorporates refinements introduced during 1.0, including faster Arcana responsiveness, improved camera tracking, adjusted boss HP scaling, and streamlined item interactions for smoother co-op runs.<br>
<strong>Diverse Biomes and Bosses:</strong> Each region presents new elemental hazards, enemy archetypes, minibosses, and area bosses. From the heights of the Sky Citadel to the depths of the Chaos biome, every area features distinct mechanics and rewards for players to uncover.<br>
<strong>Elemental Arcana System:</strong> Experiment with 77 Arcana spanning Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Chaos elements. Mix and match to discover synergies, from chain lightning combos to earth-based crowd control, and adapt your spell kit to each Trial’s demands.<br>
<strong>Expansive Language Support:</strong> Support in 13 languages, including English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Persian, and Turkish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend">The first game</a>, developed by Contingent99 launched to much acclaim back in 2018, quickly racking up thousands of '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/">Steam</a>. With Dead Mage now in the dev seat, its sequel has not been as well-received since it first launched in ver. 1.0, though the promise of playing on the go might be enough to bring some people around to the idea.</p>
