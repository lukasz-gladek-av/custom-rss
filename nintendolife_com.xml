<p>The ver. 1.4.0 patch is now live on Switch and Switch 2, introducing two new cherry blossom-themed gliders (the 'Ceremonial Glider' and 'Leaf Glider') alongside new deluxe bingo cards, bonus hair and eye colour options, and a couple of other tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>It's far from the biggest update we've seen from Grand Bazaar to date, but it's nice to see Marvelous' support extending into 2026.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytylLGp-DIVlY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436jyqhgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it launched on Switch and Switch 2 last year, calling it "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep expanding it"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka has been pretty open about his aspirations to expand upon the game with DLC, but thanks to a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WeebyNewz">Weeby Newz</a> on YouTube, we now have a better idea of just how far he's willing to go.</p>
<p>When asked about what he might be interested in exploring with additional DLC regarding new routes and endings, Kodaka states that he wants to keep growing The Hundred Line for "around ten years", citing the seemingly unlimited potential to tell new stories.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the game already includes so many genres such as the Romance Route and the S.F. Route, it means we can add almost any kind of story. I'd like to keep expanding it into like 200 lines, 300 lines, or even 400 lines – as many routes as we can imagine, a game people have never seen before.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, I'd love for it to grow into something that can keep going for around ten years."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on to tease the possibility of new characters, stating that "depending on the route, I think we can introduce new transfer students".</p>
<p>It does, however, sound like we'll be waiting a little while before we see any DLC expansions. Although Kodaka states that the team is working through ideas daily, he stresses that it's "not something that's fully in motion yet".</p>
<p>Still, this is all very exciting, indeed. We gave The Hundred Line a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">our review</a> last year, calling it "an excellent tactical RPG that fully showcases the strengths of the creatives behind it". If you've yet to play it, we'd urge you to give it a shot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Reveals Save Data Bonuses For Its New HD-2D Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/square-enix-reveals-save-data-bonuses-for-its-new-hd-2d-game</link>
            <guid>1431922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> locked in a June release last week, and alongside this news, the team has also revealed multiple save data bonuses if you own certain other Square Enix titles.</p>
<p>As long as you've got existing save data (or for certain platforms, purchase history on the same player account), you should be able to unlock these bonuses. It's noted how demo save data for titles "may also fulfill the bonus eligibility requirements".</p>
<p>The save data eligible includes saves from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/various_daylife">Various Daylife</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a>. Here's the full rundown from Square Enix's official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Guidance of the Sacred Flame" - Increases sword damage dealt to enemies with 30% or lower vitality by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Critical Hit" - Increases sword critical-hit rate by 6%."</p>
<p><strong>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Brave" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10%. Uses a little more shield stamina when guarding."</p>
<p><strong>VARIOUS DAYLIFE</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Expeditionary Wisdom" - Reduces sword charge time by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>TRIANGLE STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Counter Stance" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10% while shield stamina is 90% or greater."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Square Enix further note how save data for an "eligible title" must be on the same Switch 2 console. And if you're playing the game on Switch 2, and the applicable data is on an original Switch system, that data must be transferred to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>These save data bonuses can apparently be claimed at "any time", even if the save data for one of these titles is created <em>after</em> starting the Adventures of Elliot. As for the length of this promotion, it's taking place at the time of "release" but this does not guarantee it will be a permanent distribution or service, according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's how you can claim these items in-game when it launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>18th June 2026</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to claim the bonus items:</strong></p>
<p>- Select the Promotional Bonus option from The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales’ title screen and link with any corresponding titles.</p>
<p>- Linking occurs automatically by opening the relevant screen.</p>
<p>- After starting a new game, examine the desk on the second floor of the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping.</p>
<p>- Select Claim bonuses from the menu options to claim the qualifying bonuses from the list.</p>
<p>- Please note that bonuses cannot be claimed at certain points in the game when the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping becomes temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p><em>- Departure Brooch - Increases the amount of tul (in-game currency) and magicite fragments dropped by enemies by a little</em></p>

<p>Oh, and it's got one other game planned for 2026</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee576a7524a55"><a title="Romeo Is A Dead Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee576a7524a55/romeo-is-a-dead-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Grasshopper Manufacture</em></figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture, the developer known for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/no_more_heroes">No More Heroes</a> series, launches its new game <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a></strong> on multiple platforms today, but this doesn't include Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>If you have been wondering about the chances of this new title getting a Switch release, we've got another update. During a special five-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/f_PObigha-w">'Grasshopper Direct' broadcast</a> earlier on, company CEO Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) reiterated how the team is doing what it can to make a "Switch 2 version" happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're doing what we can to make it happen, so again, please give us a little more time."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually follows a comment Suda51 made last December, mentioning how the team wanted to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/">bring the game to the Switch 2</a> but needed to make sure Unreal Engine 5 was "going to play nicely" with the new hybrid system, so it was testing everything out.</p>
<p>This update today also followed the news that Grasshopper is currently in talks with multiple parties about a "physical version" of the title.</p>
<p>And in one other surprising piece of news shared by Suda, it's been revealed the developer is "almost 100% certain" it will be releasing "one more game" in 2026. As for the details about this new project, the team can't reveal any information just yet, but another announcement should take place "soon".</p>
