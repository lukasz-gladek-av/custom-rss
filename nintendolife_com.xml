<p>Starting the Switch 2 Edition in style</p>

<figure data-uuid="f8804591966af"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8804591966af/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Team Cherry surprised us all with the shadow drop release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (at least, it would have been a surprise if its PEGI rating hadn't cropped up online before), and the studio snuck out a new update to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.5.12459 update isn't packed with game-changing additions, but it's always nice to see Team Cherry fine-tuning the experience. Alongside new screen resolution support for PC players, the patch also introduces "many under-the-hood improvements brought over from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> to the original game," Team Cherry said in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollowknightupgraded">blog post</a>. And yes, this update is available on both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared in an announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/526493182068785899">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Hollow Knight ver. 1.5.12459 (Released 5th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br>
- Salubra's Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.<br>
- Map panning is now smoother.<br>
- Various performance improvements.<br>
- Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight boasts improved resolution, frame rate, and a handful of additional effects, with a new 120fps option to boot. We've added our thoughts about the new release to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a> below, saying, "Honestly, if you haven't played Hollow Knight, the Switch 2 Edition is a no-brainer".</p>

Just like clockwork, one day on, the company has shared an infographic summarising every game that featured.</p>
<p>While it might not have been a presentation of wall-to-wall bangers, there is something quite nice about seeing every game in one image, no? Sure, the biggies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> immediately draw the eye, but a closer look reminds us that the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> also made an appearance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wlpvng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo shared the image across its social channels, helpfully splitting the announcements up into Switch 2, Switch 2 / 1 and Switch 1 releases, so you can see what's coming up, regardless of which console you own. Here's a closer look at the graphic itself:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f74f5d9845519"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase - Feb 2026" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74f5d9845519/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-feb-2026.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUajL7qjgI5/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'd say that it's not a bad line-up, all in all. Perhaps not the most surprise-packed Direct in recent memory, but there's no denying that the 2026 release calendar is looking particularly stacked for Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Hollow Knight (Switch) - One Of The Finest Metroidvanias That's Not A Metroid Or 'Vania]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>This review was originally published in June 2018 when Hollow Knight launched on the Switch 1. To celebrate the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, we're republishing it along with some brief impressions of the free upgrade, which is available to download now.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Switch isn't exactly lacking for quirky <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-metroidvania-games">Metroidvanias</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yokus_island_express">Yoku's Island Express</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dandara">Dandara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/steamworld_dig_2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a> all stretching the genre in new and interesting directions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, though, is arguably the most striking of the lot. Team Cherry's platform-adventure has long been awaited by Switch owners in the know. The game has attracted considerable buzz — and no small amount of fan art — since its PC debut last year. Now Hollow Knight has taken its console bow, and it doesn't disappoint.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/90228/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>You take control of the titular knight, a tiny bug warrior in an insectoid world gone to seed. The art style might be cartoony, but this is a surprisingly mournful setting from the off. The once-mighty kingdom of Hallownest has crumbled, its communities either abandoned or driven mad. All but a few lingering eccentrics have disappeared into the ground, drawn downwards by a mysterious miasma.</p>
<p>It's a beautifully melancholic canvas onto which you must gradually paint in the details. In time-honoured Metroidvania fashion, that involves venturing into the unknown to map out the world, conquering lumbering bosses, and expanding your ability set so that you can access new areas.</p>
<p>Structurally, then, Hollow Knight doesn't offer much that's new, but it's in the execution that it really shines. At the core of the game is a crunchy sword-and-magic combat system. Our knight might carry a so-called 'needle', but this spindly blade lands with a heck of a thwack. The recoil from each hit sends both you and your enemy back a little, which is both empowering and potentially endangering — particularly when battle takes place in the midst of a precarious platforming section.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the movement system is just as tight. Whether you're using the left Joy-Con stick or the D-pad on the Switch Pro Controller, our hero responds beautifully. It's no great spoiler to reveal that one of the first abilities you acquire is a dash, and this quickly becomes a staple part of your calculations throughout your adventure. It grants you extra speed on the floor and additional range and manoeuvrability in mid-air.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/2208/embed @ 1770396298 -->
<p>Your magical abilities are fuelled by a smart system that feeds on the souls of defeated enemies. Given that your knight's first magical ability is to heal himself, it means that the best form of defence really is attack in Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Not that you can afford to be too gung-ho about your business. This is a challenging game, with many of the regular grunts employing unorthodox movements and lightning-quick attacks to cause you headaches, particularly in combination. The bosses, meanwhile, will have you failing repeatedly with their formidable health bars and varied attacks.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>-like system at play here, too, which means that you'll drop your soul along with all of your Geo (the game's currency) when you die. You'll need to backtrack and literally fight your own spirit to regain them.</p>

<p>To explain what really sets Hollow Knight apart from pretty much anything else on the eShop, though, we need to go back to its world design. This is a decidedly 2D game, but it's so thick with detail, shade, and texture that it feels positively three-dimensional. The world is full of items and foreground elements that exist only to be broken or smashed through, adding to an enthralling sense of physicality — and it all runs at a silky smooth frame rate in both docked and portable modes.</p>
<p>The sound design is equally inspired, from the dank drip of a drizzly city to the distinctive (and hilariously human) babble of its characters. The map maker's contented hum and a certain boss's prideful goading when you near his lair are particular stand-outs.</p>
<p>Like indie hits Yoku's Island Express and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> before it, Hollow Knight feels like it's found its natural home on Switch. The game's beautiful 2D world, tactile combat, and impressive bevvy of secrets constantly drag you in for more, and it proves to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. On an eShop that's already filled with top-quality indie games, Hollow Knight is one of the very best.</p>

</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hollow Knight is a big, beautiful, forboding Metroidvania that's absolutely thick with detail and feels very much at home on Switch, proving to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. From its punchy combat system to its charming art and sound design, if you're up for the challenge this is one of the finest, richest adventures you can have on Nintendo Switch.</p></section>
