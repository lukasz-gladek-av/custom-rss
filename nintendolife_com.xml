<p>While CEO Ryan Rohen eyes up $35 billion pay packet</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7b93f790bb70d"><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b93f790bb70d/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The coming of the new year is a good time to take stock and look at the 12 months ahead with a sense of optimism. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a>, however, GameStop has instead decided to kick off 2026 by shutting hundreds of its stores in the US.</p>
<p>News of such closures apparently came as quite the shock to employees, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/">signs being hastily pasted to storefronts confirming the news</a>. To add insult to injury, the same signs offered up an extra 20% on trade-ins if customers head to alternative GameStop locations.</p>
<p>Many customers have reportedly noted that some store closures have left them with few alternatives, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q4vm6i/comment/ny0n4bi/">Reddit commenter</a> stating that their nearest store is now "1.5 hours away".</p>

<p>It's estimated that <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html">up to 296 stores closed in the first week of 2026</a>, with even well-performing locations being given the chop. It seems likely that such drastic action is somewhat linked to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm">recent announcement</a> that CEO Ryan Cohen could bag a pay packet worth an astonishing $35 billion, but only if the retailer is able to reach a market cap of $100 billion.</p>
<p>This is roughly ten times its current value at $9.3 billion, so it's a pretty wild target. The announcement clarifies that Cohen "receives no guaranteed pay—no salary, no cash bonuses, and no stock that vests simply over time", with the compensation being entirely "at-risk".</p>
<p>It's not a case of "all or nothing", mind you, with Cohen's compensation available in nine tranches (or 'portions'). The first is available if GameStop achieves a market cap of $20 million, with each subsequent tranche requiring an addition $10 billion in value all the way up to £100 billion. So even if GameStop only manages to reach £20 million, Cohen will still earn billions in shares.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a>, GameStop is also considering ending its EB Games business in New Zealand, which would mean the closure of 38 stores in the region. According to the notice sent to employees, the proposal is "not final, and no decision will be made until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members."</p>

<p>At least, that's what we found this weekend, when the latest 'Frosty Fest' celebration arrived in the Splatlands and crowned yet another Splatfest champ.</p>
<p>It was <strong>Team Solo</strong> that walked away with the win in this year's battle of '<strong>Who do you spend the holidays with?</strong>', snatching up <strong>460p</strong> after a tough weekend of battling. Team Friends narrowly missed out on the gold with their respectable 410p and the less said about Team Family, the better (they finished on 0p, <em>oop</em>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12eohkiwv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, that's Frosty Fest sorted for another year — remember to collect your Super Sea Snails from the plaza if you took part. As far as we know, these seasonal events should continue throughout the rest of 2026 (see you all for 'Spring Fest' in a couple of months, then), that is, unless the as-yet-undated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> brings things to a halt whenever it launches on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">Switch 2 listing for Splatoon 3</a> cropped up on the European age rating board PEGI, sparking rumours that the 2022 shooter may soon return in a swanky new package. Nintendo's yet to confirm any of this, of course, but we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for more updates down the line.</p>

<p>Get ready for a 2026 release</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last September, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> would be arriving in Spring 2026.</p>
<p>We haven't really heard anything about it since then, and now in a slight development, a rating has been spotted on the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Here it is:</p>
<figure data-uuid="4bc525af7d446"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bc525af7d446/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ESRB</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This hopefully means an update about this title is nearby, and perhaps Nintendo will lock in a release date.</p>
<p>When Bellabel Park opens its doors, according to Nintendo, you'll be able to experience a variety of attractions where you team up (or work against) friends and family to collect the most coins, run and hide in "Phanto tag", and much more.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 Edition, this version of the game will "other content and enhancements", with more details to be revealed in the future. You can find out a little more about what to expect in our previous story.</p>
