<p>Surprisingly, there was no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> announcement to be found in this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, but an update reveal wasn't far behind.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the new 'Wisdom of Sea and Sky' expansion, which sees Johto's very own Lugia and Ho-Oh take centre stage in a Gen 2-focused set. The above trailer gives us a closer look at the two legendary ex cards, a handful of full arts and shinies, and, of course, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. All of this will be arriving in the Pokémon TCG Pocket app on <strong>30th July</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're very excited to see the new set in action (it's a good year to be a Totodile fan), the biggest announcement for us was the reveal that the in-game trading feature will be getting a facelift on the same day.</p>
<p>From 30th July, you'll be able to make a wishlist of cards you'd like to trade for via the My Cards screen, so other players can see what you're after and make you an offer. You'll be able to select up to 20 cards for your wishlist, and pin three of them to your profile for all to see.</p>
<p>As promised, Trade Tokens will also become a thing of the past, replaced by the much easier-to-obtain Shinedust (which you get as standard with any repeat card pulls) for three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity trades. You'll be able to cash in your pre-existing Trade Tokens in the in-game shop for Pack Hourglasses or Shinedust.</p>
<p>After months of hardly touching the woefully consumable-based trade system, we might finally start to fill in the blanks in our collection.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:185507,177763 @ 1753369203 -->
<p><em>Are you pleased to finally see the trade update come into effect? What are your thoughts on the next expansion? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc961acefad76/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Japanese boxed charts are in, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/48013">Famitsu</a>, and Nintendo is back to dominating the top ten this week.</p>
<p>The big new release of the moment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has sold a smashing 127,905 units in the week of 14th July to 20th July, but can't quite take the number one spot from the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which shifted another 135,370 copies. DK, of course, was only available for part of the week, so we'll see how far its legs carry it over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> debuted on Switch with 88,421 physical sales, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a> it debuted with 35,717 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The only other new release of the week that cracked the top ten is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, a fighting game based on the hugely popular manga and anime series. However, at least in terms of physical sales, it only managed to shift 3,174 copies on Switch, with other platforms outside the top ten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> continues to do very well, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> remains in the top five with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> joining it — incredibly impressive given that we have that new Mario Kart. Nothing will stop it, eh?</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Switch 2 sales continue to climb as the new console has sold an extra 20k+ units this week compared to last — it shifted 152,165 this week compared to 128,643 last week. That's a nice boost thanks to DK, we reckon.</p>
<p>Once again the Switch OLED and Lite have outsold the PS5, with only the OLED managing to sell above 5,000 units. It's a bit of a drop from last week, but as more new games come to the Switch 2, we're sure more people will move over.</p>

<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157562/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom effectively created a new genre with its famed <strong>Monster Hunter</strong> series back in the sixth generation of game consoles, and though many challengers over the years (such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/god_eater_3">God Eater</a>) have since tried to get a piece of its pie, nobody has quite managed to recreate its distinct magic. Koei Tecmo's Omega Force (of <strong>Dynasty Warriors</strong> fame) then decided to try its hand in 2023 with the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wild_hearts">Wild Hearts</a>, but the game never really got too far off the ground despite positive reception from both fans and critics.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has come out, KT has decided to try giving its latest monster hunting foray another shot at success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, a modest revisit that’s taking advantage of the distinct Monster Hunter-shaped hole in the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">launch window library</a>. Though it isn’t the roaring revival that some may have hoped it to be, Wild Hearts S still proves to be an enjoyable and engaging monster-hunting action game and one that I’d suggest newcomers look into.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155224/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The narrative in Wild Hearts places you in the role of a travelling hunter who comes to the land of Azuma in search of work and meaning after experiencing diminished demand for your services back home. Your services, of course, are hunting and killing Kemono, which are gigantic nature-themed monsters that threaten villages and their surrounding environment.</p>
<p>After getting absolutely <em>rolled</em> by a Deathstalker (basically a huge ice-themed wolf), your hunter meets a mysterious figure who grants him the power of Karakuri, which enables him to utilise spiritual energy threads in the land to create powerful constructs. Armed with this ability, you then head for the nearby town of Minato to help them out with their ongoing Kemono problem. It’s not all that gripping of a story, but there’s just enough here to keep you invested in the town and focused on protecting it from the endemic threats to its ecosystem.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155226/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Wild Hearts adheres pretty closely to the systems that Monster Hunter popularised, focusing much of the experience on the simple, grindy loop of battling the gigantic Kemono monsters. Across four seasonally themed biomes, there are over 20 full-size Kemono species to take on here, and each brings with it a wealth of elemental attacks and tricks to keep you on your toes as you learn its moveset.</p>
<p>An initial battle against a Kemono can be a little rough as you get repeatedly blasted and beaten by its powerful blows, but experience and careful study soon teach you when to press the attack and when to run for cover or dodge. After killing one, it drops an assortment of unique items which you can then use to upgrade existing weapons and armour sets or build new ones that make it easier to take down even harder monsters.</p>
<p>Capcom got the progression system right with Monster Hunter and Omega Force was wise not to try reinventing the wheel with Wild Hearts—it's just as compelling here as it was there. Not only is there a clear sense of empowerment that comes from gaining actual stat buffs from getting better equipment, but you also just get <em>better</em> with practice as you learn each Kemono’s tells and become more efficient in dodging its attacks and exploiting its weaknesses. Plus, given the largely random nature of the rewards from felling yet another massive beast, there’s a strong ‘just one more’ element as you come up a bit short on materials needed for that next equipment upgrade you’ve been eyeing.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157573/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so similar, but the main gimmick that sets Wild Hearts apart is the flexible Karakuri system, which adds some dynamic tools to your hunter’s arsenal. With this, you can summon various constructs, such as boxes or springs, into the field to give you an edge and support you in some way or throw off the Kemono’s assault. If you recognise a Kemono is about to charge, you can quickly build a wall of crates that’ll both block the charge and stun it. If you need a boost to your dwindling health and can’t get a moment to breathe and drink a healing potion, you can drop a healing mist that delivers an AoE effect to anyone in its radius.</p>
<p>The Karakuri system feels like it adds a much-needed ‘X factor’ to the fights to keep them feeling distinct, as they give you something else than just waling away at a Kemono for 10 minutes until it dies. Not only will different people favour different constructs, thus furthering player expression, but continuously unlocking new ones via an extensive skill tree means that there’s always something else to work towards beyond simply more weapons and armour. I really appreciated the various mobility and support options they offer, and hope to see more of this kind of thing in the genre as it evolves further.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157580/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d be remiss not to also mention the extensive selection of weapons on offer, which can really change up your combat approach and give you a lot more replayability to take the edge off of things feeling repetitive as you grind Kemono for rare drops. You can go with more traditional approaches, like the katana or bow, or more unconventional things like the Wagasa, which is a bladed umbrella that uniquely allows you to parry many Kemono attacks.</p>
<p>Each weapon has its own playstyle and quirks, and taking the time to explore them all really goes to show how much depth there is to the combat here, especially when paired with possibilities opened up by the Karakuri constructs.</p>
<p>It's tempting to hope that the ‘S’ in this release’s title indicates some sort of expansion content, perhaps akin to the ‘G rank’ quests that Capcom is keen to later include in its Monster Hunter games. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and this Nintendo debut for Wild Hearts is more of a modest balance patch than anything else.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157564/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The main feature here is that you can now play co-op with four people (up from three in the original release), while monster behaviours and the stats of some weapons have been adjusted to make the experience a bit more enjoyable. If you already put a lot of time into Wild Hearts on other platforms anytime since it released in 2023, there’s not a lot you’re missing out on with the Switch 2 port besides the option to play it on the go.</p>
<p>And though it’s a lovely convenience that Wild Hearts is now playable on a portable console, it’s a bit disappointing that this release isn’t terribly well optimised. The original had its own share of performance issues and that’s clearly been carried over to the Switch 2; frame rates are all over the place and the visuals themselves are a little middling between the somewhat fuzzy resolution and flat textures.</p>
<p>It’s not a <em>mess</em> by any means, but seeing the visual hiccups—especially when the frame rate takes a sharp dive—can take you out of the experience a bit. This one might have benefited from a bit more time in the oven.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wild Hearts S is a satisfying, if unspectacular, addition to the Switch 2’s early library. The monster hunting and equipment building is just as rewarding and addictive as you would hope, and there’s <em>tons</em> of replayability here whether you’re playing solo or with friends.</p>
<p>That being said, the technical performance is just <em>okay,</em> while the lack of any significant content additions to this re-release feels like a missed opportunity, especially if you previously played this on other platforms. I’d still give Wild Hearts a recommendation, as its blemishes don’t ultimately take too much away from its many strengths, but perhaps this is one to wait for a sale.</p></section>
