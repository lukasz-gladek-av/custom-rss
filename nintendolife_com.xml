<p>Well, that didn't take too long! After launching on the Switch eShop back in December, Dotemu and Tribute Games have today updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> to ver. 1.0.5, bundling in a fresh batch of hero colour palettes to boot.</p>
<p>The 'Cosmic Collabs' update includes a new wardrobe option for 12 of the 15-hero roster, each inspired by a different Marvel game. Spider-Man and Venom each get a crossover fit from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Black Panther and Rocket Racoon take theirs from <strong>Marvel Snap</strong> art, She-Hulk and Wolverine's new looks come from <strong>Marvel Strike Force</strong>, Captain America and Nova take inspiration from <strong>Marvel Future Fight</strong>, Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill's palettes are all about <strong>Marvel Contest of Champions</strong>, and even <strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest</strong> gets a nod in Storm and Iron Man's fresh threads.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The update also includes its fair share of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and new features, so you can be sure things are running smoother than ever before as you put these new palettes to the test.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753970?emclan=103582791475080003&amp;emgid=519737782627731794">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion Ver. 1.0.5 (10th Feb 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Epic MARVEL Games Collaborations!</strong></h3>
<p>We’re bringing in tributes to our favourite MARVEL Games experiences, including palettes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Rivals</strong></em> - Spider-Man and Venom</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Snap</strong></em> - Black Panther and Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Strike Force</strong></em> - She-Hulk and Wolverine</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Future Fight</strong></em> - Captain America and Nova</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Contest of Champions</strong></em> - Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Puzzle Quest</strong></em> - Storm and Iron Man</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New Features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Lab Upgrades</strong> - with new palette previews to help you get a great view of new cosmetic options, and a new Team Level indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Tweaked Arcade Modifiers</strong> - swinging into danger with modifications. The Double HP modifier is now an HP Multiplier - where enemy HP can now be multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 times their standard amount!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Improvements!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of visual changes based on your feedback, designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the on-screen action, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroes will now be highlighted when HP is low</li>
<li>The Focus bar has been split to make it easier to read</li>
<li>Special Damage number visuals have been changed to red - making them easier to identify</li>
<li>The Heteropteron Level Larva Bug has been tweaked to make the enemy stand out. In addition, we’ve added flashes on the Larva during throw animations and introduced colour cycling effects on the attack!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also taken some time to go back for further balancing on boss fights, tweaking these to provide a little more fair play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hela</strong> - Increasing cooldowns for both Grudge and Hellblades attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong> - Reducing block and parry actions and removing combo parry, increasing reaction cooldown, lowering damage on the Bite attack and removing some post-Grudge attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phyla-Vell</strong> - Reducing block actions and lowering chance of using Cosmic Attack. We’ve also added cooldown on some attacks, increased the cooldown on cosmic Fury and lengthened the initial block action to prevent instant parry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></h3>
<p>As well as all this, we’re squashing some bugs of our own!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a blocker caused by using Cosmic Ghost Rider’s special attack just before triggering a boss cutscene</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where boss summons would not be defeated alongside the boss, if the summon is receiving damage from a player</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Hela to become permanently immobilized when parried and pushed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taskmaster could become frozen in mid-air when hit during his jump attack (while playing online)</li>

<li>Fixed various issues related to Venom’s passive Slow effect for Standard Attack and Team Assist.</li>

<p>We had a great time with Cosmic Invasion last year, calling it "one of the best arcade Marvel games ever made" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">our review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Poll: So, Do You Prefer Hollow Knight Or Silksong?]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-so-do-you-prefer-hollow-knight-or-silksong</link>
            <guid>1431355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="afbb73de2ace7"><a title="Hollow Knight vs Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afbb73de2ace7/hollow-knight-vs-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite pledging that we'd take a break from games of this ilk when we finished pouring blood, sweat and tears into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> last year, Team Cherry has somehow found a way of dragging us back in with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we put the halls of Hallownest behind us for good many years ago now, but the promise of buttery smooth performance had us flying back to it like a Markoth to a flame — <em>mmm, "additional effects"</em>. The more we played, the more we remembered just how much we love this world, these characters, this floaty little knight.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' we suddenly realised, ' without the performance argument in our arsenal, there's nothing stopping us from asking the ultimate question: do we prefer Hollow Knight or Silksong?'</p>
<p>When Silksong launched last year, it felt like a foregone conclusion. In this sequel, Team Cherry had done everything in its power to take what made the first game so wonderful, and make it even <em>wonderfuller</em>. Hornet is quicker and more acrobatic than the Knight. Her tools open more combat possibilities than we ever thought possible. The map makes Hallownest feel piddly.</p>
<p>We even said as much in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>: "It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way." And yes, for reference, we <em>only</em> awarded its predecessor a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>But, returning to Hallownest on Switch 2 in recent days, our preference isn't quite as clean cut as it was back in September, when the long-awaited Silksong was still so shiny and new in our hands. The map may be smaller, but it feels just as dense. The overarching narrative of the fallen kingdom is sublimely woven into your surroundings, with a simplicity that's tough to knock. And can anything ever truly replicate the feeling of pure dread experienced with your first steps into Deepnest?</p>
<figure data-uuid="2ec88e322390e"><a title="Hollow Knight / Silksong Bench" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2ec88e322390e/hollow-knight-silksong-bench.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>So... come here often? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, there are voices for both sides of the argument here at Nintendo Life Towers, so we thought it was only right to throw it out to you, our lovely readers. Do Silksong's improvements leave it at the top spot in your mind, or is Hollow Knight still your number one? You can cast your <del>Zote</del> vote in the following poll.</p>
