<p>Hideo Kojima has been out and about and doing interviews at the Sydney Film Festival as part of the build-up to the release of his upcoming, Australian-set sequel, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/i-almost-gave-up-hideo-kojima-on-looking-into-the-abyss-death-stranding-2s-australian-setting-working-with-his-idols-and-connecting-with-koalas/">GamesRadar</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> director openly chatted about a whole bunch of topics, including one rather cool Game Boy Advance title by Konami that he produced back in 2003. During the conversation, as he discusses his creative spark and how eureka moments come about, he mentions <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/boktai_the_sun_is_in_your_hand">Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand</a> as an example of his interest in infusing game experiences with new tech.</p><p><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97frziwuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Indeed, with this in mind, Kojima gave an example of how Konami's toy division once manufactured a UV-light-detecting teddy bear (just what we've always wanted!). It failed to gain any traction, for some reason, and so, with Konami sitting on a load of unused components, Kojima pounced, striking a deal on the UV-sensor tech on the cheap to incorporate into the Boktai cartridges so that the game could detect actual real sunlight and charge up your in-game weapon to kill vampires. Pretty rad, right?</p>
<p>"UV sensors were so expensive at the time," he said. "You have to select the ideas at the best time."</p>

<p>And so it proved, as Boktai released to cracking reviews, and sits on a rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/boktai-the-sun-is-in-your-hand/">83% over at Metacritic</a>, which is actually 1% more than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, so maybe someone should look at sticking some UV tech into the sequel, eh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2, and we thought it was really rather good. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">9/10 review of the Switch 1 version</a>, we said it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well," praising the sheer amount of compelling stuff to do alongside the "edgy and dramatic" story.</p>
<p>The kind folks over at Marvelous have sent us the physical Limited Edition of the Switch 1 game to check out, and we thought you might like to see exactly what's included in this edition. So we've put together a cheeky little gallery to peruse at your leisure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xosjtg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What's included, exactly? Well, the star of the show is a rather beautiful Sacred Fan with an accompanying clear display stand. You've also got a Woolby Plush Keychain, a 161-page softback art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and the game itself on cartridge.</p>
<p>Definitely some high-quality goodies, and we're particularly enamoured with the art book â€“ it's chock-full of character designs and environment paintings. Gorgeous stuff. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition is still available and priced at <strong>Â£79.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US (if you can find one). A proper physical edition for the Switch 2 (i.e. not a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>) is also available for <strong>Â£59.99 / $69.99</strong> (or alternatively you can opt for the upgrade pack for <strong>Â£10 / $10</strong> if you already have the Switch 1 version).</p>
<p><em>Huge thanks to Marvelous for sending us a sample to check out. Have you tried Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on Switch or Switch 2 yet? Are you tempted to grab a copy of the Limited Edition? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>

<p>She ain't no Odd Rock</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e21dc5f3ea534/dk-bananza-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a> from Nintendo revealed that DK's new companion, Odd Rock, isn't actually Odd Rock at all, but rather a young Pauline. Gasp!</p>
<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Pauline - DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fdc75f17bb9a/pauline-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

<p>The main additions this time around are a new camera perspective, tweaks to flying on Skelegon, the option to re-listen to Life Songs and farming adjustments. Of course, there are also a bunch of bug fixes besides, to keep the play experience that bit smoother.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179kjoguq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
