<p>Was due in November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7693829e5141b"><a title="Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7693829e5141b/lollipop-chainsaw-repop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dragami Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans of extremely bloody, sugary sweet violence were likely excited to get their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-is-getting-a-sweet-switch-2-edition-upgrade-this-november">this month</a>. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a little bit longer, as Dragami Games have announced a last-minute delay. The game will now be launching in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>But there's actually a good reason for the delay this time around — "While the title was initially planned to be released as a digital-only version, we received many requests for a physical edition following the announcement" the developer states <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413">on social media</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tzuiwo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>"In response, and with the cooperation of multiple publishing partners, we are now able to prepare physical releases for multiple regions." The delay is to allow both the digital and physical versions to release at the same time.</p>

<p>So, we think we can all wait just a few more months to get the game on a cartridge, right? At least, we assume it'll be a full physical release.</p>
<p>We hope the Switch 2 Edition improves some of our issues with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lollipop_chainsaw_repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a> on the Switch, which suffered from rough performance. It's not the <em>best</em> game in the world, but it's a cult hit with many, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lollipop-chainsaw-repop">we were disappointed with the rerelease</a>.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are working on updates to their docks</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="63d4585372042"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 with S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63d4585372042/nintendo-switch-2-with-s3-max-tv-dock-station-by-antank.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following reports that some Switch 2 owners are having issues with third-party docks, Nintendo has addressed the issue.</p>
<p>In a response to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">Kotaku</a>, a representative told the outlets that "Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>
<p>The issue of third-party compatibility <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">cropped up earlier this week</a> after the Nintendo Switch 2 Version 21.0.0 update dropped. Many who have updated their consoles to the latest version have found that their third-party docks are no longer working with the console.</p>
<p>Some have even said that the official Switch 2 dock also stopped working after the update, but a quick restart has fixed this.</p>
<p>While not all third-party docks are affected, and some manufacturers have managed to put out hotfixes, it seems like the issues caused by the latest update are completely unintentional. Still, some manufacturers are suggesting Switch 2 owners to hold off on updating their console <em>until</em> they've managed to get a fix going.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the representative explained, reiterating that the original Switch works similarly.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 dock situation has been a little tenuous in the early months of the console's life. Reports from July this year suggest that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">the USB-C chip may be responsible</a> for some other compatibility issues. These issues are unrelated to the latest update.</p>

<p>One thing that's quietly slipped by, however, is the reveal of a brand-new suit for our protagonist Samus Aran. As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NinWire/status/1989347451074171162">Nintendo Wire</a> in the below post, the suit can be seen in a short clip posted on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">official Japanese website</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, it's got a similar vibe to Samus' new red suit, but there are also some clear similarities to the <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Suit">Light Suit</a> seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>What do you think? We wonder what kind of properties these new suits will take on. Will they grant new abilities? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Previews have now gone live for Prime 4, including our own. It seems many folks aren't too keen on the new Galactic Federation Troopers accompanying Samus on her journey, but otherwise, this definitely looks and feels like a new Prime game. Heck yeah.</p>
