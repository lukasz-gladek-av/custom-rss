<figure data-uuid="3e8d957c9bbec"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e8d957c9bbec/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has more amiibo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — that was already true when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">they were revealed during the September Nintendo Direct</a>, but a second one (that just aired) has unveiled three more.</p>
<p>Meta Knight and Shadow Star, King Dedede and Tank Star, and Chef Kawasaki and Hop Star will be joining the pricey set of amiibo in 2026. Meta Knight will swoop in on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, with King Dedede and Kawasaki to follow later in the year.</p>
<p>Like Kirby and Waddle Dee, these three are much bigger than your standard amiibo, but not only that, you can swap each of the characters between vehicles. They attach via magnets, meaning they clip on rather nicely indeed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Oh, and in the case of at least the Tank Star, you can change the positioning of the tracks and wheels, which will transform the vehicle in-game. Neat!</p>

<p>Now, of course, the price — nothing official has been revealed, but given that retailers are listing Kirby and Waddle Dee at $49.99 in the US, we have to imagine that these other three will also retail at the same price. That means if you want all five, you'll have to cough up around $250 plus tax. Ouch...</p>

<p>Tarnished Edition pushed to 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="b6a5ec64ea5f2"><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6a5ec64ea5f2/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are delaying the planned launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2 until next year.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to arrive on Nintendo's console before the end of 2025, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">a post</a> from the game's official X account apologises to players and says the delay into 2026 is "to allow time for performance adjustments."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.<br>
We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FromSoft's game was playable at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> back in August, although various outlets (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">including ourselves</a>) reported disappointing performance on Nintendo's system, especially in handheld mode, with frame drops and stuttering especially noticeable in the more open areas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbuqpizw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The game launched elsewhere back in February 2022 to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/elden-ring">glowing reviews</a>, and was followed by the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC in 2024, which will be included in the Tarnished Edition.</p>
<p>It's unsurprising, perhaps, that such an ambitious game might struggle on handheld hardware, but we'd hoped for a smooth, consistent experience on Switch 2 despite the familiar caveats of running a full-fat, cross-platform, home console game like this on portable hardware.</p>
<p>However, although it's disappointing to see this one slip into next year — at least for those of us who had holiday plans involving a trip to the Lands Between — if the devs need more time to make this edition not-quite-so-tarnished, so be it.</p>
