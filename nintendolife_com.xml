<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>
<p>And hey, if previews are anything to go by, this looks pretty solid; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">IGN</a>, <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145273/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">Shacknews</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-2-hours-with-the-silent-hill-2-devs-slimy-sci-fi-beast-cronos-im-thrilled-it-has-dead-space-dna-and-the-soul-of-resident-evil-this-is-more-like-a-love-letter-to-survival-horror-than-to-poland/">Gamesradar</a> all have good things to say.</p>

<figure><a title="Gulikit Elves 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95e9d6a81fb88/gulikit-elves-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gulikit has announced the 'Elves 2', a new wireless controller for the Switch and Switch 2 touted as the first third-party controller to offer 'wake-up' support for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Available in Coral Red and Translucent Black, the Elves 2 is a different proposition from its 'Pro' variant, (which is already available - you can check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">full review for all the details</a>). The new model is missing a few key features, such as APG recording and custom thumbstick sensitivity, but it's still got gyro support, three levels of rumble intensity, and those all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with removable caps.</p>
<p>The Elves 2 is priced at $29.99 and is available from Amazon now in the US and Japan, with Europe to follow "soon". Select global retailers will also offer the pad, though pricing may vary depending on region.</p>
<p>"We’re proud to be the first controller brand globally to support wake-up functionality on the Switch 2 at launch," said Gulikit in its press release.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the pad's key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Retro-Inspired Ergonomics:</strong><br>
Shaped after the Sega Genesis controller for comfortable, fatigue-free play. Compact and lightweight for gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong>- World-First Switch 2 Wake-Up Support:<br></strong>Instantly wake up your Switch 2 from sleep mode—GuliKit is the first controller brand to offer this feature out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>- Dual Hall Effect Joysticks:<br></strong>Drift-free performance with 2200-level high precision and long-lasting durability.</p>
<p><strong>- Advanced Haptics with Asymmetric Dual-Rotor Motors:</strong><strong><br></strong>Three levels of responsive vibration feedback for immersive gameplay, similar to Xbox's tactile feel.</p>
<p><strong>- Universal Compatibility:<br></strong>Works seamlessly with Switch 2, Switch, Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p><strong>- Classic Floating D-Pad:<br></strong>Perfect for fighting games, with precise actuation and fast combo execution.</p>
<p><strong>- Pro-Level Input:<br></strong> Tactile triggers and silent conductive rubber buttons for fast, responsive, and comfortable control.</p>
<p><strong>- Wired &amp; Wireless Modes:<br></strong>Choose between Bluetooth (730Hz polling rate) or wired (1000Hz) connections for ultra-low latency.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
