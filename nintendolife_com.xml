<p>Put your Switch 2 down for a second, folks, because we are mere minutes away from <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct!</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that's taking the spotlight for this one, with a 15-minute deep dive into the upcoming adventure swinging into action at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 3pm CEST</strong>.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly what the showcase will hold, but we feel like Nintendo probably has a secret or two up its sleeve. We've seen a fair amount of Bananza from the reveal Direct, Treehouse footage and our own hands-on time with it at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-rock-surfing-and-boulder-bashing-donkey-kong-bananza-is-brilliantly-bonkers">Switch 2 Experience</a>, but this looks like the kind of game that has <em>a lot</em> packed into it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't have long to wait until the Direct gets underway. The presentation is being streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (and its regional variants), but you can also watch along with us — and have a good old natter about all the surprises — below.</p>
<p>So, get comfy, grab a banana or two, and let's get ready to rock and roll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hades-2-full-release-is-getting-close-as-development-enters-final-phase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>After over a year in early access, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> is finally gearing up for its full release — which, let's not forget, will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hades-ii-will-officially-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-ahead-of-other-consoles">arriving on Switch and Switch 2 ahead of other consoles</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for the hotly-anticipated sequel, we should point out, though with the release of the latest early access update, Supergiant Games has teased that it is "getting close" to ver. 1.0 (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>"After more than a year of Early Access development, we're now starting to prepare for our v1.0 launch," the team wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post</a> on Steam. Supergiant says it is "heading into the final phase of Hades II development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches", and it will be sharing more info on the full release "as soon as we can".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As the post suggested there, the new 'Unseen Update' expands the game's core combat, Guardian encounters and character relationships, and gears things up for the introduction of the game's "true ending" — which the dev plans to add before the ver. 1.0 release, fortunately.</p>
<p>All this means that Supergiant is now officially winding down its early access phase. "Our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet," the blog post continues, "and — most importantly — a worthy successor to the original Hades".</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up," the post concludes. "While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades II is still to come, so <em>may moonlight guide us!</em>"</p>
<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but boy are we excited to see what the full release has to offer. We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">hands-on</a> with the early access build last year, and we were delighted by what we saw. Heck, if this sequel is even a fraction as compelling as its predecessor, we're going to be in for an almighty time sink when it finally lands on Switch.</p>

<p>Playable on Switch 2, too</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random">Lost In Random</a> was very well-received when it launched back in 2021, with our very own review awarding the hybrid of roguelike, dice-rolling, deckbuilding, boardgame and real-time action (phew!) a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lost-in-random">great 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>So, it may be of interest to you to know that the sequel to all of this very good stuff, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a>, came out yesterday on Switch (and Switch 2, though only via backwards compatibility - how very exciting that we now live in such a thriving ecosystem).</p>
<p>Described as a "fast-paced roguelike set in the world of Lost In Random", this sequel from Stormteller Games — now with Thunderful on publishing duties — serves as the next chapter in the story of a world where children must roll a dice to decide their stations in life. Which seems harsh (although what's the chances they'll end up in a worse spot than "games journalist"?)</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Of course, your main protagonists aren't having any of that, and we expect a further fight back against the establishment will follow as a new tale involving the Queen of Random — yes, the world here is called Random, you see — unfolds before us in the series' unique graphical style. As the press release details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mastery Meets Chance</strong>: Engage in fast-paced, second-to-second combat that blends real-time action with strategic decision-making - and a touch of luck.</p>
<p><strong>Forge Your Playstyle</strong>: Wield four unique weapons, throw your die-companion, and combine 100+ relics with powerful card-based abilities to unleash devastating synergies.</p>
<p><strong>Ever-Changing World</strong>: Traverse four randomly generated worlds, each with its own distinct secrets and challenges and face over 30 different enemy types and formidable bosses.</p>
<p><strong>A Dark Fantasy Tale</strong>: Immerse yourself in a fully voiced story set in a Tim Burton-inspired world, brought to life with hauntingly beautiful landscapes and an enchanting soundtrack."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Judging by the game's trailer, there's more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> in the mix here, which is a very good thing indeed, and feedback over on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/">very positive</a> thus far, so this is defo one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die released yestoday (17th June) with a 10% launch discount putting it at <strong>$22.49/£17.99.</strong> The Fortune Edition, which includes a special digital artbook, exclusive soundtrack and cosmetic DLC is available for <strong>$28.99/£23.19.</strong></p>

<figure><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc02debacf86e/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SIE</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, one of the PS5's most surprising success stories, is reportedly in consideration for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5s-stellar-blade-is-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), developer Shift Up has secured a dev kit for the Switch 2 and has begun intial work for a supposed port of the game. The team has also gifted a whole bunch of Switch 2 units to its employees.</p>
<p>Shift Up itself has told PlayForum that "nothing is confirmed" regarding a potential Switch 2 release, but that it is "reviewing various possibilities internally".</p><p><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6eqhotmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The biggest question mark with all of this is whether Sony Interactive Entertainment would handle publishing duties for the Switch 2. The company is no stranger to releasing games on Nintendo hardware, having notably launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> simultaneously with its PS5 release in 2024.</p>
<p>A hypthetical launch on the Switch 2 isn't entirely out of the question, however, since Stellar Blade recently made its way to the Steam Deck to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawWWDl7FZM">positive critical reception</a>, despite its inability to maintain that 60fps sweet spot.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's vastly improved specs over its predecessor has meant that games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> run remarkably well. The former has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2">praised by Digital Foundry</a>, with positive comparisons made to the game on Xbox Series S in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes and ears open for a potential Stellar Blade launch on the Switch 2 in the coming months, and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>It wasn't-a me</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas. The theft was discovered while the driver was at a Love's truck stop in Bennett, Colorado on 8th June during a routine inspection.</p>
<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>
<p>One GameStop store recently come under fire for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">stapling receipts to Switch 2 console boxes</a>, penetrating the packaging and damaging the console's screen inside. The company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">attempted to make light of the situation</a> with an amusing social media post, but again drew criticism for having allegedly used a photo that rightly belongs to the outlet Bloomberg.</p>
