<p>If you happen to be heading to the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California this weekend, you can receive a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> distribution.</p>
<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>We know very few details right now, except that the panel will be a 90-minute megaton "showcasing all of Capcom’s recent and upcoming releases." It all kicks off at <strong>3:45 pm EST on Friday 10th October</strong> — we've listed times for the showcase below, but note that these NYCC panels aren't often broadcast unless you pay for <a href="https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/en-us/memberships.html">Popverse membership</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7qzjxlr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, this is far from the first time Capcom has been to Comic-Con — the company has attended multiple times over the years. But In terms of Switch and Switch 2 games, the only real new game appearance is likely to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>. But we may get a look at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC too?</p>
<p>However, we'd recommend that you don't get your hopes up <em>too</em> much for any major announcements. But really, we'd love to see some <strong>Mega Man</strong>. C'mon, Capcom! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mega-man-is-one-of-capcoms-most-important-ips-despite-no-new-games-in-7plus-years">You said it was one of your "most-important IPs!"</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158064/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>While playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> for this review, I visited an exhibition at London’s Science Museum: <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/power">Power Up</a> – a hands-on tour of the last five decades of video games. There, in an expansive, dark basement, an orange-illuminated wall of computers and consoles took me right through the 1980s. I sampled such delicacies as a flickery <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/spectrum/chuckie_egg">Chuckie Egg</a> on the BBC Micro, an Asteroids-type game on the Vectrex, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> on the NES. It was like an 8-bit time machine, beep-blooping me into any year I fancied, to have a little taste of what was there.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is just like that – except the time machine has taken a wrong turn and ended up in a parallel universe. Here, a pioneering (fictional) company, UFO Soft, produced a snazzy home console called the Lazer-X, then prolifically churned out games for it over eight years from 1982 to 1989. The IRL developers – a group of six indie devs at Mossmouth (Derek Yu’s studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>) – calling themselves the “UFO 50 Recovery Team”, unearthed this machine. They also rescued 50 of its games, so the story goes, and lovingly restored them so that players could transport themselves back through “history”.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158063/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>And talk about committing to the bit. UFO 50 opens with the credits (otherwise you’d need to get through 50 games to see them, I guess), in which the team is seen in lo-fi photos finding and rescuing the Lazer-X and its games. Then, you see a screenful of 50 disks, navigated using only the d-pad and two buttons found on the Lazer-X itself. Highlighting a game gives you only the slightest information, immediately creating a sense of exploration. Each equally alluring, it’s almost impossible to choose where to start. Thinking I’d need to play them all for this review, I went chronologically, jumping in with 1982’s <em>Barbuta</em>.</p>
<p>One distinctive thing about the games of the '80s was how unfair they could sometimes be. No tutorials, no hand-holding, but a lot of trial and error. I won’t spoil it, but the first button-press of the first game of the anthology is a joke riffing on that – and a pretty good one, too. 'Barbuta' is a rudimentary Metroidvania which, while rather inscrutable, is full of charm. Before I knew it, an hour had disappeared, and I realised I’d only illuminated one of the icons on the jam-packed game selection screen. Pushing on in chronological order was going to be too workmanlike, so I just started to browse. And that’s where the joy of UFO 50 really comes out.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158065/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In an <strong>Edge</strong> magazine interview in 2024, co-developer and composer Eirik Suhrke explained that the overwhelming one-time dump of 50 games – not gated, not structured – was intended to conjure the feeling of picking through shareware titles or demo discs. You might also say it’s like scrolling through a pile of ROMs. It’s the opposite of squeezing every last drop out of the one game you got for Christmas as a kid: nothing needs to be played for more than a few moments if you don’t want to. Switching games is so rapid and frictionless that the huge catalogue soon merges into one singular game experience.</p>
<p>You might compare it to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare</a> in that regard, but while Wario’s sequences of micro-games immediately dissolved into just one uber-game, the parts of UFO 50 are much more substantial, and the overall game therefore absolutely epic. Its component parts may include relatively throwaway arcade titles, like 'Magic Garden' and 'Ninpek' (although even those bring some good ideas), but there’s also a fully fledged JRPG, a brilliant deck builder, multiple puzzle games, platformers, sequels to those platformers…. These are 50 <em>full games</em>, ready to pick up and put down, like you’re strolling around the Science Museum’s exhibits. Some will land with you, some won’t, but the luxury of having them all there means you’ll dip into genres you might not normally go for. You need only play any game for as long as your curiosity lasts – but too many of them caught me off guard, and the hours disappeared unnoticed.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158061/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In a way, of course, UFO 50 is a study of the real history of games – the conventions, technologies and design principles that all had to find their feet in those early years. But since this is just one interpretation of game history, it’s very strongly subjective. As such, it’s not exclusionary – not the private domain of experts or older players: a 12-year-old in 2025 could pick this all up without ever having seen a CRT. It’s particularly interesting then to consider the personal gaming history of the developers – wouldn’t it be fascinating to know what shaped their fantasy of gaming’s growth through the 80s? Luckily enough, Derek Yu appeared on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/derek-yu-gamemaker-spelunky-ufo-50">the podcast My Perfect Console</a> when UFO 50 launched on Steam, and shared just that.</p>
<p>He told of his experience of <strong>NetHack</strong>, a 1987 roguelike. More than the game itself, the fascination was that he found it on a disk in his house and loaded it up in DOS, not even knowing whether it was a game at all. The pure mystery of that comes across when diving into some random option in UFO 50. Yu also talked about his dad drawing maps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> – perhaps no surprise, then, that 'Barbuta' features a blank grid in the corner of the UI, practically shouting at you to get your graph paper, like a pixelated maths teacher.</p>
<p>While the joyous mystery of flicking through disks is all there by design, there’s one unplanned fact about UFO 50: it took a real-world <em>eight years</em> to make – not the usual two or three. That in itself is an enticing story: while there are rich snippets of the history of UFO Soft’s games and growth, I’d lap up a version of the game that spelled out the true history of Mossmouth and its eight-year quest. Which games came first? What led to what? How were all the inevitable ups and downs?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What stands out about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, Mossmouth’s delightful collection of retro-styled games, is not that so many of them are absolute bangers – although they are – rather, it’s the fact that it genuinely all comes together as a single experience. In this game, you are a visitor in some wonderful exhibition, and UFO 50 is your 8-bit time machine. It's magnificent, and a perfect fit for Switch.</p></section>
