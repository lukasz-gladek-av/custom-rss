<p>Well, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">Lener30 on Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), there's a little more than a line of code pointing to a port this time. This time, a "Tutorial image for Local Communication" has apparently been found and (as posted by Universo Nintendo's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necro.universonintendo.com/post/3mf64ozbqes2j">Necro Felipe</a>) that sure isn't Sony or Microsoft hardware:</p>

<p>Pinches of salt and all that — and Capcom is obviously keeping quiet — but assuming it's legit, that's a smoking gun and a half. "Interestingly enough they scrubbed all the text mentions of the NSW2 Version," says Lener30.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was a big hit on Switch, of course, but if you haven't been keeping track of Monster Hunter happenings outside the realm of Nintendo systems, Wilds launched back in February 2025 and became the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history.</p>
<p>It went down well with critics, too, although not <em>quite</em> as well as 2018's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a>; the latter is sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-wilds/">"Generally Favourable"</a> 88 on Metacritic versus the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-world/">"Universal Acclaim"</a> of World's 90.</p>

<p>Oof. Apologies.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ac56ce1c8a42f"><a title="EA Sports FC 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac56ce1c8a42f/ea-sports-fc-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t9y1">Match of the Day</a> commentator Guy Mowbray has been a staple voice in various football (soccer) games over the years. Having worked on the iconic BBC show for over 20 years, he's become one of the defining voices of the sport for a thousands.</p>
<p>But commentating real football game on live TV is <em>very</em> different to supplying voice lines for a video game franchise like <strong>EA Sports FC</strong>, and in a report from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC Sport</a>, it's been revealed that EA uses an AI replica of Mowbray's voice to do some of the work. With Mowbray's permission, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r2Zh6lJRTak" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr2Zh6lJRTak" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed62bd51gjnpvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In the piece, Mowbray — whose first video game commentary can be heard on the UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002 on PS2 — admits that doing voiceover for EA nowadays is a "never-ending job" as it "constantly needs updating" with new names joining the beautiful game constantly alongside additional game modes and new terms.</p>
<p>"Either recording or doing prep, it is part of my weekly routine - pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July", Mowbray says, meaning it takes up a huge chunk of the football season in the UK.</p>
<p>It's not just that Mowbray has to say hundreds of footballer names, however, more that he has to say each of them multiple different times in different styles, pitches, or tones, depending on where they might be on the pitch and what they're doing. With over 20,000 players in the FC, that's a huge ask. Which is where AI comes in, at least to help with some of the player names.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of our development pipeline - from animation to gameplay systems - and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences," EA tells the BBC, reiterating that the human touch is necessary for the experience: "...when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."</p>

<p>Mowbray collaborates with EA on this, and advised that the commentary "has got to be at different levels depending where he is on the pitch, as I would do when commentating normally."</p>
<p>"It can't be scripted for me because it has got to be in my style and how I would say it in real life, so I have to think of those lines myself. It's the same for Sue [Smith] on co-comms — she will need 10 different ways of adding insight or colour too."</p>
<p>So it's a very in-depth process, but it's not clear whether EA uses AI for commentators other than Mowbray. We've reached out to EA for clarification on this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of concerns about AI use around actors and voice actors in particular, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/bayonetta-star-jennifer-hale-on-the-sag-aftra-strikes-ai-is-coming-for-us-all">Mass Effect star Jennifer Hale speaking out about the issue back in 2024</a>, and a number of strikes held by voice acting unions over the years.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/love-eternal</link>
            <guid>1440547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162117/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Published by Ysbryd Games and developed by brlka, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> is an arduous platformer presented primarily in a retro 4:3 aspect ratio. It follows a teenage girl named Maya as she wends her way through a lonesome, though artfully-depicted, castle and the surreal, twisted memories that haunt it.</p>
<p>The game begins as many platformers do: through a series of progressively more challenging areas, I’m introduced to our white-haired protagonist’s limited, yet effective, skill set. Maya is able to jump and high jump, but her main ability flips gravity, sending her feet-first towards the top of the screen. The obstacles in the early areas are the expected spiked surfaces, moving platforms, and simple puzzles amid a variety of dark, unusual stages.</p>
<p>While the art as a whole is one of Love Eternal’s more tantalising draws, I was particularly taken by the hand-painted backdrops for each level. They suggest an expansiveness that would be difficult to achieve with the shape of each screen alone, while the thinly etched netting visibly draped over suburban neighbourhoods and palm trees hints at a larger picture of Maya’s prison.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162120/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Flipping gravity certainly isn't a unique inclusion for a platformer (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> is one example), but Love Eternal makes it the focus of gameplay to an engaging degree. Once Maya 'flips', she can’t do so again until she’s landed on a surface. Sometimes there are red orbs that recharge the ability if you touch them mid-air, which make a satisfying glass-shattering sound when struck.</p>
<p>Many levels require you to navigate through a maze of deadly impediments, all without ever touching the ground. Recharging the gravity flip is what makes this possible, with the red orbs acting almost as bouncing points that guide the way. But flipping isn't instantaneous. If you're barreling towards a spiked surface and flips too late, your residual momentum will smash Maya against the ceiling with a crackling gasp. It requires an almost mathematical eye towards timing and acceleration that nonetheless begins to become instinctual after a fashion.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162118/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A subtly unsettling score underlines your explorations throughout the castle--a welcoming softness in the contrast to the sharper sound effects of so many deaths. And make no mistake, you will die. A lot.</p>
<p>The game's difficulty embodies the traditional rhythm of platformers. As soon as I'd painstakingly mastered every minor motion and each instant of precise timing in one realm, I finally escaped the prison I started to loathe and am unleashed upon a new level that I'll have to learn a fresh sequence of tediously ordered movements to defeat. For those who love punishing platform mechanics, this is probably a boon. Those who only grind through high difficulty gameplay to unearth satisfying story elements might have a more mixed experience.</p>
<p>Love Eternal bills itself as a psychological horror. It seems to deliver on this promise in the first half, but the tone segues into strange humour and meta-narrative in the latter part of the game. Beware: there are some story spoilers ahead. The set-up is brief but chilling. Maya begrudgingly sits down to dinner with her family before being asked to go answer the phone. She follows the ringing into the hallway, and picks up the phone only to find silence on the other end. When she returns to the dining room, everyone is gone from the table and the front door is open. Walking outside is when the game starts in earnest, as Maya finds her home is just one of many ruins amidst an eerie landscape.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162119/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As Maya navigates the labyrinthine environment, she stumbles upon bizarre versions of her life and family members. Soon, she begins to uncover memories of others who were trapped like herself, and eventually she is confronted by the very entity who is holding her hostage.</p>
<p>This is where both the tone and gameplay take a definitive turn. This lonely 'god' delivers a literal PowerPoint presentation featuring clip art which, while funny, still manages to be frightening. Unfortunately, the deity basically lays out her entire plan and motive for trapping people. As with horror in any format, the more the curtain is pulled back on the mystery the less scary everything becomes.</p>
<p>After a chase sequence challenge (actually one of the easier levels for me), the game format changes in a manner reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a>. Suddenly, it isn't a side-scrolling platformer, but a first-person point-and-click. Maya appears to be back in her regular life, but something's obviously not quite right. She has a brother instead of a sister, and her dad isn’t the same man that’s shown earlier in the game but instead another one of the god’s trapped pets. Most notably, the begrudged god has taken on the role of Lacey—a friend referenced in earlier scenes as having bailed on plans with her.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/1621111/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly, the gameplay in this section leaves a lot to be desired. Your actions are generally limited to “look,” “talk,” “use,” and “move.” Each scene requires you to select these to progress, but it’s an illusion of choice. I wasn’t even allowed to pour my cereal in the wrong order by putting the milk in first. Lack of control can be horrifying, but in this case it was more boring than anything else. Despite some genuinely skin-crawling moments, I didn't find this part enjoyable to play through and it disrupted the pacing significantly.</p>
<p>While she eventually breaks her way back out into the platforming side of the game, there is another framing shift towards the meta that comes later on. Essentially, the game starts over, but a streamer is “playing” the game. She narrates gameplay, but the player maintains control of Maya’s movements.</p>
<p>The streamer is given different levels to play than the actual sequence from the beginning of the game, including the final level. I know that I must have taken longer than intended to beat it because the streamer ran out of dialogue well before I was able to get through.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162122/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, I occasionally had an issue where the sound would cut in and out. Going without it highlighted for me how much I had been relying on the red gem sound effect to help time my movements. I found that restarting the game did restore the sound, but it still cut out a few more times during my playthrough.</p>
<p>The ending was more trippy than substantive, and it left me feeling like I'd missed something. There was yet another game within a game at the very end: a more old-school style action adventure. I’m sure someone will enjoy figuring out what happens if you can progress far enough within it, but by the time I got my “game over,” I was happy to leave my Love Eternal experience in its pretty grave.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The platforming elements of Love Eternal are delightfully frustrating fun with a limited set of mechanics put to creative and clean use. Multiple levels had me holding my breath, gritting my teeth, and cursing the wayward god who founded the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn levels are as beautiful as their challenges are frustrating. Unfortunately, an overly ambitious narrative coupled with a strange mid-game shift mars the game's myriad charms.</p></section>

<p>Onto hardware now, and, as will come as a surprise to nobody, the Switch 2 is still way ahead of the pack. OLED sales surged last week, pushing up over the 20,000 mark and skewing things firmly in Switch 1's favour against the PS5 when combining the SKU sales — Switch 1 pulled in 26,521, while the three PS5 models got 11,588.</p>
<p>And let's give a shoutout to the PS4, which nabbed another 25 sales this week and <em>somehow</em> managed to outsell the Xbox Series X. Hey, that's the power of Yakuza.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the full hardware charts:</p>
