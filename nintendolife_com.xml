<figure data-uuid="c15f0e18dd225"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c15f0e18dd225/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are getting ever closer to the release of <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> on <strong>1st April</strong>, and over the weekend, Nintendo revealed its official roster of character posters for the film's main players.</p>
<p>We took a look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marios-joined-by-some-familiar-foes-in-new-galaxy-movie-poster">foe-filled Mario one</a> last week, but an additional six posters have since been released, each showing a different character in a unique locale. These have been shared across the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supermariomovie/">Galaxy Movie social accounts</a> and as a daily upload on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a>, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather them all together for you check out in one place.</p>
<p>Below, we've done just that! You'll find each of the seven posters in the order they were revealed, accompanied by a write-up of some smaller details you might have missed. Let's-a go!</p>

<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters</h2>
<h3 id="mario">Mario</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2033ad3ec6889"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2033ad3ec6889/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure."</p>
<p>You might have already spotted this one in our coverage from last week, but it's too good not to mention again. Aside from Mario pulling his iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Galaxy</a> 'spin' pose, we'll also give a shoutout to the range of enemies on display here. <em>Sledge Bro</em>? That's a deeper cut than we expected.</p>
<h3 id="luigi">Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cf1ecf62abd60"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf1ecf62abd60/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Conquering his fears, no bones about it."</p>
<p>Luigi's spotlight is expectedly fear-filled, <em>but</em> we do get a closer look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Tostarena setting that we first saw in the film's initial reveal trailer and its skeletal inhabitants. It looks... well, like Tostarena.</p>
<h3 id="bowser">Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="39ee7a3fa8d61"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39ee7a3fa8d61/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"He's got an ax (or two) to grind."</p>
<p>Aside from looking really rather threatening with those two axes held aloft, Bowser's poster crams a lot into the background. The big wheel and Bullet Bill merry-go-round have a whiff of World Bowser from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and what's with that giant UFO in the sky? Huh, looks like the King of the Koopas will be getting big again after all.</p>
<h3 id="peach-andamp-toad">Peach &amp; Toad</h3>
<figure data-uuid="40287951410dc"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40287951410dc/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Always looking out for the little guy."</p>
<p>Wow, there are <em>a lot</em> of cameos in this one. The penguins make a return from the first movie, but we've also got the Galaxy Star Bunnies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s Pianta, a Conkdor, and even some Whittles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. And what's with all of those rockets blasting off to a nearby galaxy? Hmm, a lot to digest here.</p>
<h3 id="rosalina">Rosalina</h3>
<figure data-uuid="de4cce9f161ca"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de4cce9f161ca/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The stars of a new story."</p>
<p>Yep, we're fans of this Rosalina design. There's a particularly cute Baby Luma on the left, and our first proper look at the Comet Observatory in the background on the right.</p>
<h3 id="bowser-jr">Bowser Jr.</h3>
<figure data-uuid="5464d43f9f1e2"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5464d43f9f1e2/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"No wonder he's a menace."</p>
<p>A Bowser Jr-shaped planet, battleships, and a magic paintbrush that spits Piranha Plant ink? It's no wonder those Koopas down the bottom look scared.</p>
<h3 id="yoshi-baby-mario-andamp-baby-luigi">Yoshi, Baby Mario &amp; Baby Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0b37fe21a2978"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b37fe21a2978/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The realistic T. rex model and waterfall-covered planet in the background have us wondering whether the Cascade Kingdom is joining Tostarena as another Odyssey cameo. It seems likely, no?</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-is-considering-a-switch-2-price-hike-this-year-according-to-new-report</link>
            <guid>1437448</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c2c025ed95807"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2c025ed95807/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rising demand for RAM for AI data centres and the associated rising costs are having a massive effect across the tech world, and with Sony reportedly pushing back the launch of its as-yet-unannounced PS5 successor, Nintendo is considering raising the price of Switch 2 in 2026, too, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">a new Bloomberg report</a> (paywall).</p>
<p>Speaking to "people familiar with its plans", Bloomberg reports that Sony is now eyeing 2028/29 for its next console hardware, and that Nintendo is looking at how to approach what the article says is being coined "RAMmageddon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">Niko Partners predicted</a> that Nintendo would be forced to follow suit and raise hardware prices as its competitors have.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the possibility of a price increase in an interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">back in January</a>, but refused to be drawn on plans at the time, saying "I cannot comment on hypotheticals".</p>
<p>With most tech firms reliant on memory and microchips produced by other companies, this precarious situation around RAM manufacturing has been a concern for some time now, with the crisis growing as AI-invested firms such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchase DRAM for data centres to drive chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Prices have been driven up at an alarming rate as demand outstrips component availability, with Bloomberg stating that the "cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January" alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, tech firms must choose between slimmer profit margins or raising prices in an already-fraught economic environment. The Switch 2's launch pricing and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price tag <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">proved controversial</a> with gamers in June last year, and Nintendo raised the price of all its Switch 1 hardware in the US <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">last summer</a>. Sony and Microsoft both <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-series-xs-how-their-prices-have-changed-over-the-past-five-years">raised their hardware prices recently</a>, with PlayStation getting a $50 hike on all PS5 models in the US <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/ps5-price-increases-confirmed-for-usa-effective-21st-august">last August</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have gotten its latest console to market ahead of full-scale "RAMmageddon", but it still has to keep the ball rolling and keep up production numbers. With the tech sector's reliance on RAM for almost everything and the AI bubble yet to burst, one thing is for certain: Switch 2 certainly isn't getting <em>cheaper</em> anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Are you tempted to push the boat out for a Switch 2 before it gets even more expensive? Happy you jumped in early? Let us know below.</em></p>

<p>The old "platform expansion", eh?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="955cbbc138351"><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/955cbbc138351/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen several ports come our way in the last eight months that would have been nothing more than a pipedream on Switch 1, and it looks like another title that got everyone talking on PS5 back in 2024 might make the jump to the new Nintendo hybrid, too.</p>
<p>We're talking about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, of course, the action-adventure title from Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up. In the developer's latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">financial report</a>, the team discussed what it hopes to see the game achieve in 2026, noting, "We are reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach. This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series".</p>
<p>Now, okay, there's no specific mention of Switch 2 in there, and the platform expansion is merely being <em>reviewed</em> at the moment, but if it's audience reach that Shift Up is after, we struggle to think of a better destination than Nintendo's latest.</p>
<p>"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," the note concludes.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade enjoyed PS5 exclusivity for the best part of a year before the PC version was released in June 2025. With its sequel now in development, it makes sense that the team would want to broaden its reach to attract as big an audience as possible, it just remains to be seen whether Switch 2 or a straight-up Xbox Series port is the way to do it.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more info this year, and will keep you updated with any juicy Switch 2 nuggets.</p>
