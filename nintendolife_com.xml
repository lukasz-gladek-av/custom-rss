<p>You and meme</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ah, the humble Metroidvania. We've seen more additions to this genre than we can count in recent years and now — with all other bases covered, presumably — even memes are being adapted into the format of non-linear exploration.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/this_is_fine_maximum_cope">This is Fine: Maximum Cope</a> takes KC Green's iconic dog meme and bends it into a metroidvania complete with perilous platforming, challenging bosses, nasty enemies and unlockable abilities. Oh yes, and it all takes place in the anxiety-riddled mind of the central character, Question Hound.</p>
<p>It launches on Switch in <strong>March 2026</strong>, promising adventures through five wild worlds of Humiliation, Fear, Failure, Loss, and Regret, plenty of collectibles, coffee sips and burning 'This is Fine' rest points — because of course.</p>
<p>We're not sure if we're completely sold on the above trailer's speed just yet; that said, the funny little dog animations are a nice touch, and we're getting hints of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a> from some of those grizzly-looking boss battles. Who knows, maybe memes make for great games!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore the landscapes, beat bosses, unlock abilities, and access new chapters. This is a metroidvania. As you platform your way through each world you’ll encounter enemies, each an embodiment of everyday worries. Through navigation and persistence, you will ultimately face the challenging bosses unique to every area. Defeat them and acquire the abilities needed to progress further (and explore previous areas in more depth)!</p>
<p>Be sure to stop at every burning Rest Point to save, sip coffee, and pretend everything is fine for a brief moment. Collect Coffee Beans as you explore; your currency used to purchase perks and refill your healing coffee cup. Keep your eyes peeled everywhere you go if your heart is set on finding every quirky collectible!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publisher Numskill Games and developer Hero Concept have also announced that a Switch physical version is on the horizon, so keep an eye out for more information on that one in the coming months if you want to add a bit of meme memorabilia to your shelf.</p>

<p>A post on his Facebook page originally confirmed this, and we've now got a translation (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DP3IAiqkhP-/?img_index=3&amp;igsh=MTRrOTdhMXFkNjRzbw%3D%3D">confirmed by James Mielke via social media</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last Words</p>
<p>The light of my life is finally fading.</p>
<p>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come. I am no longer in this world.</p>
<p>(I'm asking a loved one to make this final post.)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>My life has been a series of battles. I kept winning.</p>
<p>I've caused a lot of trouble, too.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that I followed my beliefs and fought to the end.</p>
<p>I have no regrets.</p>
<p>However, I'm filled with regret that I wasn't able to deliver a new work to all my fans. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's just how it is.</p>
<p>So, it goes.</p>
<p>Itagaki Tomonobu”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Koei Tecmo's Team Ninja has also issued an official statement <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606">on its social accounts</a>, mentioning how it will continue to "carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of <strong>Team</strong> <strong>NINJA</strong>'s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. Our deepest condolences for his loss. From everyone at Team NINJA"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various industry veterans have shared their own goodbye messages about Itagaki, including Tekken's <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978753604375736680">Katasuhiro Haruda</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> creator <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1978773161777766864">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/mortal_kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1978830801916633389">Ed Boon</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1978874636046598198">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/team-ninja-founder-and-dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away">Time Extension</a> note, "<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/01/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-reveals-decade-long-beef-with-tomonobu-itagaki-and-how-it-ended">in interviews</a>, Itagaki was never shy of being outspoken and sharing his honest opinions". In 2001, he also established a new studio and was gearing up to develop a new game.</p>
<p>Although Itagaki isn't connected to Team Ninja's new project, next week happens to mark the release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> – a collaborative effort with PlatinumGames and published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>
