<p>The music app is now a year old</p>

<figure data-uuid="577d025e97be0"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/577d025e97be0/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or not, one thing every racer should <em>probably</em> agree on is that this new entry has an amazing soundtrack. If you are wondering why Nintendo hasn't added this album to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> service just yet, we've now got an official response.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">The Washington Post [paywall]</a>, Nintendo's Bill Trinen acknowledged fan requests for this particular album, which is "particularly robust", and mentioned how soundtracks "actually take time and work" to prepare. It's also apparently about lining it up on the calendar and seeing if it fits. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t go into too much detail, but I can say that it does actually take time and work to prepare soundtracks for Nintendo Music. And that soundtrack is particularly robust. It’s a matter of looking at the calendar and saying whether something might fit in or not. We’ve certainly heard that people are eager to see that on Nintendo Music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Mario Kart World's album isn't available on this subscription service just yet, you can listen to existing Mario Kart soundtracks. It's now also been one year since this music app was released for mobile devices, and during this time, Nintendo has bolstered the service with all sorts of retro albums, as well as some sample collections for Switch 2 titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer something more physical, Nintendo yesterday announced it was teaming up with Laced Records to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">soundtrack on vinyl</a>. You can find out more in our previous post. Earlier this week, it also updated its digital music app with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> soundtrack.</p>

<p>In response to this, a response has been issued about the "current known issues and planned fixes" on the way. The fixes will be rolled out in a "future update" that's currently planned for November. For now, this is what you can expect, courtesy of the official Pokémon Legends Z-A news page.</p>
<p>One issue is tied to Pokémon Boxes, and the other is linked to side missions. Here's the rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59igvsqy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Current Known Issues and Planned Fixes (November, 2025)</h3>
<p>We have confirmed the following issues and plan to fix them in a future update.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your Pokémon Boxes become full before the first Rogue Mega Evolution battle and the Boxes menu had not been opened at any point prior to being filled, Pokémon catch attempts will always fail. Additionally, if a side mission that allows you to receive Pokémon is attempted under these conditions, the mission will be completed without granting the Pokémon.<br></li>
<li>In certain side missions, if the time of day switches between daytime and nighttime at the exact moment that a move hits its target, it will become impossible to hit the target afterward, rendering the side mission incapable of being progressed further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Planned Fixes</h3>
<p>These issues are scheduled to be fixed in the update planned for release in November.</p>
<hr>
<p>When this update and the patch notes are released, we'll provide an update. If you still haven't purchased this new entry yet, check out our reviews for the Switch 2 and Switch versions of the game here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Horrifyingly good</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has revealed a bunch of new information for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> ahead of its Switch 2 launch next year on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live via the Switch 2 eShop, with a standard edition priced at £64.99 / $69.99 and a deluxe edition at £74.99 / $79.99. The latter will grant you the following bonus features, while pre-orders for either edition will bag a special Grace: Apocalypse costume:</p>
<p>- Five costumes include Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu<br>
- Two filters including Filter: Apocalypse<br>
- Four weapon skins including S&amp;S Weapon Skin: Apocalypse<br>
- Two charms including Charm: Mr. Raccoon<br>
- Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic<br>
- Files: Letters from 1998</p>

<p>That's not all, though. A limited edition Resident Evil Requiem Pro Controller has also been revealed for the Switch 2. Launching on the same day as the game itself, it'll come in a gunmetal colour scheme and boast key iconography.</p>
<p>Later in the year, during Summer 2026, a Grace Ashcroft amiibo will also release for the Switch 2. Functionality has not been confirmed, and nor do we get to see exactly what it looks like just yet, but this is very exciting news for fans of amiibo.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fd3c807d273d7"><a title="Deluxe - RE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd3c807d273d7/deluxe-re.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>A new Resident Evil Showcase will take place at the start of 2026 offering up a deeper look at Resident Evil Requiem before its launch, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, those who enjoy keeping fancy boxes on their shelves will want to check out the 'Generation Pack', a special edition release containing Requiem alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> on Switch 2. All three games launch on the same day.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8cab2272a35a3"><a title="Generation Pack" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cab2272a35a3/generation-pack.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there you have it! Resident Evil fans are eating good, that's for sure. We're certain Capcom will have more surprises in store when the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary in the new year, so we'll be sure to keep you updated on any developments.</p>
