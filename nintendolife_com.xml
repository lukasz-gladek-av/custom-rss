<p>Bethesda has surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> fans on the Switch 2 this week with a new update, which adds a "60Hz mode" and allows players to prioritise either the game's visuals or performance. The frame rate has also been locked to 30Hz in the visuals mode, and the patch improves other aspects, such as the FPS performance drops in certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>The tech comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/Op5s6dTuod4">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has now taken a look at Update 1.2 - sharing a side-by-side video of the visual mode running alongside the game's performance mode. In some scenes, it's also shared footage of the existing update (Version 1.1, which was limited to 30fps).</p>
<p>While it might not look quite as impressive as it does in the visual mode, as you can see, the performance mode makes the experience smoother. According to this same video comparison, the game aims for 60fps in this mode, and while there is a solid frame rate in some segments, it can also be seen slightly dipping from time to time.</p>

<p>In terms of the compromises in performance mode, there appears to be less detail in terms of shadows and foliage. Other more noticeable things include more pop-in. Still, if you haven't already tried out this mode, it is worth a look, and might just end up being the mode you prefer playing on.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure if now is a good time to revisit (or jump into this title) on the Switch 2, we've shared our own <a href="https://youtu.be/0oU8yjp-m2Y">comparison video on Nintendo Life</a>, which you can see in our previous story covering the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bethesda-releases-skyrim-update-1-2-for-switch-2-includes-60hz-mode-and-much-more">patch notes for Skyrim's Update 1.2</a>.</p>

<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some adjustments on both the Switch and Switch 2. There are also some updates specific to the Switch 2 version of the game. This includes an issue with clouds that's now been resolved, and also an update to the controller vibration intensity.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Version 3.0.1 (18th February 2026)</h3>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the game would run slower than normal after exiting the island hotel to an outdoor area.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, when asking Resetti to clean up the island, fences that were put away or in storage could change into different customizations or be duplicated, and some cleaned-up items could disappear.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where Timmy and Tommy would sometimes stop following the player inside Nook’s Cranny.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where items could pop out of a rock before the shovel made contact when hitting it.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, after playing with another player on a slumber island, home remodeling or relocation could become unavailable on the slumber island.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the Camera app installation sequence could play when redeeming the Island Designer license at Nook Stop.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some items were displayed in incorrect positions in the catalog used for photo studios and hotel decorating.</em></li>
<li><em>Other adjustments and corrections were made to improve the game play experience.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where clouds near the horizon could appear misaligned outdoors on the island, causing parts of the sky to show unnaturally.</em></li>
<li><em>Adjusted controller vibration intensity to match the level when playing on Nintendo Switch.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, this follows the release of the Switch 2 Edition last month. If you haven't already got it, it's a paid upgrade for existing Animal Crossing Switch owners. Here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is perfectly fine. It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features, but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-free-3-0-update-2026-and-nintendo-switch-2-edition-everything-included">free 3.0 update</a> released alongside the Switch 2 release, which added new content and features to both versions of the game.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo also updated the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> this week.</p>

<p>This "bug fix patch" is available now in America</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="22a3a2ba7d30a"><a title="Stardew Valley" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22a3a2ba7d30a/stardew-valley.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of last year, the popular farming and lifestyle sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> got released on the Nintendo Switch 2 in the US.</p>
<p>The creator ConcernedApe has now rolled out the first major update for the title in 2026. It's a bug fix patch addressing multiple issues, including some improvements to mouse mode on Switch 2 and some fixes for GameShare.</p>
<p>Here is the full rundown via social media:</p>
<h3>Stardew Valley - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Update (19th February 2026)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fix for bug where crafting certain items could remove incorrect ingredients from the inventory.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Improved mouse mode on Switch 2, with the option to disable it entirely.</p>
<p>- Fixed some graphics corruption in Switch 2 GameShare.</p>
<p>- Ensure network maintenance messages appear on co-op startup.</p>
<p>- Obey parental controls when joining Switch 2 GameShare sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>ConcernedApe also notes how there is a patch for the game on the original Switch which fixes the same crafting bug.</p>
<p>The game's creator has also provided an update on the European and Japanese release of Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. These regions will apparently receive the game and upgrade on their respective eShops in "a few weeks". The bug fix patch above will also be included.</p>

<p>If you are eager to jump into the Switch 2 Edition, you can download the game or the upgrade from the North American eShop right now. To find out more about the Switch 2 Edition, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Missed Potential Or A Campy Classic? Switch 2 Exclusive 'Tokyo Scramble' Hasn't Been A Hit]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/missed-potential-or-a-campy-classic-switch-2-exclusive-tokyo-scramble-hasnt-been-a-hit</link>
            <guid>1439857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Cast your minds back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> earlier this month. One of the most surprising games featured during the presentation was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tokyo-scramble">Tokyo Scramble</a>, a stealth-horror hybrid where you have to escape from dinosaur-esque creatures. And you can do so alone or with the help of friends via GameChat and GameShare.</p>
<p>Not only was the announcement a surprise, but so was the release date — 11th February 2026, just less than a week after the Direct. Well, that's cool! Plus, the game was developed by one of the co-devs of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a>. Sounds interesting, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just a week after release, it seems like people aren't <em>too</em> hot on the game. We haven't managed to check it out ourselves, but looking at reviews and discussion online, opinions range to "a neat experiment" to "campy" to "very rough".</p>
<p>With only three critic reviews <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">on Metacritic</a> — all of which score the game at 5 or below — and an average score of <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble/reviews">37 on OpenCritic</a> (after 11 reviews), Tokyo Scramble's big reveal doesn't seem to have paid off.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://monstervine.com/2026/02/tokyo-scramble-review/">Monster Vine's Spencer Legacy's thoughts</a> on the main gameplay element, for example: "The stealth mechanics that serve as the very core of Tokyo Scramble are more irritating than compelling, especially since you die in a single hit." Technical issues and poor writing hampered what was otherwise a game with "some neat ideas", with the outlet landing on a 2/5 score.</p>
<p><a href="https://noisypixel.net/tokyo-scramble-review/">Azario Lopez over at Noisy Pixel</a> similarly sees the potential, but says Tokyo Scramble takes the "campy moments... too far". Again, mechanics, gameplay, and visual issues hinder the experience a lot, with Lopez concluding: "I respect the ambition behind trying something strange and new, especially for a fresh IP, but ambition alone doesn’t carry a game this far", scoring it a 4/10.</p>
<p>It's not <em>all</em> bad, of course; <a href="https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2026/02/analise-tokyo-scramble-sobrevivencia-e-drama.html">Fernando Lorde at Brazilian outlet Nintendo Blast</a> awarded the game a 7/10, praising that ambition, while acknowledging that (translated via Google): "it feels like a melting pot of ideas and mechanics lost in a feverish teenage dream about relationships and subterranean monsters."</p>
<p>Outside of reviews and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1r23fnb/so_i_bought_tokyo_scramble/">odd Reddit thread</a> about the game, online chatter seems pretty muted about the game overall. But the consensus seems to be that Tokyo Scramble is a swing and a miss for most, though if you like campy, ambitious experiences, you might find something to love.</p>

<p>Of course, we're just going by what others have said, so we'd love to hear from any of you lovely readers who have actually played the game — or are even a little bit interested in it! Do you think Tokyo Scramble is a misunderstood gem? Perhaps the camp and clunk have won you over? Or are you disappointed you jumped in head-first?</p>
