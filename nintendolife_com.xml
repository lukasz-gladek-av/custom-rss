<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e6c7f186c7aa/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in and the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has performed admirably, hitting the number 1 spot ahead of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have a couple more weeks or so to wait until the Switch 2 release, with Borderlands 4 scheduled to launch on <strong>3rd October</strong> on Nintendo's new console. It's difficult to say whether this early momentum spells good news for the Switch 2 release, but we'd wager the game probably won't sell half as much as it has on the PS5 (which commands 80% of the platform split).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> received its physical release, and although it's sitting fairly low down at number 25, the platform split just about favours the Switch at 52%. Jolly good.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Is &quot;Acting To Protect The Industry&quot; - Ex-Capcom Staffer Defends Switch 2 Game Key Cards 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0bc44a267aea/nintendo-is-acting-to-protect-the-industry-ex-capcom-staffer-defends-switch-2-game-key-cards-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since Switch 2 launched, one of the hottest topics has been Game Key Cards â€“ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-switch-2-game-key-cards-somehow-manage-to-make-codes-in-a-box-worse">physical items which unlock digital downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Critics have said Game Key Cards are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">anti-consumer</a>, and Japan's National Library has since decreed that they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/japans-national-library-says-game-key-cards-are-not-eligible-for-preservation">cannot be considered eligible for preservation,</a> which stands to reason, as the Game Key Card contains no actual game data.</p>
<p>However, a Ubisoft staffer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">recently explained</a> that one reason developers are choosing Game Key Cards is access speed. More recently, composer and former Capcom developer Masakazu Sugimori has waded into the debate on Nintendo's side (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-game-key-cards-and-pricing-are-not-about-greed-ex-capcom-dev-argues-they-are-acting-to-protect-the-industry/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1965252381219901629">Speaking on social media</a>, Sugimori argues that physical items don't have the longevity of digital ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do physical items outside of digital products last forever? Most of the time, they donâ€™t, right? Physical things always have a lifespan and will eventually break. Digital products, on the other hand, generally donâ€™t have a lifespan."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others would argue that digital items only last as long as they're available online, and we've seen many quite recent games <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/12/psa-xboxs-forza-horizon-4-will-be-delisted-in-less-than-one-week">removed from circulation by publishers</a> â€“ which shoots a hole in Sugimori's debate somewhat. However, he has a point; if digital games were made available forever, then they would certainly outlast physical games, which can be subject to wear and tear.</p>

<p>Sugimori also claims that Nintendo's Game Key Cards are also a measure "against illegal copying", as the data cannot be extracted from the cartridge and distributed online (it can still be extracted from the storage of the console it is downloaded to, of course). It also reduces the risk of Nintendo and other publishers holding excess inventory and potentially losing a lot of revenue, as Game Key Cards are far cheaper to manufacture.</p>
<p>"I feel that these moves are largely aimed at protecting the gaming industry and the digital entertainment industry," he concludes. "It might be a bit too optimistic of a view, but the fact is that because Nintendo takes the lead, other companies can more easily follow suit to protect themselves."</p>
<p>Greed is often cited as one of the main reasons for the Game Key Card initiative, but Sugimori disagrees on this point. "Do you think a company thatâ€™s already made that much profit would do this just to make even more money? Even if they stopped selling anything right now, they have enough cash reserves to support all their current employees until retirement (Itâ€™s so incredible itâ€™s almost ridiculous)."</p>
<p>Sugimori composed music for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_anthology">Ace Attorney</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> series during his tenure at Capcom, and left the company in 2007 alongside Atsushi Mori, Kento Hasegawa and Masato Kouda to form DesignWave.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise of the recent Direct was Nintendo's Virtual Boy announcement for the Switch Online service.</p>
<p>If that wasn't already enough for one week, the developer behind the indie sensation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> has now timed in its own announcement with this news, revealing it will be adding a dedicated 'VB mode' in the title's next major update.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown about this, along with how you'll be able to activate this mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summitsphere:</strong> "<em>AND</em>, we are very proud to announce that we are adding a VB mode in the next major <em>ANTONBLAST</em> update. You will be able to play the game in this mode by purchasing the Virtual Visor from Brulo's for a measly 770,000 casino chips. You can then turn it on and off at any time by accessing the "Goodies" menu from your pause screen. ...wait, what?"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FLqacb9dotM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4fd535rtxhng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLqacb9dotM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="EnergyFlow 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d45842bbb7505/energyflow-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the Switch 2 now in full swing, accessory manufacturers have unleashed a bevvy of additional bits and bobs for players to enhance their experience with Nintendoâ€™s new console.</p>
<p>JSAUX is one such company, and has released a rather lovely-looking charging dock for those who happen to own more than one set of Joy-Con 2 controllers. With an RRP of <strong>Â£19.99 / $25.99</strong>, is this something you should consider for your own setup? Letâ€™s take a closer look.</p>
<p>Focusing on the aesthetics to start, the EnergyFlow Charging Dock is a handsome bit of kit. Its elongated design almost reminds me of an Xbox Series X thatâ€™s been stretched out (though naturally this thing is significantly smaller), large enough to house up to four Joy-Con 2s.</p>

<p>The biggest draw is the RGB strip on the front. This lights up automatically when you connect the dock to a power source via the included USB-A to USB-C cable, but you can opt to turn it off by pressing the circular button located on the top of the device.</p>
<p>When itâ€™s on, the colours move downward, presenting a visual representation of energy flowing into your Joy-Con. Itâ€™s genuinely quite pretty, and Iâ€™ll admit to having it on in the background while Iâ€™m typing this very sentence. Although beyond the simple on/off functionality, there's no way to customise the light or change it while the Joy-Con are charging, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a specific aesthetic.</p>
<p>Attaching the Joy-Con to the dock is basically the same as the Switch 2 itself. Just snap them onto each side and youâ€™re good to go. Indentations on the top let you know which side is for the left Joy-Con and which for the right. Sounds obvious, but if you do get it wrong, they wonâ€™t charge. That said, they <em>do</em> work if you put them in the opposite sides upside down; so essentially, as long as the + and - symbols on the Joy-Con and the Charger align, you should be fine.</p>
<p>Green LEDs on the bottom of the device indicate which of the four slots is currently in use. By default, the lights will remain constant, but will start blinking when charging the Joy-Con. Once youâ€™re fully charged, all lights will stay lit, so youâ€™re good to remove them at this point.</p>

<p>When I first tested it out, I did wonder if the magnetic connection was perhaps a bit weak. You can pull the Joy-Con off with just a light yank, without having to bother pressing the pin in. Indeed, if you hold the dock on its side and shake it up and down a bit, the Joy-Con will fall out.</p>
<p>But to be honest, whoâ€™s going to be doing that? Ideally, youâ€™re going to be attaching the controllers and then just leaving it to charge. With that in mind, the magnetic connection is just about good enough, though I could also understand if you want something a tad more secure.</p>
<p>JSAUX claims that a full charge will take around 2.5 hours, and yeah, thatâ€™s about right after testing. Ultimately, if youâ€™ve only got the one pair of Joy-Con 2 controller, then youâ€™re not going to need the EnergyFlow Charging Dock. For those who might have already procured a few extras though? This is a solid option to make sure theyâ€™re consistently charged and neatly stored away.</p>
