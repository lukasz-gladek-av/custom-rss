<p>It's also got an fps boost on Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>When the 3D hand-drawn platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> made its debut on Nintendo platforms in June, we noted how there were some performance issues across both the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>It seems the developers have now acknowledged these issues in the latest game update by addressing the frame rate on both hybrid systems. On the Switch 2, you can now look forward to 60fps, and on the original device, you can generally expect "higher fps" than before.</p>
<p>This "huge" new patch also reportedly improves some other aspects of the game. This includes a "smoother camera" and "better combat". Here's the full rundown:</p>

<p>Here's what we had to say about the frame rate of this title on the Switch and Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Switch 1, the framerate struggles at times, mostly when the game transitions into new areas on-the-fly. Moving seamlessly across the world comes at a cost, it seems. It's a shame, and although they've not spoiled my enjoyment much, they are there and it'd be really nice to have a patch to sort this (and to add the old gyro).</p>
<p>For Switch 2 players, the performance issues present on Switch 1 do carry over to the newer console, and swapping between the two (bad puns flying out of me today), there's very little difference other than perhaps a slight improvement in loading times.</p>

<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows two players to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print of the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b4736719262f"><a title="Plants vs Zombies Replanted" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b4736719262f/plants-vs-zombies-replanted.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>
