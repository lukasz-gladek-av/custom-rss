<p>NS2 Edition Hyper Partying Redux Deluxe ++</p>

<figure><a title="Jamboree TV" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/741ab0351e614/jamboree-tv.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>With Donkey Kong still basking in the limelight a couple of weeks after the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> launched, you might have missed Nintendo's second first-party Switch 2 release to hit the eShop in as many weeks. Sure, it's more of an addendum to 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, but we consider the original the best entry in the entire series, and Jamboree TV only adds cherries on top of that cake.</p>
<p>PJ gave the updated game a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">in his review</a> last week. In fact, the silly title is pretty much the only thing we're not quite on board with. We would have loved to hear the folks on the old Nintendo Power podcast saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>" <em>every single time</em> it's mentioned. Rumours that the unwieldy NS2 Edition names are the reason they stopped the 'cast are entirely spurious. Probably.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2/critic-reviews/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 78</a>, so not everybody enjoyed it <em>quite</em> as much as PJ - and we're keen to hear what you think.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it just yet (hey, we get it, it's been a busy — and <em>expensive</em> — couple of months!), no sweat. Remember, you can come back at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, either here on Jamboree TV's game page, and it'll count towards the poll.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, you're a <em>particularly</em> lovely person and we salute you. If not, we still think you're lovely - feel free to drop your mark below. You know, if you like.</p>

<p>Total Digital Eclipse of the heart</p>

<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18dac4deea960/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been eagerly anticipating more news on Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-comes-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-2025">revealed</a> last month with a 2025 release window, and while nothing has been <em>officially</em> shared, it looks like a more specific release date might have accidentally leaked — via the Xbox App, no less (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-looks-like-its-been-leaked-early-by-xbox">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> Reddit forum, the Xbox App briefly had the upcoming collection listed for <strong>29th/30th September</strong> (thanks to the magic of time zones) over the weekend, though there was no official word from Digital Eclipse. The app listing has since reverted back to the 31st December 2025 placeholder that we so often see deployed for titles awaiting a specific date, but not before more than a handful of people clocked the change.</p>
<p>Speculation quickly ensued on the Reddit thread, with folks theorising that the devs might formally reveal the release date at EVO 2025 next weekend, or perhaps even that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumoured Nintendo Direct</a>. Either way, the specification of the app's date and its subsequent removal has made us a little less sceptical of this leak than we normally would be — even if we are still treating things with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>For those who missed the Legacy Kollection reveal in last month's State of Play, this one sees Digital Eclipse hit up the "interactive documentary" format once again, with interviews, commentaries and interesting materials about some of the biggest games in MK history. That accompanies "over 20 different versions" of iconic Mortal Kombat titles, with the current lineup including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat_ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a> and many more.</p>
