<p>It's scheduled to arrive in 2025</p>

<p>Masahiro Sakurai's latest project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> soars onto the Switch 2 at some point later this year.</p>
<p>While we haven't heard all that much about it since the initial announcement in April, the game has reportedly been rated in Saudi Arabia recently – receiving an age rating in this location of "7 and above" (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/31/kirby-air-riders-for-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-rated-in-saudi-arabia/">via My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Sakurai did provide a small update about this title earlier in July, mentioning how it was "shaping up to be something great". This also happened to be timed in with the 22nd anniversary of the original GameCube title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The classification for this title hopefully means a release isn't too far away. If this new Kirby racer does make its 2025 window, it will join other racing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo releases coming to the Switch this year include titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and the Koei Tecmo project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was featured during this week's Partner Direct.</p>

<p>The new entry arrives this October</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Battlefield 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b858208a5dbea/battlefield-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Switch 2 Partner Showcase</a> has just revealed what's ahead for the new hybrid platform in terms of third-party offerings, but it seems one series that won't be showing up any time soon is EA's popular military shooter Battlefield.</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke to Battlefield's head Vince Zempella as part of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI">multiplayer reveal today</a>, and it's been officially confirmed the company "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>The team is focused on delivering the game where the "core Battlefield audience is present", according to the same story.</p>
<p>EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">official FAQ for Battlefield 6</a> further confirms how the new entry, which launches on <strong>10th October 2025</strong>, will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (including the Steam, EA App, and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>Although EA won't be delivering Battlefield 6 on the Switch 2, earlier today the third-party giant announced it would be releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants Vs Zombies: Replanted</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, following a series of rumours. EA will also be bringing the latest entries in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> series to the new platform as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>This news about Battlefield follows on from Microsoft and Activision revealing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">would be released on Nintendo platforms</a> going forward.</p>
