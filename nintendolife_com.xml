<p>Launching as a Switch 2 exclusive in the West</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/disgaea-7-complete-is-launching-exclusively-on-switch-2-in-the-west">Western Switch 2 exclusivity</a> last month, NIS America has today lifted the lid on the release date for the upcoming definitive edition: <strong>10th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This 'complete' package arrived in Japan last year on PS5, PS4 and Switch, but only Nintendo's latest will be treated to the Western release (albeit as a Game-Key Card if you opt for the physical version).</p>
<p>For those who have missed it up until now, Disgaea 7 Complete bundles up the 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Vows of the Virtueless</a> strategy RPG base game and all of its DLC packs, gameplay tweaks like a new Hell Mode, max stats and more, <em>and</em> new characters and storylines. You can see it all for yourself in the above release date trailer.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Vows of the Virtueless when it arrived on Switch 1 a couple of years ago, calling it "another enjoyable entry in the long-running series, offering up a more refined take on the famously in-depth gameplay systems" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">our review</a>. The complete edition certainly seems like it'll be <em>the</em> way to play this one, and fortunately, we don't have too long to wait.</p>

<p>With mouse controls and 120fps, too!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Japanese developer ITL is returning to one of its DSiWare titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a>, and bringing it to the Switch 2 in just two days — on 31st July 2025 — for the bargain price of <strong>£5.00 / $7.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The original game launched as a DSiWare title back in 2010 and is a simple, neon-coloured air hockey game. However, it was exclusive to Japan. This version <em>looks</em> to be a polished-up version of the original, making it the first time it's available in the West.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itl.ne.jp/Products/HandyHockey/en/">the official website</a>, ITL confirms the game is entirely playable in Mouse Mode, and players can take one Joy-Con 2 each and use the mice to play against one another. Even cooler, you can place the Switch 2 screen on the table and play the game as though it were a real air hockey table.</p>
<p>Up to four players can take part in a match, and the game will also run at 120fps, making it one of the first games on the system to reach that cap.</p>
