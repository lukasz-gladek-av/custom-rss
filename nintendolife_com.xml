<p>If it's more than two, you're in the minority</p>

<figure data-uuid="fdc468f0f0474"><a title="Misc. Switch Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdc468f0f0474/misc-switch-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a die-hard Nintendo fan (and, if you find yourself here, then you probably are), you've more than likely questioned whether you're buying too many games. It's a thought that's crossed all of our minds, and new <a href="https://www.circana.com/">Circana</a> data suggests that if it's any more than two a year, then you're in the minority (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-buy-more-than-two-new-games-a-year-youre-in-the-minority-new-report-reveals">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The analyst firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">Mat Piscatella</a> recently took to BlueSky with the findings of the Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, which shows that 33% of gamers in the US pick up a new video game less than once a year. 12% of voters stated that they buy one roughly once a year, and 18% claimed to buy about one every six months.</p>
<p>What that means is that roughly 63% of gamers in the US buy less than two new games every year, so if you tend to buy more than that, you're in the minority.</p>
<p>"Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space", Piscatella noted of the findings. Interestingly, only 4% of voters said they buy more than one new game a month, with 10% opting for the 'once a month' slot, and 22% landing in 'About once every three months'.</p>

<p>Of course, the tendency to buy fewer games is hardly surprising. Since the Switch 2 launched, we've seen first-party titles get up into the reaches of £74.99 / $79.99, and with the price of <em>everything</em> on the rise, it makes sense that monthly pick-ups would take a step back. Throw in the rise of free-to-play titles and it's not hard to see how a trend could start.</p>
<p>But it got us thinking, where do you fall in this bracket? Are you like the majority of players in the US, where new game pick-ups are a rarity, or are you one of the ""Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" that Piscatella mentions, for whom new purchases are commonplace?</p>
<p>We'd imagine that most of us would sit closer to the latter (you've made it to the bottom of a post on <em>Nintendo</em> Life, so more than a passing interest in games seems likely), but there's only one way to find out... a poll! You can let us know your game purchasing habits below.</p>

<p>Available later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has announced a new event for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, introducing a special collaboration with <strong>Banshee's Last Cry</strong>, the obscure Super Famicom visual novel from 1994.</p>
<p>Players can access the new content via the World Tour mode by selecting the 'Street Fighter's Last Cry' option from the 'One Fateful Day' menu. What's even better is that this new content will seemingly be a permanent addition, and will be available even after the collab period ends.</p>
<p>Those who do join in the fun during the official period, however, will be able to bag exclusive items relating to the collaboration. That period is <strong>15th - 30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, we've got some spooky scenes with accompanying text to pay homage to the original Banshee's Last Cry, while the character models are also heavily influenced by the basic, blue design from the 1994 game.</p>
<p>It's a weird little addition, but we'll take it!</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 will also gain a new character in the form of C.Viper later this month as part of the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass. Alex and Ingrid will also join the ranks at a later date.</p>

<p>Starseekers Unite!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've already had a very brief glimpse of System Era Softworks and Devolver Digital's rather excellent-looking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker Astroneer Expeditions</a> during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Switch 2 Direct</a> six months back, and now the game has gone and got itself a great big 17-minute gameplay reveal, so we can get a proper look at exactly what it entails.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal video in full above, and following on from our initial excitement at what we gleaned from our first glance back in April (no thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/devolvers-awesome-new-games-got-lost-during-the-dodgy-switch-2-livestream">livestream hiccups</a>), this in-depth peek shows off a multiplayer space adventure that's got real promise.</p>
<p>The hook in Starseeker, you see, is all about getting together with other players, kicking off aboard the titular Starseeker ship before getting ready to drop out onto alien planets where, we assume, death dressed as many varieties of interstellar comedy awaits.</p>
<p>Of course, being a sequel to the also-very-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astroneer">Astroneer</a>, the game keeps the series' signature graphical style, although it does seem to have a lot more detail overall in the footage on show. We're also getting some heavy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/journey_to_the_savage_planet">Savage Planet</a> vibes from the colourful and goofy look of the planets on which players bound around and zap stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some further information about all of the gameplay aspects that you can check out in the vid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recruits begin their journey on the ESS Starseeker, an experimental space station packed with tools, supplies and the questionable leadership of the famous Action Science Hero superteam, the Fronteer Force. Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger cooperative missions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider our phasers officially set to "very interested indeed" as we await this one's 2026 release date on Switch 2.</p>
