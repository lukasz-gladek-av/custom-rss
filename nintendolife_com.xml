<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156612/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>We’re making this a trend now, huh? It’s never long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> makes its way onto the scene. Such was the case back in 2017 with the launch of the original Switch, when a worldwide release of 2014’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> (which released on Wii U and 3DS in Japan) served as one of the very first games available for Nintendo's then-fledgling hybrid.</p>
<p>It was arguably a ‘right place, right time’ moment for the crossover franchise, appealing to casual Tetris fans, puzzle game die-hards, and the massive influx of players just looking for more things to play on their shiny new system. Crucially, it helped reintroduce Puyo Puyo to the wider global market after a lengthy hiatus from localising the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, it seems Sega is aiming to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> — an enhanced port of 2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> — as one of the very first games available for Switch 2. Unfortunately, some bizarre choices within and surrounding this release prevent it from shining as bright as previous entries.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156613/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S takes the sequel that once more mashed the worlds of Puyo Puyo and Tetris and tosses in a handful of new features, many of which are designed to take advantage of Switch 2’s new functionality. That sounds like a pretty solid grab on paper, but a deeper dive into what’s <em>actually</em> new this time around leaves this re-release feeling unjustified.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Switch review of Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, Scully found it to be a worthy sequel crammed with ways to experience the titular two giants of the falling-block puzzle genre. That’s all still true in this version, which retains the original’s wealth of modes, unlockables, customisability options, and more. Whether it’s a simple alternating battle between Puyo Puyo and Tetris, a mode where miniscule Puyos drop from the sky, a fast-paced race to clear 40 rows in Tetris, or Skill Battles that completely change the game by introducing light RPG elements and abilities, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S does an excellent job keeping that simplistic core gameplay loop fresh and varied.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156616/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its replayability is bolstered by the Adventure Mode, which offers up a light-hearted story featuring the Puyo Puyo cast and a bunch of levels to chew through, as well as its multiplayer modes, which turn it into quite the entertaining party game for the right crowd.</p>
<p>In contrast to all of that juicy returning content, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds just a single new mode: Puyo Tetris Doubles. This introduces 2v2 battles to the mix, in which each team must control and drop two Puyos or Tetriminos simultaneously on the same board. Critically, your pieces have collision physics with one another, meaning you need to carefully coordinate with your partner to stay out of each other’s way and drop the pieces in the right places.</p>
<p>It’s a solid addition that can lead to some fun multiplayer chaos, as you desperately beg your friend to please, <em>please</em>, get their annoying square block out of the way so you can nail a T-spin in just the right place.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156619/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that said, Puyo Tetris Doubles mode feels like a small addition to the greater scheme of the game. This sentiment only grows stronger when considering that the mode is limited to a select number of game styles (Versus, Party, and Fusion) and that you absolutely need other players for it to be any fun at all. While Puyo Tetris Doubles can be played with CPU partners and opponents, you’ll be banging your head against a wall trying to wordlessly coordinate with the AI. As such, single-player gamers are effectively left out in the cold when it comes to just about any substantial new content in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.</p>
<p>Outside of the one new multiplayer-centric mode, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is pretty light on enhancements. The game certainly looks better on the new hardware, with a resolution bump to keep things looking nice and crisp, and it runs buttery smooth. This version also adds native GameShare and GameChat support, letting you share your copy of the game wirelessly and online with friends.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the incorporation of the Switch 2’s new camera and mouse mode abilities. Players can use a connected camera to superimpose their face on various parts of the board during gameplay — a fun, if ultimately superfluous, little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156617/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don’t have anything as kind to say about the new mouse controls, which feel genuinely awful and imprecise for Puyo Puyo and Tetris gameplay compared to traditional gamepad input. Your mileage may vary, but it feels distressingly reminiscent of the shoehorned touch and waggle gimmicks that plagued the DS and Wii days. The only saving grace in my eyes is that it’s purely an optional input method and can be viewed as a weird little novelty.</p>
<p>And, well…that’s it. Aside from a few other minute adjustments to the experience, the features outlined above are really the only new things available in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. The game feels like it was just <em>slightly</em> updated and tweaked for release on Switch 2 compared to its Switch incarnation, which makes Sega’s release and pricing strategy for this title all the more baffling.</p>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S continues Sega’s frustrating trend of not offering any sort of upgrade path for its Switch 2 games. Just as with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>, you’ll need to purchase the Switch 2 version of the game at full price, even if you own a copy on Switch 1. There may be some reason to do that for the other aforementioned titles, which see substantial performance bumps on Switch 2, but that’s not the case for Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. This new version is barely any different from the original release and offers <em>very</em> little to anyone who played Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 the first time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156614/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even beyond the egregious pricing strategy, dividing Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S from its non-enhanced counterpart feels like a misstep that could seriously affect the longevity of this game from a multiplayer perspective. There’s no crossplay between the titles, which means that the online experience and player base are even further segmented than before. In the days immediately after launch, I tried multiple times to find any online matches and failed to find an opponent every single time. That could potentially improve as more people dive into the Switch 2 ecosystem in the days ahead, but it feels like a dark omen for this version’s community and future.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>More than most, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a tough release to put a score on. Under no circumstances is it a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, I struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Altogether now! <em>"This should have been a pack-in."</em></p>
<p>Or, if that simply wasn't on the table, free for the first year. Or free with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. It's painfully obvious to everybody but Nintendo that paywalling this specific software further behind the already-pricey console is a mistake.</p>
<p>And it's a real shame that more people won't experience it, because it makes you feel good about your sizeable investment in the hardware. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a peaceful, in-depth exploration of the system, taking you around and inside the device, its controllers, and peripherals (some sold separately - more on that later), and highlighting its various features and novelties. This is the platform holder celebrating and deep-diving into its tech in a way that feels unusual but also <em>very</em> Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156634/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the granular tech focus here is a necessity. Switch 2, by its nature, is an iteration on a theme, so if you're going to charge a hefty sum for something superficially 'the same but bigger', what better way than to highlight <em>every single</em> upgrade in a fun, demo-filled game of hide-and-seek that breaks it all down?</p>
<p>And the devs really do break it <em>all</em> down. You'll be running around capacitors, over circuit boards, batteries, and myriad chips and components that appear to be modelled extremely faithfully. This is Nintendo tearing down its hardware virtually so you don't have to, and being remarkably frank in some regards. There are various examples of 'we did our best' while discussing the challenges faced with, for instance, dispersing heat and optimising battery longevity. There's no console-wars chest-beating here; it's all very self-effacing. It's essentially an Iwata Asks/Ask the Developer interview in game form.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156648/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game itself takes the form of an explorative, isometric walking-sim affair. You control a person jogging (or running if you hold down 'B') around an oversized Switch 2 and accessories propped up and exhibited across an enormous park. Or are you tiny and the Switch normal-sized? It's never made clear, but hot Welcome Tour lore aside, you run around the virtual gear while the real-life gear throws novel audio-visual and haptic feedback at you. It's a particularly great showcase for HD rumble 2 - I only hope that devs take the time to implement it properly in other games.</p>
<p>Stamp Rally plinths pop up when you approach components and gate progress between areas. So, to get to the main console, you have to locate 18 stamps on the left Joy-Con, and so on. Simple enough, though some less obvious ones do present a challenge, usually when the button or port is on the inaccessible underside and you're hunting for the plinth.</p>
<p>Then there are the minigames, with multiple variations of the same game grouped on little exhibits across the hardware. It's all very 'Switch 2 Experience' for anybody who attended those pre-launch events. There are over 50 games and beating them earns medals to unlock harder variants.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156635/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some, naturally, are better than others. The Mouse Mode ones are <em>generally</em> more challenging and/or frustrating. Removing stains with a paint scraper was much harder on my leg or the arm of the sofa than on a table (where I donned the Joy-Con straps and got the medals first try); my lap or a cushion worked fine with other games, though. If you do hit a wall with one, just move on. You're able to instantly warp to anything you've visited by hitting 'X' to bring up the menu and selecting it, a real godsend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you'll be hunting floating pixels, shooting balloons, colouring within the lines, guessing the angle of the kickstand - all sorts. Only one minigame — Breaststroke: Floaty Frustration — is outright bad (it lives up to its name), and while there's nothing here you're likely to fire up again once you've completed the game, they're all effective at demonstrating the possibilities of your shiny new console.</p>
<p>On that theme, and beyond the realm of proper 'games', 14 tech demos highlight neat functions and features, letting you test the noise reduction qualities of the built-in microphone, make the Joy-Con emit sound effects, and plenty more. The 3D Sound demo with the helicopter is a particular highlight, but they're all fun to mess around with. My kids absolutely loved sawing logs, shaking maracas, and hearing themselves with robot voices. The HDR demo didn't wow me, but these are cool toys to play with. Who wouldn't want to rev a motorbike with a Joy-Con?</p>

<p>Beyond <em>that</em>, dozens of info desks contain multiple-choice quizzes testing your knowledge of nearby Insight boards. It's here where Nintendo goes into detail about the hows and whys of design, and in all honesty, it's incredibly interesting for anybody with a penchant for gaming hardware.</p>
<p>The light-hearted quiz questions aren't taxing if you're paying any attention whatsoever to the slides, though it's fun to imagine a world where 'Love' or 'Glue' hold the Joy-Con on. They do get progressively more challenging as you journey inside the console, but there's typically one comedy answer, two vague possibilities, and the obvious correct one. Get a question wrong and the relevant Insight board is flagged, so you can quickly swot up and repeat.</p>
<p>Burning through Insights for review isn't the best way to digest them, and they got repetitive towards the end. One named 'Games Use Electricity' isn't as blindingly obvious as it sounds, but the title made me guffaw. You're not obliged to do any of the quiz stuff, either, and along the way there's lost property to find, some charming NPC writing, cute moments as you skate across the screen, and a bunch of nostalgic nods to Nintendo history.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also some smirk-worthy 'purely for reference' disclaimers when they show animations of the Joy-Con being wrenched from the console and other non-sanctioned actions, but Welcome Tour feels like Nintendo being refreshingly open and surprisingly confident. I can't imagine any other platform holder going into this sort of forensic detail for fear of a red-ring-level embarrassment down the line. It might even help allay fears about another Joy-Con drift debacle this gen, as the new mechanisms feature very prominently here.</p>
<p>There's an assuredness in inviting this kind of scrutiny; an admirable pride in the work. "I can't believe they're showing us as much as they are," says one of the milling NPCs, and I can only agree. It's a quality product.</p>
<p>And a surprisingly lengthy one. Due to the weird 10-day delay before playtime data is shown on your profile, I can't say exactly how many hours I've spent opening everything and getting nearly all the medals, but it's got to be seven or eight (and at least one of those was spent on the nightmare dual-mouse UFO bullet hell/star collection minigame). There are 12 'areas' in all, going from the top of the left Joy-Con into the system itself via the dock, the Joy-Con grip and straps, and even peripherals that don't come with the system - specifically the Camera, the Pro Controller, and the Joy-Con wheels.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156636/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don't own those things? You can still earn 'fast-track medals' from them via a cute little SOS trick, so progress isn't gated behind them. However, access to a handful of minigames and demos <em>are</em> effectively blocked if you don't have the requisite gear (the Camera, a pad which has the 'GL'/'GR' buttons, and a 4K TV).</p>
<p>For me, it's nothing to get too upset about — there's so much else to be getting on with, and what's the alternative? Remove those experiences entirely? — but it's <em>another</em> straw on the camel's back if you're already irritated by the cost. It also highlights another unavoidable aspect of Welcome Tour: as well as being part instruction manual, part demo, it's also an ad for those lovely accessories you <em>didn't</em> pick up. Yet.</p>
<p>There's an undeniable allure to seeing pristine hardware at this resolution, too, without the skin cells and dust particles and pet hairs and assorted household detritus that attaches itself the moment you remove the packaging. Welcome Tour is deliciously, fetishistically sterile, with gorgeous specular highlights on the logos as you run across them, close-ups of glistening ports and shiny sticks. It tickles the same zones as Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a> in some ways, though this is much more of a museum piece.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156641/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It does a fantastic job of highlighting the design chops and consideration that goes into every aspect of Nintendo's products, from the 0.05mm height adjustments to individual face buttons to the minuscule tab on a single foot of the dock that means it will slide (rather than topple over) if you accidentally yank it with a cable connected.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Welcome Tour is modestly priced ($9.99 / £7.99), too, despite the wider economic context surrounding Switch 2's launch and the general upset over pricing across the industry which makes charging for it feel like the last straw. For your buck, there's a surprising amount of bang, though.</p>
<p>So, one more time, then: <em>This 100% should have been a pack-in.</em> But the software itself? It's great.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Welcome Tour is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p></section>

<p>Miyamoto doesn't even get a "special thanks"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fans Have Noticed Someone's Name Is Missing From Mario Kart World's Credits 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0139ff4fd04ab/fans-have-noticed-someones-name-is-missing-from-mario-kart-worlds-credits-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous video game designers the world has ever seen and is responsible for giving us classic franchises such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-super-mario-games-of-all-time">Super Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-zelda-games-of-all-time">Zelda</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pikmin-games">Pikmin</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-star-fox-games-of-all-time">Star Fox</a>.</p>
<p>One of his most critically and commercially successful creations is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart</a>, a series that has sold in excess of 189 million copies worldwide since its inception in 1992 with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>.</p>
<p>However, it has been noted that his name is completely absent from the credits for the latest entry in the franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>:</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Miyamoto hasn't been credited in a Mario Kart game—his name is also missing from the smartphone release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>—but this is the first mainline instalment which doesn't appear to have had any input from the legendary designer.</p>
<p>You may recall that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-shigeru-miyamoto-apparently-isnt-credited-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">his name didn't feature</a> in last year's Zelda game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, either.</p>
<p>On one level, this isn't all that surprising; Miyamoto has shifted into an advisory role with a wider scope in recent years, as befits his senior standing within Nintendo. However, it does feel odd not to see his name appear in the credits, even as a "special thanks".</p>
<p>Were you expecting to see Miyamoto's name in the game's credits? Let us know with a comment below. And if you're interested in seeing those credits for yourself (as seen when you complete the Special Cup), check out this video:</p>

A non-Switch 2 game?!? Variety, my friends, is the spice of Nintendo Life...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A goofy life sim set in a physics-based sandbox, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wobbly_life">Wobbly Life</a> by RubberBandGames is an entertaining amalgam of open-world adventure and indie party games. With its cartoonish tone and compulsive gameplay, it's clearly targeting younger players, but buckets of charm make it just as enjoyable for adults.</p>
<p>You play as a hapless Wobbler who is unceremoniously kicked out of their home by Grandma. Told to stop playing video games, get a job, and buy a house, your character is nothing if not relatable.</p>
<p>The whole island and its surrounding biomes are open to you from the beginning. Navigating this vast space and becoming a successful Wobbler forms the core loop of the game's World mode.</p>
<p>To earn enough money to become a homeowner and appease your overbearing grandma, you'll need to take on a variety of part-time jobs scattered across the map. Some of these are simple, like picking up taxi fares within a generous time limit. Others are a calculated test of patience and precision.</p>

<p>You start small, by picking up odd jobs around the neighbourhood. The first of these tasks is to fetch jelly from the supermarket and deliver it to a neighbour. Simple enough, right? The challenge becomes apparent when you realise that every inhabitant on this island is a stiff, humanoid blob. Lugging that tutorial jelly around quickly becomes a lesson in the game’s unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>Your Wobbler animates with the same awkward, floppy physics as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> contestant, which makes even mounting a small pavement something that needs prior calculation. Every task on Wobbly Island is subject to the janky hobble of your character and the erratic motion of the objects they manipulate.</p>
<p>Each of your Wobbler’s arms is controlled by the left and right triggers. Holding in the triggers will thrust an appendage out and stick onto any surface they make contact with. Most tasks require you to grab and transport items to specific locations, demanding careful coordination. Certain jobs, such as the hamburger chef, introduce an extra layer of challenge by requiring quick, responsive management of your grip and the momentum of ingredients.</p>

<p>It takes some getting used to, and much of the game’s comedy stems from fumbling through this process. Wobbler arms stick to any surface, resulting in awkward accidents, like trying to pick up a well-caught fish, only to realise you're fused to the floor.</p>
<p>While the game is perfectly playable solo, most of its mechanics and minigames are clearly designed to be tackled as part of a group. Many of the part-time jobs involve driving around with some form of cargo, from pizzas to nuclear waste. Doing this alone is often laborious, and sometimes outright impossible. Earning money and taking on jobs with others transforms irritation into entertainment.</p>
<p>The multi-stage nature of the minigames demands self-organisation and stress management, much like in popular friendship destroyers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/overcooked_all_you_can_eat">Overcooked</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moving_out">Moving Out</a>. There's splitscreen local co-op for up to four players and all modes can be played online, so there’s plenty of ways to live that wobbly life together.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156447/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing alongside others makes earning money a breeze. If you all work together, some of the more difficult jobs — like firefighter or paramedic — get a lot easier to manage. It's a shame that fishing is the best money earner in the early game, because it's also the most sedate and requires little cooperation.</p>
<p>Outside of the impressive open world, which is jam-packed with secrets and activities — not least the endless clothing combos and pets — there's an arcade that pits Wobblers against each other in three competitive modes. Hide and Seek is self-explanatory, while Trash Zone has Wobblers competing to throw garbage into a compactor. The best arcade title is Wobble Run, which is a thinly veiled copy of Fall Guys. These modes are a worthy distraction when you get tired of the Island rat race.</p>
<p>Capping off the arcade suite is Sandbox mode, which places Wobblers in an open arena with the freedom to experiment with the game's assets. The near-endless possibilities offered here should vastly increase the longevity of this game beyond its other modes.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156452/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One small caveat emerges when playing with a full local party: Joy-Con control. Wrestling with the deliberately stiff and erratic physics on the smaller controller is a physically demanding experience. Little ones will be fine, but adults with full-sized appendages should expect some cramp.</p>
<p>Other than that small physical niggle, Wobbly Life is lighthearted fun for all ages. There is so much to do in the open world, including a bonkers story mode and a wealth of customisation options. Pile on a bunch of other ways to play and this is a generous package wrapped up in a silly bow.</p>
<p>It can be a bit of a slog when played solo, but this game is clearly designed from the ground up to be enjoyed with friends and family. Pro tip: If you're the type of player who gets tired of your bickering party, just hit the ragdoll button and go limp. Let them carry you for a change.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wobbly Life isn't doing anything new with the physics-based party genre, but it offers tons of content and a great time for all ages. The arcade and sandbox modes will keep you coming back long after life on Wobbly Island gets boring.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, you! Wrap up that Knockout Tour, it's time for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>ing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes-dreamcast">Last week</a>, we hopped over to the Dreamcast and took a look at three different covers for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a>. While there was a decent spread of votes, it was the Japanese variant that walked away with the win, taking 55% of the vote and leaving North America and Europe with the remaining 31% and 14%, respectively.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something vaguely related to the Switch 2-shaped elephant in the room this time, but we've covered just about every launch title in previous Brawls. Then it hit us. A Nintendo console launching with a <strong>Street Fighter</strong> game? Where have we seen that before?</p><p><figure data-videoid="dFHTTcnGF1w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFHTTcnGF1w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3937a0rogjil&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFHTTcnGF1w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Sure, some of you might be tucking into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2 this weekend, but we're thinking about the <em>last time</em> the series graced a Nintendo launch line-up as we take a look at the 3DS' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for very similar designs on this one, so it's a good old-fashioned face-off against the Japanese variant. Let's meet the fighters, shall we?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:15042 @ 1749396143 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99a6e64f48892/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American / European design is pretty badass, we'll admit. Ryu takes centre stage, naturally, but we like how the rest of the roster extends out behind him, each reimagined in an almost hand-sketched art style. The sepia tones are throwing us off a little bit, but we're suckers for a giant floating head in the sky, and this design has three of 'em!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6b989477c851/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese artwork goes for something slightly different. The hand-drawn aesthetic has been dialled up a couple of notches, though the previous roster has been replaced with close-ups of Ryu, Chun-Li and Akuma, while Juri and Guile loom in the background. It's a little less cohesive than the last design, but we like the action poses.</p>

<figure><a title="Splatoon 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bae9f7be2982/splatoon-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has gone to the extent of providing a series of free upgrades for select Switch titles on the Switch 2, and it's even rolled out updates for other first-party games, but it seems one other title might need a look.</p>
<p>According to reports, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> community has discovered a new bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> on Switch 2 – allowing squid kids to "squid roll" on "any surface, regardless of if it is inked in your colour". This was originally shared by a user known as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/diolass.bsky.social/post/3lqyctc7ylk2e">'Diolass' on Bluesky</a>, who described it as "game-breaking" on the competitive front.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12egkwjnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>While it's not clear why exactly this is happening, dataminer 'OatmealDome' speculates it "might be an issue with Switch 1 GPU emulation/translation since Splatoon games have had issues with ink detection in unofficial emulators due to bugs in their GPU emulation".</p>
<p>Switch 2 backward compatibility obviously still has some issues, with Nintendo officially releasing a list of games with issues and titles in the process of being fixed. Even some apps like YouTube aren't available at launch.</p>
<p>If we hear about any updates or patches for Splatoon 3 on the Switch 2, we'll let you know. How are you finding this series on Nintendo's new system so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Retro game collections are all the rage nowadays and following in the footsteps of classic mascots like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy</a> are now Joe and Mac.</p>
<p>This new package, officially titled <strong>Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection</strong>, is slightly different as it's a Kickstarter project scheduled to go live on <strong>10th June</strong> (aka next week) and is expected to release later this year digitally on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>It will contain the following three 16-bit Super Nintendo releases from Data East:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> (<em>ジョーとマック 戦え原始人</em>) is a Run &amp; Gun platformer that follows the titular Joe &amp; Mac as they fight through 12 hellish levels using prehistoric (but not just) tools and weapons. While the game was censored when it came out in the West, the Retro Collection also includes the original Japanese version!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/congos_caper">Congo's Caper</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Congo's Caper</em> (<em>戦え原始人2 ルーキーの冒険</em>) is a side-scrolling Action platformer centered around Congo, a half-human, half-monkey boy looking to rescue his girlfriend from a demon through 35 varied levels."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac_2_lost_in_the_tropics">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Joe &amp; Mac: Lost in the Tropics</em> (<em>ジョーアンドマック戦え原始人3主役はやっぱり</em>) adds a light roleplaying aspect to the series. While the goal is still to defeat cavemen and dinosaurs, players can court and wed their Stone Age girlfriend, and even have a child with her!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this collection is comprised of games released here in the West in the early 90s (1991 - 1995) as well as the "uncensored" Japanese versions.</p>
<p>There'll also be "multiple new features" including quality-of-life improvements like the ability to rewind gameplay, save states, customisable aspect ratios, a CRT filter, local co-op for Joe &amp; Mac 1 and 2, and "cool new visuals and merchandise" to go with this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>This campaign is led by G-Mode, Red Art Games and their "award-winning internal studio" Red Art Studios. If you're curious to revisit this prehistoric franchise there are also multiple options on the Switch, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/joe_and_mac">Nintendo's Switch Online Classics</a> game library.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch YouTube" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7edc3f06932f9/nintendo-switch-youtube.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 supports existing apps and games, but out of the gate you might experience some issues. If you've been trying to access <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a> on your new Nintendo system you'll receive a notice about how the software is unable to start.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering if it will make a return, Nintendo has already flagged this in its backward compatibility tests, noting how the issue with YouTube is "being investigated". In an update, a user of this app has reached out to <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931203116126351639">YouTube via social media</a> and received the following response.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nurqzl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>YouTube asks Switch 2 users to "stay tuned" for updates, so for now, you're going to have to go without this popular video app on your Switch 2. There are various other video players and apps that also don't work on the Switch 2 right now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-updates-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list">as revealed in a recent update</a>. This includes Niconico, ABEMA, Hulu, Crunchyroll and InkyPen.</p>
<p>YouTube originally made its debut on the Switch eShop as a free app in 2018 and was also previously available for the Wii U, 3DS and Wii.</p>

Wonder</a> in 2023 marked a new era for the character, with the legendary voice actor Charles Martinet officially replaced by Kevin Afghani as Mario. It led to questions at the time about what other voices might be swapped out in the future.</p>
<p>While Peach's voice actor Samatha Kelly returned in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> the following year, it seems she's now been replaced after 18 years. This also includes her role as Toad. According to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">post on her Instagram</a> account, the voice actor found out yesterday after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had been released.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MZ5pbSbsoJA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41ed20zvxkoj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ5pbSbsoJA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Samantha Kelly:</strong> "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I’m sad that it’s over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I’m grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love #princesspeach #toad"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Kelly was in the role for nearly two decades (and voiced various other Mario characters during this time) her departure has obviously been far less public than Charles Martinet, who was given an official send-off by Nintendo and crowed the title of "Mario Ambassador" – going on to promote the character at events.</p>
<p>In some other news, it appears Takashi Nagasako is also reportedly no longer voicing Donkey Kong after 20 years. You can see the latest Mario voice actor update in <a href="https://youtu.be/gyHq-wRvmds?si=-6M4eE5mwCU_csyB&amp;t=47">Mario Kart World's credits</a>.</p>

<p>"Mario Kart World is going to move a lot of Switch 2"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has the most graphical horsepower we've ever seen in the history of the Mario Kart series, and if you're eager to know the exact details about how this game is performing on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has now delivered its tech review.</p>
<p>In the Switch 2's portable and tabletop mode, racers can expect a resolution of 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TV image quality is generally fine...holding up well on a 4K television set from a typical viewing distance. Docked mode also gets a touch of post-process image treatment to adjust the 1440p resolution...handheld mode fairs a bit better though, despite its lower pixel count. There's no anti-aliasing of any kind here, so the 1080p pixel count maps perfectly onto the 1080p Switch 2 display."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> was 1080p docked and 720p in portable mode. This results in World looking a "lot cleaner" even if it is still imperfect.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance, Digital Foundry found its experience to be "faultless" - with the frame rate locked at 60fps in the content tested, although photo mode drops the experience to 30fps. On the portable front, it's believed to run at the same frame rate as its docked counterpart.</p>
<p>The team also tested out the split screen as well as the GameChat functionality and found there weren't any performance concerns to the player experience. Regarding load times, these were also "fairly speedy" on the system's internal storage and comparable to a lot of current-generation titles.</p>
<p>HDR is also a nice addition and while it looks decent on TVs, don't expect much from the LCD panel in portable mode. All up, though, Digital Foundry sums up this next-generation entry as a "tremendous accomplishment" and is seriously impressed by the scope of what's been achieved here in terms of the massive open-world scale with very few compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visually speaking, World offers some beautiful sights with key rendering advances over prior Mario Kart games, though a lot of rendering power has gone into making the open world work. It's really the incredible quality of Nintendo's artistry that stands out the most here...plus it packs good resolution and frame rate metrics in portable and docked play without the low internal resolutions that typify a lot of early Switch 2 software."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
