<p>Primarily, the unlocked frame rate rarely manages to hit that 60fps sweet spot, resulting in some horrible stuttering that's far more prevalent in docked mode thanks to the VRR technology in handheld mode. Thankfully, developer IO Interactive is aware and is looking to address these issues very soon.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wjklvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>, IO is hoping to issue a fix for the performance issues "over the Summer". Bit of a vague timescale, we're sure you'll agree, but it gives the dev some wiggle room if it needs a bit of extra time. It didn't elaborate on exactly what the fix would entail, but a spokesperson said that "the team is working on some of those performance issues right now", suggesting that the frame rate issue specifically would be high up on the team's list of priorities.</p>
<p>It also stated that these learnings would be applied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, which is scheduled to launch on Switch 2 in 2026. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/007-first-light-official-game-reveal-launching-on-switch-2-in-2026">official announcement</a> for the game arrived last month, with a full gameplay reveal scheduled to take place this Summer.</p>
<p>Whatever comes from the planned update, we're excited to see what kind of improvements it brings. We don't know about you, but we're eager to dive back into Hitman: World of Assassination. The only thing holding us back right now is that darn frame rate.</p>

<p>Well, that escalated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Repair firm iFixit has performed a full teardown of the Switch 2's Pro Controller, delivering a scathing review of the repairability and potential durability of the accessory. Ultimately, it calls the Pro Controller a "p**s-poor excuse for a controller".</p>
<p>But why? Well, watching the video reveals just how tricky it is to actually get into the Pro Controller, with Nintendo applying adhesives to the front faceplate, lots of hidden screws, and thumb-grips that need "an uncomfortable amount of force to remove". Essentially, iFixit believes that the work required to simply reach the controller's battery for potential replacement is far too difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have the potential issue of stick drift. iFixit believes the potentiometer stick technology used in the Switch 2's Pro Controller means it will likely still be prone to drifting. That said, it says that the sticks themselves are slightly easier to remove than that of the original Switch Pro Controller.</p>
<p>As for the good news (if you can call it good news), the headphone jack is fully modular and easily removable. In fact, iFixit says that this is probably the only positive that it can muster when it comes to assessing the Pro Controller.</p>
<p>In conclusion, iFixit points to cheaper controllers such as the <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1443193.html">Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit</a> as accessories that accomplish much more at a lower price, including the additions of TMR and Hall Effect sticks.</p>
<p>Now, in practice, the Pro Controller for the Switch 2 is astoundingly comfortable to use, with excellent-feeling sticks and a strong d-pad. However, as time goes on and more folks find the need to repair their controllers, it seems Nintendo has made it about as difficult as possible to actually get into the bloomin' things.</p>

<p><em>Gosh, that was brutal. What do you think, dear readers? Are you bothered about this, or are you happy with how the Pro Controller performs when in use? Let us know.</em></p></section>
