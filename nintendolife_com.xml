<p>Last month, Nintendo brought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to the SNES Nintendo Switch Online Library, finally unlocking the Mouse Mode experience we had all been dreaming of. It was a neat addition, no doubt, but there was something missing in diving back in on our shiny new Switch 2s, something that could only be achieved by playing a second-hand copy of the game on its original hardware: save files.</p>
<p>By playing on NSO, our games were all squeaky clean, with no sign of any pre-existing blast-from-the-past artwork. We're not claiming that we used to be '<em>artists</em>' on the SNES back in the day, but there's something sweet about looking back over old drawings, right? It gives us a peek into a different time, where abilities and priorities couldn't get in the way of putting virtual pen to virtual paper. Ah, to reminisce...</p>
<p>The lovely Zion over on our video team obviously felt the same way and took on the behemoth task of collecting a whopping 100 copies of Mario Paint on the SNES, just to search for any hidden gems on the cartridges. It was a serious undertaking (like, $500 and <em>a lot</em> of time 'serious'), but the results were... well, you'll just have to watch the video to find out!</p>
<p>Above, you'll find Zion's journey to reaching the big 100 (accompanied by some sweet art by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guppies.bsky.social">@Guppies</a>), and get a look at what he uncovered along the way. It's a long one, so grab yourself a brew and settle in for some cosy nostalgia.</p>
