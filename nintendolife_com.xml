<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160759/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developers Purple Lamp Studios are single-handedly keeping the dream alive for the continuing adventures of everyone's favourite sentient sponge.</p>
<p>2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated</a> was a fine update to a cult classic and a huge success to boot. The studio followed up with a solid sequel in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a>, making good on the promise to continue the franchise.</p>
<p>We now have another adventure from that same template with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">Titans of the Tide</a>, a familiar adventure that is fun for all ages and preserves the universal appeal of its source material.</p>
<p>The story is about as simple as an average episode of the show. King Neptune and the Flying Dutchman get into a seismic squabble in the Krusty Krab, and the denizens of Bikini Bottom end up caught in the crossfire. Undersea inhabitants are turned into slime-throwing spectres and Squidward has something else to complain about. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up to battle the Dutchman's army of monsters and save the day. How else is Mr Krabs going to turn a profit?</p>

<p>Although this title is not a huge leap from The Cosmic Shake, it is a clear step up from PHL Collective’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_patrick_star_game">The Patrick Star Game</a>. Where that title was more of a kiddy-friendly puzzler, this is an expansive collectathon platformer.</p>
<p>As a proud member of the multi-generational legion of SpongeBob fans, I always look forward to these. The presentation is flawless, Bikini Bottom and its inhabitants are lovingly rendered. Levels are full of NPCs, most of which have a quip to throw your way, and some have genuinely funny dialogue that’s worth discovering. It's fun to explore the levels (with the help of a handy surfboard), finding all the fish people tucked away in every corner.</p>
<p>Titans of the Tide lets you play as both SpongeBob and his dim starfish buddy. Through the magic of a BFF Ring, both characters are with you throughout the game. Each of them has a unique ability set that helps solve platforming and environmental puzzles across the levels.</p>

<p>You can swap between them with the push of a button, with the non-controlled character floating around as a ghost. This spectral companion acts as an objective guide and lights a path to the next goal within the generously sized environments.</p>
<p>Special abilities are fun to mix and match. SpongeBob utilise his karate experience, while Patrick can burrow underground and grapple with a spectral whip. Levels often encourage using this character-switching mechanic, and it is satisfying to swap between the two for traversal and combat.</p>
<p>Battling the spectral minions of the Flying Dutchman is a bit thin. You get simple melee combos and the occasional light environmental puzzle during boss encounters. Some enemies require the use of a newly discovered ability, although most encounters are little more than punch and move on.</p>

<p>Between quests, you'll head to the Floating Patty, a hub area where you can chat with NPCs and pick up side quests from the likes of Plankton and Sandy. There's a lot of content here, with a broad variety of locations and a ton of side content. Collecting everything doesn't have quite the same challenge as flagship 3D platformers, but what's here could easily fill a giant-sized Krabby Patty.</p>
<p>While not a graphical powerhouse, Titans of the Tide plays like a dream. Quality (30fps) and performance (60fps target) modes are both viable thanks to a motion smoothing slider. I always enjoy the stretchy animations and physics ripped straight out of the cartoon.</p>
<p>Audio is also great, with the cast of the show on hand to provide voice work; this alone will be worth the cost of admission for fans. It's worth noting that barely a second of gameplay goes by without a cheesy quip, dumb Patrick-ism, or signature laugh from Tom Kenny, so mileage may vary on your tolerance for that.</p>

<p>The only real gripe I have with Titans of the Tide is that it doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from the other two titles in Purple Lamp’s series revival. Aside from the ghostly enemies and ability switching mechanic, this game is no different from Battle for Bikini Bottom or Cosmic Shake. Even the in-game store, which contains a generous amount of skins for SpongeBob and Patrick, is basically the same as it was in the previous game. The format is reliable, but three games in and it's starting to creak.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of the other games in this cycle of platform adventures, you are going to love Titans of the Tide. It's another colourful, funny SpongeBob adventure from Purple Lamp and, just like the cartoon, repeat viewings don’t tend to lessen the magic. The formula is starting to show its age now, but it's still the best virtual Bikini Bottom we've got.</p></section>

<figure data-uuid="02b59d3d9989a"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b59d3d9989a/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Storage-hungry consumers in Japan have been jumping on available stocks of super-fast MicroSD cards as an ongoing memory shortage continues across the computer industry, with no signs of getting better in the immediate future.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>, a spiralling issue of rising costs and demand that's far exceeding availability means empty shelves and insane prices as regular consumers swoop on anything that's left over once large data centres and AI companies have bought up their fill. Oh, AI, is there anything you can't make worse?</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/spv/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a>, Tokyo-based vendor Techhouse Toei said that its inventory had been very badly affected. "The larger versions of popular series keep running out of stock...This might drag on for a while." With all sizes of MicroSD cards, from 256GB all the way up to 2TB models involved, it's not hard to see how or why consumers (and those pesky AI centres) might start to make the jump en masse to new and improved MicroSD Express technology used in Switch 2.</p>
<figure data-uuid="becc08a4273ea"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/becc08a4273ea/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Have you picked up one of these yet? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The report goes on to detail how even older tech, such as HDD drives with huge storage capacities, is being bought up. "It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use," one shop owner said, "so we aren't getting any stock at all. Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately… and the cycle repeats."</p>
<p>It's certainly something that's already been an issue here in the West, and even through our own personal searching for MicroSD Express cards online, it's been notably hard to find sizes beyond 256GB for anything approaching a reasonable price, and the 1TB options are already being sold for...well, a quick search indicates around £200, which is quite a lot.</p>
<p>Some of this, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/microsd-express-cards-are-selling-out-thanks-to-switch-2-fever">has been down to the popularity of Nintendo's console</a>, but there's little doubt that any further stress on MicroSD availability would make it significantly harder to find a card for your Switch 2.</p>
<p>With no signs of the supply situation abating, and with AI being the number one reason cited behind all of the shortages of storage, RAM, and GPUs, it does seem as though the prepared Switch 2 gamer should perhaps brace for the inevitable impact and nab some backup storage ASAP.</p>

<figure data-uuid="df1e6e9ca6684"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df1e6e9ca6684/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK physical gaming charts are in, giving us our first indication of how Nintendo's latest is performing on store shelves. You'll have to scroll a little way to find the new first-party release this week, mind you, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has missed out on a top 10 spot!</p>
<p>The game zoomed into 12th in its debut week, falling behind the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and — of course — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, all of which keep the Switch and Switch 2 in the upper bracket.</p>
<p>Of course, this might not be all that much of a surprise. Air Riders was always going to attract a niche audience with its blend of racing and all-out action, and with Mario Kart World still appearing new and shiny, we'd imagine that many people will be picking up just the one racer for their fresh console. We're sure the sales will be drastically different in Japan, which we'll find out later this week</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> parried its way back into the top 10 — thanks to all of those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-game-awards-nominees-announced-donkey-kong-bananza-up-for-goty">Game Awards nominations</a>, no doubt — and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-hades-2s-switch-2-physical-boasts-a-stunning-reversible-cover">sweet physical edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> made its debut at number 21. And if you're looking for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, you won't find it in <em>this</em> top 40...</p>
