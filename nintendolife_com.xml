<figure><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01ec2dfea7302/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>. You are now living in a post-Switch 2-release world. Having fun?</p>
<p>It's been a whirlwind month for Nintendo fans, with a brand new console to busy ourselves with! Consequently, penning missives to us at NL Towers hasn't been top of your list, it seems. Don't worry, we understand - those Peach Medallions aren't going to collect themselves!</p>
<p>So, it's time for a lighter edition of our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Let's sit back with a warm beverage and go through our dispatch box...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - June 2025</h2>

<h3>"gretsy" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone seemed really gretsy about the Switch 2 price point on announcement and then preorders sold out around the world in the first 30 seconds. I'm having trouble reading the temperature of the room and I'm wondering what you're seeing behind the scenes. Without revealing confidential metrics, can you talk about site engagement and user enthusiasm since the announcement? Where do you see this generation headed over the next several years? It looks like Nintendo is trading mass adoption for a flashy pop in the first year but what do I know? I'm just an email sitting in an in-box hoping someone finds me.</p>
<p>Keep calm and carry on! Your coverage is top tier!<br>
<strong>JJ Koester</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, JJ! Switch 2 has predictably seen a big bump in interest, although with games media struggling and sites going offline everywhere, it's hardly some massive secret that times are tough.</p>
<p>As for user enthusiasm, we've run a fair number of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/polls">polls</a> over the past couple of months, so they give a decent indication of general opinion. Pre-orders were always going to sell out, so I wouldn't put too much weight in that as an indicator of public sentiment. Anecdotally, I'll say that despite claiming she won't get one yet, my mum has already researched trade-in options and will 100% have a Switch 2 before the summer is out.</p>
<p>For me, it's a pricey device, yes, and $80 for Mario Kart is a kick. But it should come as zero surprise to anyone who's been paying any attention to the industry, and $450 isn't beyond what we were thinking before the price reveal - higher end, but not PS5-Pro-level <em>'What the hell?!'</em> The wider economic issues right now have definitely poured petrol on the price fire.</p>
<p>As for the future, it's now on Nintendo to dazzle us with games you can't play elsewhere that nobody else could or would make. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"disappointing"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey!<br>
I love this site. It’s my primary source for all things Nintendo.</p>
<p>I’m curious if you guys plan to review Monster Train 2 when it comes out in a few days. I’d love to hear your thoughts about it. I loved the first one, and I value your opinion.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This generation of games has produced some of the most disappointing sequels to some of favorite games:</p>
<p>- Sports Story<br>
- Mario + Rabbids 2<br>
- Switch Sports<br>
- Blossom Tales 2 (I liked the first, but not one of my favorites)<br>
- Tears of the Kingdom (you may have heard of it)</p>
<p>That could be a great article start. Most disappointing sequels to great games.<br>
<strong><em>KevinLo9</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weirdly, I've been discussing Monster Train 2 just recently (although note that Kevin's mail came in <em>just</em> too late to make last month's mailbag). Unfortunately, it's fallen through the coverage cracks with the Switch 2 hullabaloo.</p>
<p>With the first one being a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Game We Missed</a>, I was keen for us to cover the sequel, but the timing was, er, 'suboptimal'. Unfortunately, with things as they are, we have to be more selective than ever (far, far more than I'd like to be) when choosing which games to cover with a review, and Switch 2 soaked up all our resources.</p>
<p>Not sure I'm onboard with <em>all</em> those disappointing sequels, personally. But hey, different strokes. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I don’t lean"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was curious how you feel about WW being on switch 2. Do you think it was a smart decision to have the default GC version or would it better to just re-release the gorgeous Wii U remaster? I don’t lean one way or another, but I do suspect it was the Big N’s quickest means of attracting eyes towards the GC add-on which would the two games’ absence from S1. Just a theory, though.</p>
<p>Anyways, take care everyone!<br>
<strong><em>Yousef</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the upgrades, I personally just prefer the look of the original Wind Waker, and I don't think being on NSO precludes the Wii U version coming to Switch 2. The original game is still excellent (the repetitive wind-conducting aside), and having it readily available is fantastic. And yes, I'm sure it didn't hurt to be able to point to <em>another</em> Zelda game in the Switch collection.</p>
<p>Although for the cognoscenti among us, F-Zero GX alone would have been enough. Just F-Zero, nothing else in the GameCube app. Or on Switch 2. Ever. $450 for an F-Zero GX machine. Sold. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"jokesters"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of you jokesters thought it would be a good idea to change “Mother 3 (GBA)” in the search bar to “Mother 3 (GBA - Unknown)”. You had me thinking for a second that they announced it for a different platform. Whyyyyyyy<strong><br>
BandeeOfTheStars</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like the artmonkeys have been up to their tricks again. Certainly not a rogue acci-click from one of the team!...</p>
<p>All corrected now, thanks for the flag. And to prove that Bandee isn't just making things up to crowbar Mother 3 into the conversation, here's a pre-correction grab. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure><a title="Mother 3 Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f43ada0992fc7/mother-3-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<h3>"a slow drip"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that Nintendo will slowly release more enhancements to older first party software that wasn't part of the Switch 2 release updates? There's a handful of first party games that would benefit from the increased power from the Switch 2 that weren't included in the update list, and I wonder if Nintendo is planning a slow drip feed of improved games a la NSO releases.<strong><br>
Kazman2007</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine most of the first-party lineup will get an update of some sort, if only to address minor hiccups caused by the Switch 1 emulation. It's been great to see games getting 'silent' bumps across the board and in various cases fulfilling their potential - I might actually pick up the Arkham Trilogy now that Knight runs. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Feel free to respond to this letter however you wish as I'm not sure what I actually want to ask or say." - <strong>Willax</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Shmibblybops wartenshninkals! <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<p><em>That's all for this month! Thanks to everyone who wrote in, whether you were featured above or not.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3e3334b44c74/donkey-konga-2-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mmm, bananas. <em>Ahem</em>, sorry about that. We meant to say, welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we swing over to this week's bongo brawlers, let's quickly recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-jet-set-radio-dreamcast">last time</a> when three covers from the Dreamcast's <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> went head to head (to head). There was a decent spread of votes, but the funky Japanese design ultimately walked away with 46% of the split and the win. North America followed behind with 30%, and Europe took home the remaining slice — <em>funky</em>.</p>
<p>After the week we've had in Nintendo Land, there was only one direction we could head in this time. With DK on the brain, we're turning to the prized primate's beloved bongo-bashing sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> ('Hit Song Parade', in Japan), for another three-way vote.</p><p><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0nxvozm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You don't need us to provide a recap of this one. The series still slaps, it's been too long, trilogy remaster when? etc. Keep to the beat as we meet our three competitors below.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:159632,184111 @ 1750597651 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c0914233e26c/donkey-konga-2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Woah, DK! You're hitting the bongo so hard, your legs have swung into the air! That's too much bongo, DK!</p>
<p>The central pose is fitting, really, when you consider just how hard this cover slaps. The red and white background, the cel-shaded DK, that rock-and-roll spray-painted '2' in the logo. Just makes you want to whip out the peripherals and go for a bongo sesh, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b44c041163d/donkey-konga-2-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design is a little tamer, by comparison, but it does have added Diddy Kong, which is always a bonus. The bright green background subtly packs in some musical notes (a nice touch), and we're fans of the DK and Diddy sprites that appear in the logo — did we really need the other ones down the bottom, though?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78f5519329731/donkey-konga-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, now that's more like it! The logo from the European design returns here, but it takes centre stage on its own. With the focus on DK and Diddy, and the bonus balloons and confetti that are scattered around them, this one really sells the 'party' vibes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-donkey-konga-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "gnarly remake" adds multiple new parks</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> revives two more classics next month, but that's not all! In case you missed it, it's also adding a new pinball-themed park to the series featuring the Birdman himself.</p>
<p>This is one of multiple new parks "joining the lineup of original parks" in this upcoming title, due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>11th July 2025</strong>. To build up the excitement, Activision and Iron Galaxy have now released a new trailer showcasing this park in motion. Here's what you can expect along with some of the inspiration behind this design:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pinball drops players into a pinball game featuring the tombstones of fallen skaters around a playfield filled with ramps, rails, and flippers at the control of Tony Hawk. Watch out for silver balls running down the board and track your best combo on the backbox display.</p>
<p>"Developer Iron Galaxy Studios shares a special connection to pinball, many of its early members incorporating their knowledge acquired while working for Midway Games in Chicago, a prominent name in arcade and pinball gaming. This homage offers the perfect mix honoring their roots while flexing their creative skills in a wild new park design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can expect all sorts of wild segments throughout this park including "the eyeball", "brains", and even a river filled with "hungry alligators". Apart from this pinball park, some other new parks include Movie Studio and Waterpark.</p>
<p>Here are some additional screenshots and you can even get some "pro tips" about what to be on the lookout for in this park over on the official <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-park-map-guide-pinball">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 blog</a>.

<p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-sonic-racing-crossworlds-character-leaks-reportedly-surface">character leaks earlier this month</a>, Sega has now officially confirmed SpongeBob SquarePants and other Nickelodeon characters will be racing alongside Sonic and friends in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> when it arrives this September.</p>
<p>This news was shared during the 2025 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. SpongeBob (and Patrick Star) will be part of the game's season pass and will be joined by characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Avatar universe. This extends to themed vehicles and tracks.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<figure><a title="&quot;We'll Give You Full On-The-Cart Switch 2 Physical Releases&quot; Lost In Cult Tells Developers 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc797dec44da4/well-give-you-full-on-the-cart-switch-2-physical-releases-lost-in-cult-tells-developers-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Switch 2 Game-Key Cards</a> haven't gone down all that well with consumers.</p>
<p>While Japanese video game consultancy firm Kyos Inc insists that publishers are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">"thanking Nintendo"</a> for the move following rising production costs of physical media, others are less keen on them; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">almost 70% of you said you wouldn't be buying Game-Key Card releases</a>, and many companies within the industry have said they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nightdive-studios-ceo-says-that-game-key-cards-on-switch-2-is-disheartening">dislike the approach.</a></p>
<p>Game-Key Cards are Nintendo's attempt to bridge the gap between 'code in a box' releases and traditional game cards, where the game data is included on the card itself. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">Many have warned that this system is anti-consumer</a>; when Nintendo turns off the servers in a few years, the cards become useless.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">who has already spoken to us about the subject</a>, has taken to social media to issue a rallying call to developers—people don't want Game-Key Card releases, so, if your studio is looking to produce a physical Switch 2 release, they should get in touch with the boutique publisher:</p>

<p>While Game-Key Cards have been rejected by many consumers, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">recent leak</a> gives a pretty solid reason why so many companies are embracing them; if you want to publish your game physically on Switch 2, you have to pay Nintendo for 64GB card—there are no smaller options this time around, unfortunately, as was the case with Switch 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo itself has said it will not be using Game-Key Cards for any of its first-party games.</a></p>
