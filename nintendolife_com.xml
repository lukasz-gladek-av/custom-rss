<figure><a title="Digital Foundry Is &quot;Happy&quot; With Switch 2, But Feels The Screen Is &quot;Problematic&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20b1277270269/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The tech boffins over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their final verdict on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2</a>, and it's mostly positive—but the console's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">LCD screen</a> has been found wanting.</p>
<p>In his review, Digital Foundry boss and games media veteran Richard Leadbetter says that, overall, he's "happy" with Nintendo's new hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being significantly larger than Switch 1, the thinness of the handheld remains much the same, making it feel significantly less bulky than Steam Deck and other PC handhelds. Similarly, the bigger screen can make for a more immersive experience and colour reproduction is significantly improved over the original model. What’s also surprising – and highly appreciated – is the number of games that either run at native 1080p in handheld mode (like Mario Kart World, for example) or use DLSS to upscale to 1080p, delivering pleasing results.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter likes the hardware in general, taking time to praise the new Joy Con controllers and even citing the "little ‘feet’ on the bottom of the unit" as praise-worthy. "This is the original Switch revised and refined into a generally more pleasing and more effective unit, delivering a proper generational upgrade with highly impressive efficiency."</p>
<p>However, the console's LCD display—<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-according-to-new-analyst-rumour">a point of contention even before the console was released</a>—proved "problematic in a number of ways" for the industry vet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo promised HDR, but an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 nits will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range experience with the signature HDR contrast and highlights almost completely absent in handheld play. Even more disappointing is motion quality: the Switch 2 LCD has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">blurring characteristics</a> that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch’s display. Side by side with the Switch OLED panel, the key problems with Nintendo’s choice for Switch 2 come into sharp focus – it’s simply nowhere near as good.</p>
<p>There are clear problems with Switch 2’s VRR (variable refresh rate) functionality too. Now, in theory, we believe that there’s no reason why it should not work effectively. The Switch 2 Welcome Tour software includes a VRR showcase that demonstrates what we think is a 40-120Hz VRR window, but crucially it also reveals support for LFC – low frame-rate compensation – outside of that window. A fully featured VRR on Switch 2 is possible!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Another minor grumble relates to the length of the supplied USB-C cables, which Leadbetter feels simply aren't long enough.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow.1225209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="We love Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c9dcef21db1d/we-love-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the Back Page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I know what you're thinking. You just read that headline, and you said out loud to yourself: "Yes! I completely agree with this sentence. Never before have truer words been written onto the hallowed pages of the internet. All other journalists should pack up and quit, because this is the pinnacle of the craft; it simply does not get better from here."</p>
<p>I know. But I pitched 1,000 words, and so, that's what you'll get, even though you already agree with me. Woe! Such is my life.</p>
<p>So, here are a few examples of what every game on Switch could look like if they got smart, took a page out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s book, and realised that what the world needs is 'More Cow'.</p>
<h2>Super Smash Bros.</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f38ad7f2b6a/smash-bros-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The great thing about Cow in SSB is that no one wants to beat up Cow — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"I main Kirby."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've memorised every single Toon Link move."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can beat you with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back as any one of the indistinguishable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors">Fire Emblem</a> characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Who cares</em>? Most of the characters in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros</a>. have opposable thumbs, or, at the very least, little hand-nubs like Jigglypuff and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> Villager. Fighting is pretty much a fist-based sport. You're all playing with the training wheels on.</p>
<p>And do you know what that means? Only <em>true</em> SSB aficionados would choose Cow – a character with no fists. Or arms. Cow doesn't even have an angry game-face, just a placid, terrifying smile, ready to strike fear into the hearts of every opponent like Pikachu wishes he could.</p>
<p>Bonus: you can refer to Cow as having a "moo-veset".</p>
<h3>Metroid</h3>
<figure><a title="Metroid with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43bdd945205a8/metroid-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mootroid Moosion. Samoos Aran. Et cetera — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so, you know the Metroids? The iconic jellyfish-like aliens from the series, which Samus has to kill and/or learn to love? Very scary and/or cute, right?</p>
<p>Sure, sure. But hear me out: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> is one of the most frequently played speedruns at the various Games Done Quick tournaments, and do you know what part gets the audience most excited? It's a little detour called <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/125534/what-is-super-metroids-save-or-kill-the-animals-incentive-sgdq-2021">Save the Animals</a>, where the speedrunner has to take precious seconds out of their time returning to an early room to free a bunch of space-birds and space-monkeys before the planet explodes, extinguishing all extant life.</p>
<p>So, we know people who play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> love animals. Why not give them what they really want – SPACE-COWS? Samus could ride them through the levels instead of having to Morph-Ball everywhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/seriously-what-the-heck-is-going-on-inside-samusr-morph-ball">which can't be good for her spine</a>.</p>
<h3>Splatoon</h3>
<figure><a title="Splatoon with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c4cf19b41a7d8/splatoon-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look! The three flavours of milk! This game designs itself, really — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I commend Nintendo for discovering the fun combination of squids and ink, but let's be real: it could be any animal and the fluid it produces. Bees and honey. Horses and sweat. Hippos and blood. Why not cows and milk?</p>
<p>Imagine this: you're playing a game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> (Spilt Milk Edition), and you've dressed up your cow in cool sunglasses and legwarmers. You load up your milk gun, which is directly attached to your character's udders, and let rip, spraying fresh 3.5% all over the floor like you think the dirt is cereal. You take out one of the enemy team (whose milk is a chocolatey brown) in a slippy, creamy massacre, before diving into the white stuff and swimming through curds to get to their base and cover it in dairy graffiti.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound fun, and not at all horrendous?</p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<figure><a title="Breath of the Wild with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6dab908154b85/breath-of-the-wild-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I put an extra Cow in this image so they can be friends — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know cows already exist in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">LoZ</a> world, but they're usually cooped up on Lon Lon Ranch, stuck in underground caves, or getting abducted by aliens, and they always look <em>so sad</em>. Let's give Hyrule's cows the recognition they deserve by promoting them to Series Regular. I've already got someone in mind to demote: Epona.</p>
<p>Put away the pitchforks! Epona can still stick around, just in a lesser role. It's not like Link's never replaced her before – remember that motorbike in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_-_the_champions_ballad_plus_expansion_pass">Breath of the Wild</a>? That's not a <em>whole</em> lot different to a cow, really.</p>
<p>Besides, Epona doesn't give you delicious, HP-restoring milk. That's a point in Cow's favour.</p>
<h3>Star Fox</h3>
<figure><a title="Star Fox with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ed91ece7126e9/star-fox-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>MOO a barrel roll <i title=":smiley:"></i> — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Slippy's a frog. Peppy's a bunny. Falco's a bird. Sure, I can suspend my disbelief enough to believe that woodland creatures can A) exist in space, B) fly spacecraft, and C) toss witty banter at one another long enough to become friends, but do you know what I <em>don't</em> believe? That there are no cows in space.</p>
<p>You're telling me that an animal LITERALLY KNOWN FOR BEING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS doesn't exist in space? And that it wouldn't have encyclopaedic knowledge of spaceships, having been on so many? I don't buy it! Aliens, much like me, love cows, and there's a good reason for that: they make great astronauts.</p>
<p>Give Slippy, Peppy, Falco and co. a cow friend, call it Milktopher Cow or whatever, and give the people what they want.</p>
<h3>Balatro</h3>
<figure><a title="Balatro with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7504f122ebc3/balatro-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wouldn't Balatro make you 50% less grumpy if all the cards were cows? Yes. — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, why not! LocalThunk has done so many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> collabs already – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>, and more – why not a cow deck?</p>
<p>There's already a cow-adjacent Joker ("The Bull"), so I feel like LocalThunk might be amenable to more cow cards.</p>
<p>Was this an excuse to draw my own cow cards? Yes. Yes it was.</p>
<h3>Nintencows</h3>
<figure><a title="Nintendogs with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dfd1eedc59ac3/nintendogs-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Genius — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>. But with cows.</p>
<hr>
<p>You herd it here first, folks: these are just some of the games that would be better with nature's most beautiful and beefiest ungulates. Do you have suggestions for how to <em>steer</em> the industry in the bovine direction? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01ec2dfea7302/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>. You are now living in a post-Switch 2-release world. Having fun?</p>
<p>It's been a whirlwind month for Nintendo fans, with a brand new console to busy ourselves with! Consequently, penning missives to us at NL Towers hasn't been top of your list, it seems. Don't worry, we understand - those Peach Medallions aren't going to collect themselves!</p>
<p>So, it's time for a lighter edition of our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Let's sit back with a warm beverage and go through our dispatch box...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - June 2025</h2>

<h3>"gretsy" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone seemed really gretsy about the Switch 2 price point on announcement and then preorders sold out around the world in the first 30 seconds. I'm having trouble reading the temperature of the room and I'm wondering what you're seeing behind the scenes. Without revealing confidential metrics, can you talk about site engagement and user enthusiasm since the announcement? Where do you see this generation headed over the next several years? It looks like Nintendo is trading mass adoption for a flashy pop in the first year but what do I know? I'm just an email sitting in an in-box hoping someone finds me.</p>
<p>Keep calm and carry on! Your coverage is top tier!<br>
<strong>JJ Koester</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, JJ! Switch 2 has predictably seen a big bump in interest, although with games media struggling and sites going offline everywhere, it's hardly some massive secret that times are tough.</p>
<p>As for user enthusiasm, we've run a fair number of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/polls">polls</a> over the past couple of months, so they give a decent indication of general opinion. Pre-orders were always going to sell out, so I wouldn't put too much weight in that as an indicator of public sentiment. Anecdotally, I'll say that despite claiming she won't get one yet, my mum has already researched trade-in options and will 100% have a Switch 2 before the summer is out.</p>
<p>For me, it's a pricey device, yes, and $80 for Mario Kart is a kick. But it should come as zero surprise to anyone who's been paying any attention to the industry, and $450 isn't beyond what we were thinking before the price reveal - higher end, but not PS5-Pro-level <em>'What the hell?!'</em> The wider economic issues right now have definitely poured petrol on the price fire.</p>
<p>As for the future, it's now on Nintendo to dazzle us with games you can't play elsewhere that nobody else could or would make. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"disappointing"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey!<br>
I love this site. It’s my primary source for all things Nintendo.</p>
<p>I’m curious if you guys plan to review Monster Train 2 when it comes out in a few days. I’d love to hear your thoughts about it. I loved the first one, and I value your opinion.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This generation of games has produced some of the most disappointing sequels to some of favorite games:</p>
<p>- Sports Story<br>
- Mario + Rabbids 2<br>
- Switch Sports<br>
- Blossom Tales 2 (I liked the first, but not one of my favorites)<br>
- Tears of the Kingdom (you may have heard of it)</p>
<p>That could be a great article start. Most disappointing sequels to great games.<br>
<strong><em>KevinLo9</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weirdly, I've been discussing Monster Train 2 just recently (although note that Kevin's mail came in <em>just</em> too late to make last month's mailbag). Unfortunately, it's fallen through the coverage cracks with the Switch 2 hullabaloo.</p>
<p>With the first one being a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Game We Missed</a>, I was keen for us to cover the sequel, but the timing was, er, 'suboptimal'. Unfortunately, with things as they are, we have to be more selective than ever (far, far more than I'd like to be) when choosing which games to cover with a review, and Switch 2 soaked up all our resources.</p>
<p>Not sure I'm onboard with <em>all</em> those disappointing sequels, personally. But hey, different strokes. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I don’t lean"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was curious how you feel about WW being on switch 2. Do you think it was a smart decision to have the default GC version or would it better to just re-release the gorgeous Wii U remaster? I don’t lean one way or another, but I do suspect it was the Big N’s quickest means of attracting eyes towards the GC add-on which would the two games’ absence from S1. Just a theory, though.</p>
<p>Anyways, take care everyone!<br>
<strong><em>Yousef</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the upgrades, I personally just prefer the look of the original Wind Waker, and I don't think being on NSO precludes the Wii U version coming to Switch 2. The original game is still excellent (the repetitive wind-conducting aside), and having it readily available is fantastic. And yes, I'm sure it didn't hurt to be able to point to <em>another</em> Zelda game in the Switch collection.</p>
<p>Although for the cognoscenti among us, F-Zero GX alone would have been enough. Just F-Zero, nothing else in the GameCube app. Or on Switch 2. Ever. $450 for an F-Zero GX machine. Sold. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"jokesters"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of you jokesters thought it would be a good idea to change “Mother 3 (GBA)” in the search bar to “Mother 3 (GBA - Unknown)”. You had me thinking for a second that they announced it for a different platform. Whyyyyyyy<strong><br>
BandeeOfTheStars</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like the artmonkeys have been up to their tricks again. Certainly not a rogue acci-click from one of the team!...</p>
<p>All corrected now, thanks for the flag. And to prove that Bandee isn't just making things up to crowbar Mother 3 into the conversation, here's a pre-correction grab. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure><a title="Mother 3 Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f43ada0992fc7/mother-3-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<h3>"a slow drip"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that Nintendo will slowly release more enhancements to older first party software that wasn't part of the Switch 2 release updates? There's a handful of first party games that would benefit from the increased power from the Switch 2 that weren't included in the update list, and I wonder if Nintendo is planning a slow drip feed of improved games a la NSO releases.<strong><br>
Kazman2007</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine most of the first-party lineup will get an update of some sort, if only to address minor hiccups caused by the Switch 1 emulation. It's been great to see games getting 'silent' bumps across the board and in various cases fulfilling their potential - I might actually pick up the Arkham Trilogy now that Knight runs. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>

We meant to say, welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we swing over to this week's bongo brawlers, let's quickly recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-jet-set-radio-dreamcast">last time</a> when three covers from the Dreamcast's <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> went head to head (to head). There was a decent spread of votes, but the funky Japanese design ultimately walked away with 46% of the split and the win. North America followed behind with 30%, and Europe took home the remaining slice — <em>funky</em>.</p>
<p>After the week we've had in Nintendo Land, there was only one direction we could head in this time. With DK on the brain, we're turning to the prized primate's beloved bongo-bashing sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> ('Hit Song Parade', in Japan), for another three-way vote.</p><p><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0klhgyo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You don't need us to provide a recap of this one. The series still slaps, it's been too long, trilogy remaster when? etc. Keep to the beat as we meet our three competitors below.</p>

<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c0914233e26c/donkey-konga-2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Woah, DK! You're hitting the bongo so hard, your legs have swung into the air! That's too much bongo, DK!</p>
<p>The central pose is fitting, really, when you consider just how hard this cover slaps. The red and white background, the cel-shaded DK, that rock-and-roll spray-painted '2' in the logo. Just makes you want to whip out the peripherals and go for a bongo sesh, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b44c041163d/donkey-konga-2-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design is a little tamer, by comparison, but it does have added Diddy Kong, which is always a bonus. The bright green background subtly packs in some musical notes (a nice touch), and we're fans of the DK and Diddy sprites that appear in the logo — did we really need the other ones down the bottom, though?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78f5519329731/donkey-konga-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, now that's more like it! The logo from the European design returns here, but it takes centre stage on its own. With the focus on DK and Diddy, and the bonus balloons and confetti that are scattered around them, this one really sells the 'party' vibes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-donkey-konga-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "gnarly remake" adds multiple new parks</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> revives two more classics next month, but that's not all! In case you missed it, it's also adding a new pinball-themed park to the series featuring the Birdman himself.</p>
<p>This is one of multiple new parks "joining the lineup of original parks" in this upcoming title, due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>11th July 2025</strong>. To build up the excitement, Activision and Iron Galaxy have now released a new trailer showcasing this park in motion. Here's what you can expect along with some of the inspiration behind this design:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pinball drops players into a pinball game featuring the tombstones of fallen skaters around a playfield filled with ramps, rails, and flippers at the control of Tony Hawk. Watch out for silver balls running down the board and track your best combo on the backbox display.</p>
<p>"Developer Iron Galaxy Studios shares a special connection to pinball, many of its early members incorporating their knowledge acquired while working for Midway Games in Chicago, a prominent name in arcade and pinball gaming. This homage offers the perfect mix honoring their roots while flexing their creative skills in a wild new park design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can expect all sorts of wild segments throughout this park including "the eyeball", "brains", and even a river filled with "hungry alligators". Apart from this pinball park, some other new parks include Movie Studio and Waterpark.</p>
<p>Here are some additional screenshots and you can even get some "pro tips" about what to be on the lookout for in this park over on the official <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-park-map-guide-pinball">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 blog</a>.
