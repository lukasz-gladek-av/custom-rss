<figure><a title="Switch 2 Camera 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f0089c56124/switch-2-camera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the lead-up to the Switch 2 launch, one of the biggest talking points from Nintendo was the new GameChat feature and accompanying camera. Heck, the company even reunited with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/paul-rudd-returns-in-an-awesome-snes-style-switch-2-commercial">actor and SNES legend Paul Rudd</a> for a new commercial showcasing the technology: <em>“Now you’re playing together,”</em> as if the previous four decades of multiplayer functionality on Nintendo consoles meant absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>With the confirmation that pretty much any USB-C camera will work with the Switch 2, just how does the official camera actually hold up, though?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, overall. It’s a pretty slick piece of hardware that blends in really well with both the Switch 2 itself and whatever TV setup you happen to be rocking at home (oh, and you can also plug it into a laptop and use it as a webcam, if you like). But despite its 1080p resolution, the actual image quality can look a little muddy, particularly if you have to zoom in. Considering its <strong>£49.99 / $54.99</strong> price tag, this is definitely a tad disappointing.</p>

<p>Looking at the camera itself, it’s a surprisingly dinky little thing. I don’t know why I thought it was much bigger prior to launch, but getting my hands on it for the first time revealed that it sits at just 17cm in height. That’s pretty small! In practice, it’s probably just a tad shorter than the length of my hand from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger. So definitely nice and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The base and stand feel as though they’re made from metal, pretty solid and slightly cool to the touch. Meanwhile, the base is cushioned to prevent any scratches on the device or whatever surface you happen to place it on. The camera at the top is housed in a circular casing which feels slightly hollow — brittle, even, like one drop on a hard surface could crack it — but the light weight makes it easy to adjust the viewing angle.</p>

<p>As standard, the camera comes with a USB-C cable which you can use to plug it into the top of console via its secondary USB-C slot, while the other end slots into the camera around its backside. About three-quarters of the way down the camera’s stand is a small clip to tidy the cable away slightly. Finally, a thin dial is situated around the lens: turning this anti-clockwise shields the lens with a small, built-in white cover, definitely handy for when you’re not using the camera but can't be bothered to unplug it.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a pretty well-made piece of kit; solid, sleek, functional, and inconspicuous enough to simply blend into the background. Where things get a <em>little</em> messy is when you actually start using it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, setup is an absolute breeze. Once you’ve got it plugged into the Switch 2 (and you can use it in docked or handheld mode), you simply create or join a GameChat session, navigate to the quick settings on-screen, and select the camera icon to turn it on. By default, it’ll show your surroundings, but you can activate a filter to remove this.</p>

<p>The main issue is resolution. I imagine that most, like myself, will have the camera set up next to a TV while docked. In an average family environment, chances are you’re going to be sitting a couple of meters away on a comfy couch. This means that the default image is quite far away, and so you’ll appear pretty small on-screen. Great for showing groups of people during gameplay, sure, (and the camera can pick out four faces), but not if you're on your own.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is you can zoom in via settings to the point where your head takes up most of the image space, but in doing so, the image gets extremely fuzzy.</p>
<p>Of course, the other option is to place the camera a bit nearer, if you’re able. In a lot of living room settings, this might not be entirely feasible, but if you’re playing in a small office environment on a desk or something, then you can probably get pretty close and alleviate those resolution issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the zoom functionality, you can also apply the aforementioned background filter to the image (a system-wide thing and not limited to the official camera). It’s nothing too extravagant, but the two options effectively remove your immediate surroundings. One keeps the overall composition intact, but makes it so that only you display in the image. This is reasonably well done, but be prepared to see a bit of jank around your head and body.</p>

<p>The other display option crops the image down to just your head within a small circle, again applying the same filter to remove anything in the background. The jank from the previous filter still crops up here, and it can be a little irritating in isolation, but when you’re knee-deep in a Knockout Rally on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, chances are you won’t notice it.</p>
<p>What's odd, however, is that Mario Kart World specifically recommends this filter, and I can't quite nail down why. I imagine it's to really hone in on the 'fun, whimsical' nature of the game, but the default setting with no filters applied looks undeniably cleaner.</p>
<p>The only other thing worth noting is that there’s no way to mount the camera on the Switch 2 itself when playing in handheld mode. This is an advantage currently enjoyed by Hori's Piranha Plant Camera, which you can plug into the USB-C slot at the top and carry about with you; I imagine that would definitely come in handy for those quick handheld sessions on the go.</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo's camera does boast a higher resolution, so which you ultimately opt for will depend on what you value more: slightly higher image quality or more flexibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the elegant, sleek design of the official Switch 2 camera, we would have expected the same kind of 'wow' factor to be present in the actual image quality on display. Alas, despite the 1080p resolution, any scenario in which you need to zoom in at all makes the image incredibly fuzzy.</p>
<p>That said, in practice, the novelty of seeing your friends' faces after you've chucked a Blue Shell at them in Mario Kart World is a genuine blast and, in that context, concerns about image quality generally fade away. We've no doubt that third parties will come out with more accomplished, feature-rich cameras in the future, but for now, Nintendo's official offering is a solid, albeit nonessential option.</p>

<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156750/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> feels like the culmination of everything Hazelight Studios has accomplished in the co-op space.</p>
<p>The journey began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brothers_a_tale_of_two_sons">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a>, a charming fantasy that required solo players to coordinate both thumbs to control two characters simultaneously. The studio then progressed to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/a_way_out">A Way Out</a>, a jailbreak caper that introduced several clever mechanics for two players, including the now-standard Friend's Pass system (more on that later). With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Hazelight pushed things even further, delivering a big adventure with a well-written, emotionally resonant story and great characters.</p>
<p>Now comes Split Fiction, a near-flawless dual odyssey that perfects the studio's formula and delivers an epic experience of staggering variety. The game’s many co-op trials might put your strongest relationships to the test, but you will never stop having fun.</p>

<p>The story is, fittingly, about stories. Mio and Zoe are two aspiring writers lured to the shady tech giant Rader Publishing by the promise of a no-strings book deal. Upon arrival, they’re suited up in <strong>Tron</strong>-like bodysuits and instructed to enter a set of strange, floating bubbles. Mio hesitates and, after a brief struggle, ends up inside Zoe’s bubble. They awaken inside the physical manifestation of their combined imagination. The two unlikely companions must survive their own ideas, while trying to stop Rader from stealing their IP.</p>
<p>The adventure unfolds across two vastly different mindscapes, built from the main characters' chosen theme. Mio’s choice of fiction is cyberpunk-style sci-fi, while Zoe prefers cosy fantasy. These contrasting settings give Hazelight the perfect excuse to drop partners into dramatically different environments that demand teamwork, creative problem solving, and synchronised playstyles.</p>
<p>At its heart, Split Fiction thrives on this collision of two distinct genres, using the stylistic clash as a narrative engine to drive inventive cooperative gameplay. The plot is built to sustain momentum; Mio and Zoe are constantly plunged into tense, in-media-res scenarios that keep the action moving and the players engaged.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction at Rader Corp, our deuteragonists are thrown straight into chaos, first piloting a spaceship in a frantic battle, then fleeing from a horde of giant ogres. Soon after, they’re swinging across the rooftop of a futuristic nightclub and bouncing around as a pair of pigs in a (surprisingly dark) fairytale scenario. This all happens in the opening chapter.</p>
<p>Each world is packed with elaborate set pieces, and the action rarely lets up. Mio and Zoe leap from one high-energy scenario to the next, pausing only occasionally for charming, character-driven moments that deepen their bond. Slowly bringing these two contrasting archetypes together in the middle of all this action is a storytelling masterstroke, one that pays off in the game's phenomenal final act.</p>
<p>So, what do you actually do in Split Fiction? What genre is it? The answer, quite simply, is all of them. It’s a puzzle game, a shooter, a brawler, and a platformer, sometimes all within the same level. Across its lengthy main story, there’s a little bit of everything. This grab-bag format means that you have a consistent grasp on what you will have to do next.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155173/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The only drawback is that, by its very nature, the game doesn't linger on any one activity for long. That’s unfortunate, because many of its ideas are strong enough to support a full game on their own.</p>
<p>Each chapter grants the aspiring writers a unique ability, and most of the level’s progression is built around using that power in creative ways. Often, both players are required to perform different tasks simultaneously, making strong communication and patience essential. These challenges never feel overwhelming, and the game’s generous checkpoint system ensures that frustration is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>There are still moments that will really test the patience of you and your partner. Faster-paced sequences, like high-speed chases or boss fights, are often hilarious exercises in trial and error.</p>

<p>What makes Split Fiction exceptional is the sheer variety of challenges you face. There are hundreds of mechanically distinct minigames spread across this adventure and every single one feels thoughtfully crafted. Alongside the linear main story, optional side quests offer wild artistic swings and some of the most difficult activities in the game.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of this solid Switch 2 port is that it's a nice showcase of the console's capabilities, with the exception of mouse control, which is unfortunately missing.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks great. This is a gorgeous game, with a vibrant art style and busy environments that often move at breakneck speeds. Performance remains stable throughout, with a locked 30fps that has only the slightest of stumbles in handheld mode for some of the bigger set pieces. It would be nice to have 60fps, but it runs incredibly well with the lower frame rate.</p>
<p>The big feature here is the Friend's Pass system. Like previous Hazelight titles, two separate consoles can share a single copy of the game. This time, too, you can use Switch 2 and Nintendo’s GameShare feature to host a session that an original Switch can join. This not only offers incredible value but also ensures that co-op partners who don’t own the new console aren’t left out. As it's running from the host console and not an installed version of the game, the performance on the OG Switch can be a tad unpredictable, but it's mostly steady.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156761/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside GameShare — and the option to play local splitscreen and online — there’s also crossplay, so there’s a generous number of ways to play with others.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is a singular experience, one that you'll want to jump right back into after the credits roll. It's the crowning achievement of Hazelight, a studio whose every release is becoming a notable event. It's also a great time on Switch 2 and ranks among the very best of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">the launch lineup</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Split Fiction feels like a gift. Its sole aim is to entertain and bring players together by testing them at every turn. Hazelight gives us two distinct worlds, each filled with a huge array of activities for co-op partners to enjoy and argue over. It serves as a surprising visual showcase for the Switch 2 and enhances the Friend's Pass feature, allowing our original Switch buddies to join in the fun.</p></section>
