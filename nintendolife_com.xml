<p>Firm cites Switch 2 release of Shadows as a contributing factor</p>

<p>In fact, the firm states that the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise has "overperformed" this quarter, noting that year-on-year growth in active users is in "double-digits". The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the Switch 2 has been cited as a contributing factor, which Ubisoft says enabled the title to "broaden its audience". It also mentions the <strong>Valley of Memory</strong> update for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, which launched in November 2025.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0ejuhzmq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ubisoft is pushing ahead with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">big company restructure</a>. It's currently consulting with employees at its Paris headquarters with a view to reduce its headcount by 200. Meanwhile, it's aiming to finalise its new operating model in April. This will consist of five 'creative houses', with the flagship – Vantage Studios – already operational since October 2025. This creative house will focus on Assassin's Creed, <strong>Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
<p>"In parallel, we are making progress on the transformation announced in January. The allocation of studios and capabilities across the Creative Houses and Network has now been announced, and key leadership appointments are ongoing, including external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans. This transformation is designed to sharpen focus, accelerate decision-making and elevate our creative ambition in an increasingly selective market. Vantage Studios has been operational since October and we are preparing for the rest of this new operating model to start running in early April."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time will tell, but it seems like Ubisoft will be keen to continue supporting the Switch 2 going forwards. Indeed, it's looking more and more likely that a remaster/remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag</a> will launch in the near future. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-pops-up-on-amazon">An art book</a> for the release was spotted on Amazon UK, giving us yet another clear indication of the game's existence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> has swept the top three spots across Switch 1, Switch 2, and PS5. The game sold 177,563 copies on Switch 1, 160,101 copies on Switch 2, and 118,798 on PS5, making up over 450,000 physical game sales this week. Most impressively, those Switch 1 and Switch 2 sales are pretty close. Looking back, those numbers are a little better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a>, which managed just over 410,000 sales in its first week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="xVamke1SJCY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytxVamke1SJCY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8a8013tkspwo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Back to the recent charts, fourth place goes to another new release, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/nioh_3">Nioh 3</a>, the action RPG sequel which has been a critical hit with reviewers. But it isn't close to Dragon Quest at all, shifting 40,570 units on PS5.</p>
<p>It's another big drop to reach the rest of the charts, then, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and a few other Switch 1 and 2 regulars making up the list.</p>

<p>In contrast to software sales, hardware tells a very similar story to last week, as numbers continue to slip <em>very</em> slightly. The Switch 2 was again the only single console to sell over 10,000 units this week, shifting another 65,807 units.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 skus sold a combined 8,892 units, with the majority of those sales coming from the Switch Lite. In comparison, the PS5's three skus sold 11,130. It seems like more and more players are migrating over to the Switch 2 in Japan.</p>
<p>So, another quiet week for the console market — let's have a look at the full hardware charts:</p>

<p>At least, according to Kadokawa's latest financial report</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="38beb9716a6bd"><a title="The Duskbloods" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38beb9716a6bd/the-duskbloods.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p>If everything goes to plan, FromSoftware is poised to have a big 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> were announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct in April 2025, but things have been pretty quiet for both games since.</p>
<p>However, both titles have been mentioned in Kadokawa's (FromSoftware's owner) <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">Earnings Report for Q3 2025/26</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-owner-reiterates-duskbloods-is-still-coming-this-year-exclusive-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), and both are still aiming for a 2026 release window. Unfortunately, responses in the report are pretty vague, but at least both games are still alive, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytDE5HpSoUj-c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbmqtokg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>When asked about a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Kadokawa merely states that "we have yet to announce a specific release date", but the question does wonder whether the game is included in the fiscal year's outlook, which Kadokawa "[has] not disclosed". So maybe don't expect it in the next month.</p>
<p>It's a similar story for The Duskbloods, where Kadokawa again says it hasn't announced "a specific release date". The report does confirm that it'll be sold on a joint basis with Nintendo "with sales responsibilities divided by region" and reiterates that the game will be a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>

<p>So, that's all we're getting for now, it seems. We'll likely just have to wait until the next big Nintendo Direct to hear <em>something</em>. And even then, it isn't a guarantee.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was actually meant to come out in 2025; as a port of the critically-acclaimed open world RPG, it'll include a few brand new jobs and includes the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Early hands-on reports at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">were pretty negative</a> regarding the state of the port, but fans and critics have come away <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/heres-another-look-at-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2">a bit happier with later builds</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've heard or seen next to nothing of The Duskbloods since its reveal, besides a brief little clip at The Game Awards last year and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-duskbloods-could-be-fromsoftwares-most-ambitious-game-yet-according-to-leak">a little leaker tidbit</a> which claims the game contains "many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of". We know it's a PvPvE game where you pick a vampire-like character and customise them in order to go out and fight others online, and... that's about it.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're looking forward to seeing more of them this year, hopefully.</p>
