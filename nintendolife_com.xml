<p>Ahead of EVO 2025 later this week, Arc System Works has finally shared an update about the Switch version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, which was released at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Following a previous update, the development team has now confirmed the DLC characters Venom, Unika and Lucy will be made available for the Switch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. This version of the game is also expected to bring the Nintendo version "up to speed with the latest version".</p>
<p>This includes balance adjustments, ranked matches, and also plans to address some text issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Guilty Gear Strive Nintendo Switch Edition Update (Fall 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the long wait regarding the update for Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Venom and Unika, along with Lucy, are planned for an update in the Fall of 2025.<br>
Development for the Nintendo Switch Edition involves porting the character after completion, followed by sequential optimization and processing load reduction.</p>
<p>The Fall 2025 update is expected to bring it up to speed with the latest version, including not only playable character additions but also Digital Figures, balance adjustments, and Ranked Matches. Additionally, we are addressing issues where text is difficult to read in some language settings. Please look forward to the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows multiple DLC character updates for other platforms. The Switch version of the game includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>

<p>Unlock a new theme next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>DK is back in his latest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and apart from new merch and promotions in mobile games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, he's also getting his very own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event.</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo's Switch Online-focused battle-royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a> game will be hosting a special event between <strong>1st - 4th August, 2025</strong>. In this limited-time Maximus Cup, you'll be able to unlock a theme including special art, music and Tetrimino designs once you've accumulated 100 event points.</p>
<p>This event marks the 48th Maximus Cup event. If you haven't played Donkey Kong Bananza yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest update for Tetris 99 follows a Maximus Cup in June, which saw the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/tetris-99s-new-maximus-cup-sees-the-return-of-four-nintendo-themes">four Nintendo themes</a>.</p>

<p>Mario Paint is finally back!!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've been waiting to see the Super Nintendo title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> make a return, we've kind of got some exciting news today.</p>
<p>The game has officially been added to the SNES app for Switch Online users. The catch is, it requires a mouse. On Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls to play the game, and for original Switch users, you can simply plug in a compatible USB mouse.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description for Mario Paint and you can see the game in action in the video above. Japan has received the <a href="https://youtu.be/uBn3orcH6O0">same update this week</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1992 Super NES game turns your system into a canvas, with an array of colors and drawing tools available to create digital works of art. You can even animate your drawings and compose music to craft your own video creations! Get ready to unlock your inner artist using the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality on Nintendo Switch 2, or by using a compatible USB mouse (sold separately) on a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch – OLED Model system.</p>
<p>And just like in the original game, you can access the Coloring Book featuring fun designs and character art or play the Gnat Attack training game for some extra mouse control fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this release, Nintendo has also added the Mario Paint soundtrack to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today. All up, it features 19 tracks with a total runtime of 28 minutes.</p>
<p>To access Mario Paint on the Switch 2 or Switch, you'll need to have an active Switch Online membership. This will also allow you to listen to the game's album on Nintendo's Music app.</p>
<p>And to top it off, this update for the SNES app has <a href="https://youtu.be/BFpqxvRw9qI">also added mouse support</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-paint-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-online-release-features-mouse-controls/">via Nintendo Everything</a>). Today's update to the 'Nintendo Classics' library <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/rumour-nintendo-may-be-looking-to-add-snes-mouse-support-to-switch-online">follows a rumour last year</a> about Switch Online getting mouse compatibility.</p>
<p>Today's digital SNES library update has taken place alongside the latest Switch 2 and Switch firmware update, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the systems up to Version 20.3.0</a>.</p>

<p>A new trailer has also dropped</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<p><strong>Update #3 [<time datetime="2025-07-29T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 29th Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a>'s developer Siactro confirmed this latest entry would arrive on <strong>8th August 2025</strong> for <strong>$4.99</strong>. To go with this announcement, we've got another trailer.</p>
<p>Although the game is releasing on the original Switch, it will also be playable and purchasable on the Switch 2.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #2 [<time datetime="2024-12-08T07:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 8th Dec 2024, 7am</time>]:</strong></p><p>Following the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> last month, developer Siactro has now released a brand new gameplay trailer featuring the music track Blackbird Down (Toree Saturn OST) by KB. This game will arrive on Switch and PC in "early 2025".</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #1 [<time datetime="2024-11-24T13:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 24th Nov 2024, 1:35pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> was scheduled to arrive this year on the Switch, developer Siactro has announced the game has now been delayed until early 2025. The quality would have apparently "suffered a lot" had it been released next month. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am sorry, but I have to delay Toree Saturn into early 2025. A december release was possible, but the quality would have suffered a lot. I worked with really incredible people on this and I am not going to treat their work with a low quality release. I am very sorry!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>When we get a release date update, we'll be sure to let you know!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer and PC demo for the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a></strong> have been released, with the developer Siactro also reconfirming the new entry will arrive at some point in <strong>2024</strong>. This latest update mentions a Nintendo Switch release, too.</p>
<p>When this new project was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/toree-saturn-looks-set-to-provide-even-more-adorable-low-poly-platforming-next-year">originally announced in September last year</a>, there was no Nintendo announcement at that point, so there you go!</p>

<p>Here's a brief rundown about what to expect from the latest entry in this speed-based 3D platformer series (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549240/Toree_Saturn/">via Steam</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way."</p>
<p>- Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​</p>
<p>- New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​</p>
<p>- Controlling Toree got way easier!​<br>
No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​<br>
Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​<br>
Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&amp;M)</p>
