<p>In case you missed it, the recently released game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> teased the second chapter.</p>
<p>Now, in an update via Falcom's <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/ir-data/20251112-1">latest financial report for September 2025</a>, the company has reportedly locked in a release window for the remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC – with the game scheduled to arrive by the fiscal year ending <strong>September 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-doesnt-get-a-sequel-our-fans-will-go-youve-got-to-be-kidding-me-nihon-falcom-ceo-on-future-releases/">recent interview</a>, the Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo mentioned how a remake of the second entry had to happen. Once again, here's what he had to say (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">via Push Square</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067srmzuh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If we didn’t follow up with a remake of Trails in the Sky SC, people would go, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ So, we do want to do a remake along the lines of Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/highly-anticipated-rpg-remake-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-confirmed-for-2026-release">colleagues at Push Square also note</a>, "the second Trails in the Sky game is widely considered to be one of the franchise's best instalments. It's got a gut-punching story and some fantastic character development — alongside some of the most memorable boss encounters in the series".</p>
<p>And without getting too far ahead, Kondo has previously stated how anything beyond this (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">as in a remake of the third instalment</a>) will likely come down to "fan demand". For now, no specific platforms have been confirmed for the second chapter just yet, so when there's an official announcement, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>The 1st Chapter was released on the Switch and Switch 2 on 19th September 2025, and since then, the Switch 2 version has received some "image quality and performance settings". There's also a demo you can download from the eShop.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Version 21.0.0 borked compatibility</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="dc2f3f1430d2e"><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc2f3f1430d2e/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have already seen some reports claiming third-party docks are no longer compatible with the Switch 2. These stories started popping up after Nintendo rolled out a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major system update</a> earlier this week, which bumped its new hybrid device up to Version 21.0.0.</p>
<p>We've investigated this with a quick test of one of the devices we have on hand (specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/antank-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-a-decent-little-travel-dock">S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank</a>), and it appears to be functioning as normal. It seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/switch_2_3rd_party_dock_issues_after_recent/">we might not be alone here</a>, but it's now got us wondering how it's been going for <em>other</em> third-party dock users since Nintendo rolled out the latest updates.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186280 @ 1763113455 -->
<p>Some of the advice being shared online at the moment is to hold off updating your system if you've got a third-party dock. Certain manufacturers have also issued notices advising users to avoid the latest firmware update while they work on dock fixes, and a handful of companies have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/comment/nokyxir/">supposedly already overcome any issues</a>. This apparently includes new updates for Hagibis, Jemdo and Jsaux-branded docks.</p>
<p>We've previously acknowledged how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">there could be an "ongoing battle"</a> between Nintendo and third-party dock makers, and unless it's an officially licensed product, there's always going to be a chance Nintendo could take action. And we've even seen some fans now claiming their official Switch 2 dock is now experiencing problems after this latest firmware update.</p>
<p>So, how has your Switch 2 third-party dock experience been so far? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Join in on the fun this weekend</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d5cc7d4d9aed9"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5cc7d4d9aed9/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, Nintendo kicked off its 'Global Test Ride' demo for the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>Now, ahead of the next test window, Nintendo has released a new patch, bumping the demo up to <strong>Version 1.0.1</strong>. It addresses multiple issues, so the pink puff and his fellow racers can hopefully look forward to improved conditions on the track this weekend.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Kirby Air Riders: Ver. 1.0.1 (Released 13th November, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Addressed the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where City Trial matching sometimes did not successfully connect after a long period of time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where City Trial matches would sometimes not start properly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where other players’ games might not progress, such as a player experiencing a communication error in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may still experience matching and communication issues after this update. If a match does not start after 90 seconds or more on the matching screen, try exiting the matching screen. If you cannot exit, try restarting the software.</p>

<p>During an <a href="https://youtu.be/VZ33zDaH1-w">interview with Kyle Bosman recently</a>, Circana's video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella revealed the new entry in the series is "so far" the "best-selling" physical release in the US this year, while noting how Pokémon (in general) continues to be an unstoppable force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mat Piscatella:</strong> "Pokémon is the biggest media property around right now, it's leading in our toys tracking, the trading cards are one of the biggest drivers of the entire toy industry right now...it's broken all containment from the video game world in terms of the franchise strength.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kzsipo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>"It's the best-selling physical game of the year so far already and it's only been in the market a few weeks. It's going to be one of the big drivers of the holiday quarter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not long after the new game's release on the Switch and Switch 2, The Pokémon Company revealed the anticipated title had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-sold-5-8-million-copies-globally-in-its-first-week">shifted more than 5.8 million copies worldwide</a> in its first week.</p>
<p>However, not all regions have necessarily reflected the same level of success, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">Z-A's retail sales in Europe</a> reportedly the smallest for the main Pokémon games since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee!</a>.</p>
<p>Although this latest Pokémon entry is available as a <em>proper</em> physical game on the Switch 2, earlier this week, it was revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> would launch on Nintendo's new hardware as a Game-Key Card release, which could potentially impact sales of the title.</p>
