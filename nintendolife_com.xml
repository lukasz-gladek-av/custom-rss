<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/sunsoftgames/status/1965958472945565993">brief post on social media today</a>, it revealed plans to share some important news.

<p>The team at Digital Extremes recently shared a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/lhMk-jfl1m8">development update</a>, and it seems work on the Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50930-warframe-devs-can-t-wait-to-make-switch-2-version-still-waiting-for-dev-kit">which was originally teased in July during TennoCon 2025</a>) is now underway.</p>
<p>Here's what the company's CEO Steve Sinclair had to say about this, after previously mentioning in July how the team couldn't wait <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50930-warframe-devs-can-t-wait-to-make-switch-2-version-still-waiting-for-dev-kit">to get its hands on a dev kit</a> (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52692-warframe-devs-reveal-switch-2-version-currently-in-the-works">via GoNintendo</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pxsoml&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"We are working on Switch 2 stuff by the way. I don’t think that needs to be secret anymore. We finally have… thanks to our friends at Nintendo, we are on it, and there’s a lot of amazing things that are happening…</p>
<p>"…It is a very impressive piece of kit. Our tech leads are working on and are very excited about it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital Extremes Creative Director Rebecca Ford added to this, mentioning how the team would potentially capture gameplay of this particular version of Warframe and share it in an upcoming development stream.</p>
<p>This online third-person action shooter was previously released on the original Switch in 2018, and at the time, we called it a remarkable technical feat for Nintendo's hybrid hardware. This particular port was handled by the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/feature_sitting_down_with_panic_button_nintendo_switchs_most_important_third-party_studio">talented team at Panic Button</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 this year, Capcom also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> just before the arrival of the new Nintendo hardware.</p>
<p>Last month, this same collection of classics received a "free title update" - unlocking additional characters in <strong>Street Fighter Alper 3 UPPER</strong> and also adding quality of life upgrades, new artwork and more remix tracks. Now, this package has been updated again for all platforms (including Switch).</p>
<p>It includes fixes across multiple games. Here's the full rundown via Capcom's official website:</p>
<h3>Capcom Fighting Collection (Version 1.0.4) - 9th September 2025</h3>
<p>Update Contents</p>
<p><strong>Capcom vs. SNK 2 Mark of the Millennium 2001</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Edmond Honda's voice would not play for certain victory poses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where M. Bison's Head Press and Somersault Skull Diver attacks would not hit Eagle, Maki, Yun, or Ingrid.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where R. Mika's Sardine Beach Special attack would not correctly hit Eagle, Maki, Yun, or Ingrid.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Versus Mode when battling against CPUs where the opponent's mode would switch to Normal in rounds after the player won a round in Classic or Saikyo mode.</li>
<li>Updated certain victory text for Juni.</li>
<li>Implemented various fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Justice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain Kurow voice lines would not play.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>And in case you're wondering, this collection has also been made compatible with the Switch 2 in a previous update. This update took place alongside a Switch 2 update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection</a>.</p>

<p>Acclaim is back, and earlier today, it welcomed in a "new era" with its very own showcase. If you didn't tune in, don't worry – we've got you covered here on Nintendo Life with a quick round up.</p>
<p>Although there is only one game confirmed for a Nintendo platform at the time of writing (that's <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/basketball_classics">Basketball Classics</a></strong> for the Switch), there were a bunch of <em>other</em> "exciting" new games announced that will be getting console releases in the future. However, specific platforms for each of these titles have not been confirmed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We’re ecstatic to relaunch Acclaim with a lineup that captures our legacy of bold creativity and delivers fresh, unforgettable experiences,”</em> said Alex Josef, CEO of Acclaim. <em>“These games are just the beginning of our mission to redefine fun for players everywhere."</em></p>
