<figure data-uuid="8c0db7dfabaf5"><a title="Game-Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c0db7dfabaf5/game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game-Key Cards have been perhaps the hottest topic of the Switch 2's lifecycle so far. Outside of particularly large releases, the running theory is that many studios are turning to a Game-Key physical release because Nintendo has failed to offer small/cheap options for those who don't want to cough up for the big 64GB cartridges. But that might be about to change.</p>
<p>A rumour making the rounds online today states that Nintendo will soon introduce 16 and 32GB cartridge options, so smaller devs hoping to launch a physical release won't have to turn to Key Cards as the only financially viable way of making it happen.</p>
<p>That is according to both the game preservation community <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1">Does It Play</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SoWhatAboutGame">Physical Paradise</a> on Twitter, the latter of which claims to have been informed of the introduction by two separate sources.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" tabindex="-1">@Nintendeal</a> also claimed to have heard the same information, though it pointed out that increasing material costs and chip shortages mean there's no guarantee that more cart size options will directly affect pricing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Ubisoft employee Rob Bantin explained</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had launched on Switch 2 as a GKC, not because of a cost issue, but because the S2 carts "simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". To be clear, different cart <em>sizes</em> would do nothing to mend this issue, but they would provide an alternative for smaller games that are less reliant on speedy asset streaming.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nothing more than a rumour for the time being, so make sure to take things with a hefty pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Something that isn't rumoured, however, is the physical launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a>, which ININ Games has today announced will be arriving as a Game-Key Card since "switching entirely to cartridges would significantly raise manufacturing costs and increase the retail price by at least 15€".</p>
<p>"To avoid this, we chose to release the game on a key card while continuing to explore alternative solutions for the Special and Collector’s Edition," the publisher wrote in an explanation post on <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2001279550135644222">Twitter</a>. "There is still hope for a real cartridge, and we are trying everything."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether more cart sizes from Nintendo will actually impact the number of Game-Keys on the market, or whether studios will continue to stick firmly to the download option. We'll be keeping an eye out for more developments in this particular rumour, and will update you should we hear anything.</p>

<p>In his monthly thread detailing sales figures and retail highlights, Piscatella confirms that a total of 1.6 million hardware units were sold across all platforms in the US during November. This is the lowest total since 1995, during which a total of 1.4 million units were sold.</p>
<p>To potentially explain this figure, Piscatella also notes that the average price paid for a new piece of hardware was "an all-time November high of $439", which is up 11% compared to a year ago.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7znxryi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the data a bit closer, the PS5 managed to beat the Switch 2 to be the highest-selling platform during November, which is the first time Sony has managed such a feat since the launch of Nintendo's new console. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/xbox-series-xs-had-no-black-friday-deals-so-they-lost-to-a-console-weve-never-heard-of-us">the NEX Playground came in third place</a> in units sold, though the Xbox managed to bag third in dollars.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the highest-selling game of the month was, rather predictably, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Nintendo's highest-charting title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
