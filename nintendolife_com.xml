<p>Well, except one</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom doesn't seem to be in any rush to put its classic <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games on the Switch or Switch 2. And when we say 'classic', we're primarily talking about the original PS1 trilogy, maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Code: Veronica</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil_survivor">Survivor</a>, etc...</p>
<p>With that in mind, developer Unclear Games is looking to fill the gap with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/florist">The Florist</a>, a survival horror launching on the Switch 2 in 2026 alongside Steam and the PS5 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/retro-resident-evil-fans-will-want-to-pay-attention-to-the-florist-on-ps5">Push Square</a>). Boasting fixed camera angles and a wildly unsettling atmosphere, it's a blatant callback to classic RE in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Well... except one. In the description for the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">Steam</a>, it notes that you'll have access to an unlimited inventory – <em>"pick up anything and everything"</em> – and that just seems kinda wild to us. Having a limited inventory is a huge part of the identity of survival horror, and it's something that Resident Evil has carried throughout its existence (to a much lesser degree in some entries, granted).</p>
<p>We're definitely concerned about this, but we'll of course reserve full judgement for now. Otherwise, we're really enamoured with the presentation here. The bold colours represent a pretty drastic departure from what you'd expect a survival horror to look like, and we suspect at least a bit of inspiration has been taken from Konami's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a>. Not a bad thing at all, in our opinion.</p>
<p>So, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fixed cameras to evoke tension and showcase beautiful artwork<br>
- Puzzles to test perception, deduction and creativity<br>
- Powerful and explosive weapons to defeat enemies<br>
- A world that grows and changes throughout the game<br>
- Unlimited inventory - pick up anything and everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Resident Evil fans will be well catered for in 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> all launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Rumours are also gaining pace that points to a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a>, with a voice actor including a now-deleted entry for a lead role in 'Project Chamber' in his résumé, which is said to be the working title for the remake.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-hit-the-brakes-so-hard-last-quarter-even-rise-outsold-it</link>

<figure data-uuid="f77e8d5ceb611"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds / Rise" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f77e8d5ceb611/monster-hunter-wilds-rise.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has today shared its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">financial results</a> for Q2 of FY2025/26, and the software sales numbers have left us rubbing our eyes and pulling a double take — is that the four-year-old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> putting up more new sales than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, yes it is. As noted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/monster-hunter-wilds-doing-so-badly-thats-its-been-outsold-by-mh-rise-devil-may-cry-5">Push Square</a>, there's a rather amusing wrinkle in the studio's Digital Contents Unit Sales Ranking this time around. Series newbie Monster Hunter Wilds — which shifted <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/monster-hunter-wilds-smashes-capcom-record-with-10-million-units-sold">10 million units</a> in its record-breaking opening weeks, let's not forget — is at the bottom of the pile with 637,000 sales in the first half of the fiscal year, while Rise is one spot above it with 643,000 sales.</p>
<p>That might not be a huge gap on paper, but it's exacerbated when we look at Q2 in isolation. Of those 637,000 sales, 477,000 came in <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">Q1</a>, meaning Wilds only shifted an additional 160,000 copies in the months since. Rise, on the flip side, managed 254,000 sales in the same period — a slight decline from the 389,000 sold in Q1, but what do you expect, it's <em>four years old</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4065e85c9a446"><a title="Capcom Q2 FY2025 Unit Sales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4065e85c9a446/capcom-q2-fy2025-unit-sales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">Capcom</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, the two Monster Hunters sit firmly at the bottom of the pile, outsold by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which put up 547,000 sales in Q2) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which actually sold the most units in Q2 (643,000), despite still falling behind <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a> on the fiscal year as a whole.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a bunch of reasons why Wilds might be falling behind Rise, despite being the <em>much</em> newer of the two — the latter's availability on more platforms and readily available bonus content, for example — but it's still kind of crazy to see how much the sales have dropped off after Capcom's stellar launch earlier this year.</p>
<p>You'll notice that a bunch of the titles in the above list will be making their way to Switch 2 before the fiscal year is up (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a> and Village will join <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> on the hybrid on 27th February), so it'll be interesting to see what that does to the total unit sales. Outside of that, we'll be keeping our fingers crossed for news of mainline MonHun coming our way at some point in the future.</p>
