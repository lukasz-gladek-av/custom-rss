<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b0dd8eca985a/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to August, folks! Let's kick things off right with a fresh edition of What Are You Playing.</p>
<p>It was Direct week over in Nintendo Land, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> delivering us 25 minutes of... meh. There were some big hitters that we're pleased to see (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>), but we were hoping to be a <em>little</em> more excited by the whole affair.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, new card art in Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-pulls-new-expansion-card-art-amid-accusations-of-plagiarism">landed TPC in hot water</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> made a surprise appearance on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and Microsoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-2025">playable at Gamescom</a> — we're <em>totally</em> not envious of everyone getting to go hands-on with it...</p>
<p>We also shared our thoughts on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">Time Flies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was...</a></p>
<p>Now then, what's team NL up to this weekend?</p>

<p>I am feeling very much <em>BetweenGamesTM</em> at the moment after polishing off DK and all its related guides. I was hoping to have a little something drop my way in the Direct, but left feeling pretty uninspired, if I'm honest. I'll defo check out the Elliot demo this weekend, and the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">free Switch 2 update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III</a> has me keen for some more HD-2D action.</p>
<p>Have a good one, friends!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>There aren't many changes in my gaming habits from last week, folks! I'm in the endgame of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and, let me tell you, they've definitely saved the best until last, I'm going to 100% this big banana and nothing is going to stop me from doing so.</p>
<p>I did pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date</a>, even though reviews seem a little lower and I was pretty disappointed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a> (I know that's not a common opinion; I'm sorry!). Still, I love these characters enough that I want to spend more time with them. We'll see! Have a good one!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I’m gonna be digging into a few different things that I’ve picked up in the sale, and I won’t feel bad about telling you that one of them is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">FC 25</a>. I just really needed an on-the-go footie fix, even if it is running at 30fps on my Switch 2.</p>
<p>In much nicer news, I’ll also be having a blast on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, which I picked up despite it not scoring quite as highly as I’d hoped in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. I’ve also been making progress in The Hundred Line - Last Defence Academy and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, so both of those will get some loving too.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is going to be hard to hold out on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on Steam, but I really want to play this one on consoles. I did start making progress on Donkey Kong Bananza, and it is such a cathartic experience. Moving on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a> while still progressing my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> World Tour save and moving upward to battle 25 on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. The end game is still a long way off...</p>
<p>My game of the week is the incredible, shrewd move by SEGA! In an assault worthy of a true ninja, releasing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> demo on the same day <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> got its own release was something out of guerrilla '90s marketing. Said entry in the Ninja Gaiden series is not only my game of the week but one of my GOTY candidates. And by the end of this month, I would write the exact same sentence about Shinobi were I not away on vacation. Truly, this is the Summer of the Ninja!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I was going to do a bunch of garden stuff, but the weather is pants, so that means I'm going to stay inside instead. Now that my Tales of the Shire review is done and dusted, I can go back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>! Yayyyy. I'm on day 80-something, and I hear I have a lot more to do, so I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm trying to keep my video game slate fairly open, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> comes out in a month, so I want to make sure I have time to fit it in.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've been playing <strong>Peak</strong> with friends. Very good, although I'm certainly not very good at it. I really need to work on being a team player and not just flinging myself up at cliff faces, then getting stuck...</p>

<p>Are you ready, kids?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-spongebob-squarepants-is-bringing-a-new-game-to-switch-2">a recent rumour</a>, THQ Nordic and Purple Lamp have now officially lifted the lid on the latest SpongeBob SquarePants game.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> will make its debut across multiple platforms including the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now live for <strong>€39.99 / $39.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a bit about what to expect from the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside standard pre-orders, there'll also be a digital deluxe edition and ultimate edition of the game. These versions will include a Tidal Season Pass (also available for separate purchase).</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Order &amp; Digital Editions</strong><br>
Pre-orders are now live! Digital pre-orders include the <em>Natural Costume Pack DLC</em> as a bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: Base game</li>
<li>Digital Deluxe Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass</li>
<li>Ultimate Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass + Natural Costume Pack + SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake - Costume Pack (DLC)</li>
</ul>
<div><p><strong>Tidal Season Pass (also available separately)</strong><br>
The Tidal Season Pass includes two DLC packs with new challenge levels and two themed costume packs:</p><p>

Challenge DLCs:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Plankton’s Portal Challenge DLC</li>
<li>Search for SquarePants DLC</li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmetic Packs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for SquarePants Costume Pack</li>
<li>Double Deluxe Costume Pack</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collector’s Edition – Ghostly Edition</strong><br>
For true fans and collectors, the Ghostly Edition delivers hauntingly good extras:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em><em>: Titans of the Tide</em> – Digital Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>Exclusive Steelbook</li>
<li>Collectible Patch</li>
