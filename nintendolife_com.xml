<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f52c8599a65/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's now well over a month since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch#conclusion-should-you-get-a-switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s June launch, and it seems the majority of owners are happy with their new console. Gripes about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">the screen</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-we-put-the-switch-2s-battery-through-its-paces-with-a-full-timelapse">battery life</a>, and how quickly the internal memory fills up are all valid, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">the general consensus</a> indicates that the joys outweigh the cons; it's a neat system and we're having a brilliant time with it.</p>
<p>Slow download speeds is another area that has been frustrating some people, although it appears to be far from a universal problem. Asking around the Nintendo Life team, our Switch 2 internet speeds across the board either equal our old Switches or they're faster, significantly faster in some cases. But some Switch 2 users online — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/switch_2_game_download_speeds_via_wifi_are_slower_than_switch_1_in_spite_of_the_newer_faster_hardware">on our forums</a> — have been encountering connection issues, with eShop downloads sometimes taking multiple hours.</p>
<p>Now, one of the many problems with diagnosing and solving download issues is the number of variables involved. I could quote you my WiFi down/upload speeds standing across the room from my router (81.5 Mbps down, 46.6 Mbps up - you can run a test yourself via your Switch 2's System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Test Connection), but that's not much help when you have a different ISP package with different limits and a router with different capabilities and settings.</p>
<p>Physically connecting your dock to your router via the Ethernet port is an obvious thing to try. Looking around online, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbivpQlpc4Y">people have recommended</a> changing your connection settings by upping the MTU value from the default 1400 to 1500 (which increases the packet size and potentially boosts download speeds). Try System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Internet Settings&gt;[your network]&gt;Change Settings&gt;MTU for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82c2c4ac44d69/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1l6aurs/comment/mzi7hig">Shonryu79</a> suggested disabling 'IPv6 Connection' via the same settings menu, and several people apparently saw their download speeds leap after that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, people have fiddled with manual DNS settings and tried power cycling — which, for the non-technically minded, is the posh term for turning it on and off again — to mixed results. Again, with so many factors potentially influencing your connection speeds, a one-fix-for-all solution isn't likely.</p>
<p>Nintendo has its own <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/troubleshooting-slow-download-and-upload-speeds-on-nintendo-switch-2">Troubleshooting Slow Download Speeds page</a>, which I'll paraphrase thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>'Move closer to the router'</em></li>
<li><em>'Move other metal and electronic things away from your console'</em></li>
<li><em>'Connect to a different wireless band'</em></li>
<li><em>'Turn your router off and on again'</em></li>
<li><em>'Update your router's firmware'</em></li>
<li><em>'Still nothing? Contact your Internet Service Provider'</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm. The first four are definitely worth a shot, but Nintendo doesn't offer any Switch 2 settings tweaks to potentially solve the problem. And, personally, I'd rather eat my own foot than initiate any contact whatsoever with my ISP.</p>
<p>Have you had any download speed issues with Switch 2? We're keen to get an idea of how widespread the issue is and try to narrow down whether there is an issue with the console itself that Nintendo could potentially address, or if it's the many and various other internet factors causing upset. Let us know in the poll below, and feel free to share with the community any solutions you've found to Switch 2 connection woes.</p>

<p>Fair play</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9650f1602f54c/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember when GameStop made the news following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">unfortunate incident involving a newly-bought Switch 2 console and a stapler</a>? Yeah, one store thought it wise to staple receipts onto the Switch 2 box, puncturing the cardboard and damaging the screen of the Switch inside.</p>
<p>It wasn't a good look for the company, but now, GameStop is looking to turn the whole thing into a positive by auctioning off the stapler and the damaged Switch 2 on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, with all proceeds going to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play! Yes, it's a massive publicity stunt to save face, but it's a decent one at that, and bidding has already reached <strong>$108,895</strong> at the time of writing with over 6 days remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">GameStop tried to make light of the whole situation</a> in the days following the staple incident, but wound up getting into even more trouble when it became evident the company used someone else's photo without providing credit. It posted a joke announcing restocks of the Switch 2 along with the tagline "Staples not included", but the photo used belonged to Janelle Jones of Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Water under the bridge, and all that. GameStop gets a lot wrong, but this might be one of those rare occasions in which it's made a pretty good decision. Keep going.</p>

<p>But more games will be made eligible</p>

<figure><a title="Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e41d8659b2591/game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be ceasing sales of the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme from <strong>Friday, 30th January 2026 at 23:59 JST</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who might be unaware, Game Vouchers would come in pairs and would therefore allow you to purchase two first-party eShop titles at a discounted price. So in the UK, for example, a pair of Game Vouchers costs £84, granting access to two titles priced at £49.99 each, thus saving you approximately £16. Pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>No more, though! Nintendo had already announced that Game Vouchers wouldn't be compatible with the Switch 2, but now it's gone one step further and is bringing an end to the scheme entirely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pzgkjy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>It's not all bad news, though. Sort of... Game Vouchers are valid for one year after purchase, and Nintendo has stated that it will be introducing more games to the scheme following the cessation of sales at the start of January.</p>
<p>We can't say for definite which games might be added, but we reckon there's a good chance we'll see the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, both of which are scheduled to launch in 2026. Then, of course, you've got the Switch 1 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> launching later this year.</p>
<p>It's a shame this will no longer be a thing, though. Hopefully Nintendo will offer up some sort of alternative for the Switch 2, because if it wants to continue pushing folks toward digital purchases, then it'll need to introduce an enticing deal for those hesitant to leave physical media behind.</p>
