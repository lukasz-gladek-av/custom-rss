It's only just beat <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but if you also take into account the PS5 sales at number five, then its lead is considerably more substantial.</p>
<p>We've got a few new releases this week, including the boxed version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a> at number seven. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also performing well, resulting in yet another week in which <em>two</em> MK titles have made the top ten.

<p>Hardware this week yields no change in the top ten, with the Switch 2 once again claiming the top spot. Cumulative Switch sales reach 18,637 units this week, while the PS5 has managed a total of 7,141. So yes, despite Nintendo launching a <em>brand new console</em>, mind you, the previous-gen Switch managed to outsell the PS5 by more than 2:1.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-apex-legends-switch-2-a-giant-leap-over-the-tragic-switch-1-version.1264971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. I feel like I have to remind myself of that sometimes, as I'm so bored off my face with shooters in general, and don't really play online competitively anymore. I just can't be bothered with the stress and/or real emotion of it all.</p>
<p>However, Apex Legends, once I get over myself and turn it on, does stuff that pleases my monkey brain quite a lot. Back in 2019 when it released, which feels like centuries ago now, I couldn't believe how clever, simple, and obvious this hero shooter's ping system was. How hadn't anyone done this before? It's a game that's built with no-fuss, unobtrusive teamwork at its core. And it makes it a blast for anyone to have fun with.</p><!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/accessibility-report/2700/embed @ 1754590314 -->
<p>The roster of hero characters, which is now enormous compared to when I last played it, is hugely varied, and they all have amplified and incredibly moreish methods of traversal. It's all very zippy, cloaky, boost-jumpy, and very, very fast. The movement and controls and shooting and zooming around collecting stuff endlessly is just as pleasing as the pings. I know you know all of this already, I'm just saying.</p>
<p>Back on Switch 1, Apex Legends managed to arrive feature-complete. However, it was laid low by terrible performance issues. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/apex_legends">I gave it a 5/10</a>, saying it was still fun to play, but had notable frame rate issues, muddy textures, unresponsive and laggy controls...yeah, it was basically a really tragic Switch port.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about any of this now, though. We can concentrate on having a good time with what's surely still one of the very best (if not <em>the</em> best) hero shooter, Battle Royale...eh, thingies out there. It really is that good. I've used my unlock tokens to grab all but three of the full roster, and I've fallen down the rabbit hole once more.</p>
<p>Because, much like how its ping system originally dazzled me, this Switch 2 port has dazzled me all over again by being perhaps the very first fully-fledged and functionally perfect online shooter that I've ever sat and played on my sofa on a portable console. Yes, there are other great online shooter games on Switch, like the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> series, but this scratches a very different shooter itch. And it's free!</p>
<p>In docked and handheld, performance feels great on Switch 2, and bar the odd hiccup as you load into a stage, this is silky smooth stuff, even during busy firefights. It looks perfectly crisp and clear at <em>all times</em>. Add in motion controls for fine-tuning your snipes, a bonus mouse-mode that's fun (I'm still using the normal controls, mind), and you've got a version of Apex Legends that, despite all of its hard-selling of Apex Points and outfits, is very, very hard to pick a hole in.</p>
<p>In fact, Apex Legends redeems itself on Switch 2. This upgraded version gives us 60fps shooting action with crisp, clear resolutions and none of that juddery, unresponsive, blurry stuff we had back in 2021. It's still the best hero shooter/Battle Royale out there for me, with amazingly fluid traversal, best-in-class gunfeel, and a ping system that puts proper teamwork and tactics front and centre. The cherry on top, of course, is that it's free to play, too, so there's no good reason for shooter fans not to dive right in.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends]]></content:encoded>

<p>And is that a mouse mode tease?</p>

<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78b01dc5b84de/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games kicked off today's Indie World showcase strongly by announcing that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mina-the-hollower-yacht-clubs-retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-scores-switch-2-release-date">coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 31st October 2025</a>. And you might be wondering, <em>'what does a Switch 2 version of a pixel art game entail?'</em> Well, let us — and the developer — inform you.</p>
<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/mina-the-hollower-launches-on-nintendo-switch-1-2-on-oct-31-play-the-demo-now-/">Yacht Club Games' website</a>, the team confirmed that the Switch 2 version of the game supports 120fps, an extremely tasty prospect for those with the new console. You can also spy 120hz and HDR output <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">at the bottom of the eShop page</a>. And hey, there's a native Switch 2 demo, so that's worth checking out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/Em_IP-6snrs?si=cpGJ6X0nKTk6ngyn">our friends over at GVG have a comparison video</a> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Switch 1</a>'s 60fps release and the Switch 2's 120. Have a watch of it below.</p>

<p>And, since Mina the Hollower is all about a mouse, it would make sense to have <em>some</em> kind of mouse compatibility, right? Well, fear not, as Yacht Club Games seems to be teasing <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Mina the Hollower, you ARE the mouse! But we heard that if you turn your Joy-Con 2 on its side while playing and move it around, <em>something</em> may happen.."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, well, well... Yacht Club Games is the Big Cheese of the retro throwback, so we expect great things, especially given that this one's clearly inspired by the top-down Game Boy Color games of the early '90s.</p>
<p><em>Will you be getting Mina the Hollower on Switch 1 or Switch 2? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>
