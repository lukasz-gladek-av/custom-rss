<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4c73a00baf37/terminator-2d-no-fate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Reef Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed due to coordination and manufacturing issues with the physical release.</p>
<p>Now coming on <strong>31st October 2025</strong> — as opposed to its original 5th September release date — publisher Reef apologised for the delay and thanked fans "for bearing with us".</p>
<p>The delay affects both the physical and digital version of the game, and will allow "the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself".</p>
<p>"We would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> together", Reef concludes, praising fans hype and support for the pixel art arcade-style game.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to wait; this is one of our most-anticipated games of the year, so while we're champing at the bit to get our hands on it, we're sure the final game will be worth it.</p>
<p>We spent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-like-on-steroids-versus-our-previous-titles-how-terminator-2d-no-fate-changes-the-past-and-future">a good chunk of time chatting to the devs of Terminator 2D</a> about how the game is much, <em>much</em> bigger than anything Bitmap has tackled before, and just how you balance inspiration with faithfulness.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the delay in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>And it's not long after other versions</p>

<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c34c895667b32/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, announced for Switch 2 back in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct in April, finally has a release date on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<p>We've known about the game's release date on PC, PS5, and Xbox for a while now, but in a video posted on social media, Randy Pitchford has confirmed that the Switch 2 version will follow shortly afterwards — on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pitchford manages to draw out the reveal in the video posted on X earlier today, but eventually alleviates fans' concerns about the game's portable port.</p>

<p>So, we'll have to wait just an extra three weeks to get our hands on this one. Not bad at all!</p>
<p>Thankfully this was much better news than what has previously been circling Gearbox founder and CEO Pitchford previously. The industry icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/randy-pitchford-defends-borderlands-4-pricing-comment">was forced to defend a statement</a> he made about game prices where he said "if you're a real fan, you'll find a way", in response to a potential $80 price tag.</p>
