			<p>It is about time some fresh 3D platformers to turn up, bringing with them fresh ideas and new ways to enjoy the genre. Big Hops is a game that comes with some big and fun new ideas, like using a frog tongue as a grapple to latch onto points and to grab items from the environment, and using different plants for fun ways to get around the world. But as it’s leaping from platform to plant, jumping through the world, can it stick the landing?</p>
<p><iframe title="BIG HOPS - Announce Trailer | A new kind of 3D platformer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd7WIf1peRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Hops follows the story of a young frog called Hop who lives his simple, quiet life in the forest with his sister and mum. However, he soon hears a voice calling to him away from his usual stomping grounds to a shrine where he is asked to bring some things to fix the altar. Unfortunately, the voice belongs to the being known as Diss who whisks Hop away to different worlds where he must find Dark Drips to assist Diss, as well as Airship Parts to get back home. The lesson here is that you shouldn’t listen to disembodied voices promising a good time – embodied voices can also be pretty problematic.</p>


<p>Hop visits three very different worlds from his home, including a desert inhabited by rabbit people, an island chain inhabited by otters, and a mountain inhabited by bats. Diss brings Hop to each of these places because there is conflict at each one which draws in the Dark Drips. In the desert, the regular townsfolk are in conflict with a gang, in the islands it is a between one person and the oil company DrillCo, and in the mountains it is punks railing against authority. Three very different conflicts and each one is presented decently, with a wide cast of characters that are brought to life by good voice performances. Each of the locations also look great, filled with vibrant colour and well mapped environments that show where you need to go, but letting you test different ways of getting to points of interest.</p>


<p>Big Hops gameplay has the classic hallmarks of 3D platformers providing open spaces to explore to find collectables, solve puzzles, and assist people in their endeavours. Where Big Hops differs is through its traversal and puzzle solving. As Hop is a frog he has a long and powerful tongue that can latch onto surfaces allowing him to swing across gaps, pull levers from a distance, pick locks, and even engage in a bit of light graffiti.</p>
<p>As if his tongue wasn’t enough, Hops can also make use of a number of plants and vegetables, each of which has its own properties and affect the way you can navigate the world. Mushrooms can be used as bounce pad, a cacti plant can create rope crossings, and the flux plant creates zones of low gravity. These are just three of a wider number of plants that can be used to solve puzzles and find different ways of getting around, though some are exclusive to each area. Hop does get a backpack to store these items in, but space is limited so you won’t be able to carry every plant with you.</p>

<p>In each area, Hop has to try to resolve the local conflict to find the airship parts he needs and to move on to the next world. Much of the gameplay consists of solving big puzzles, usually three, to unlock the path to move forward. There are also secondary tasks available to tackle, but they are not required to move on. Your focus is looking for Dark Drips and solving the issues of the region.</p>
<p>Dark Drips are needed to unlock additional bonuses for Hop, be it additional stamina for climbing, more health, or compasses to locate more Drips in the world. Every time you find a Dark Drip you can take it back to Diss and choose between two bonuses. I wouldn’t agonise too much over the choice as you will eventually get all of them. The worlds also contain hidden challenge rooms where you have to use what you have learned in that world to navigate treacherous paths to grab a Dark Drip.</p>

<p>I initially really enjoyed my time with Big Hops and there are some really fun moments, but through the review period we did run into a number of issues on PS5. One area had stuttering performance, there was some clipping through the environment, skipping music, and more significantly some game crashes and progression-blocking issues. Patches arrived before launch to address most of these, allowing me to finish the game, though I wasn’t able to return to previous areas and did still run into a glitch that locked me into a first person view – this resolved itself when I failed the level. Hopefully remaining issues at launch are patched quickly, because they did detract from my experience of an otherwise charming game.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Big Hops is a good new 3D platformer that will draw plenty of fans with its fun abilities and locations to explore. My playthrough was affected by bugs, with patches coming to address some of these issues in the run up to launch, but there seem to be some teething issues that remain.	</p></div>

		<p>Any game series is going to need to adapt and reinvent itself after a few entries, but few have been quite so transformative as Resident Evil. Through its many sequels and spin-offs, this horror series always keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat.</p>
<p>A big part of horror is building up the anticipation and the scares, to not reveal everything about the monstrosities that are terrifying our protagonists. Capcom took that to heart for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem’s</a> announcement as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At its reveal, there was plenty of mystery about the new leading lady that Capcom had featured. Grace Ashcroft might be an FBI agent, but she’s more of a desk-bound analyst than a field agent. A cruel twist of fate sees her assigned to investigate the Renwood Hotel, the same hotel in which her mother was murdered, dragging her back to Resident Evil’s original stomping ground of Raccoon City.</p>
<p>There’s good reason for this, because<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/"> as Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>So Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, forcing her to evade and hide instead. This was the scene for our hands on preview in the middle of last year, as I guided Grace through dark hallways, looking to reach puddles of light, to keep my noise to a minimum for fear of the hulking beast that was stalking me.</p>
<h3>Further Reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">RE Requiem Preview – first person frights, third person delights</a></h3>
<p>But then comes the twist because… well, why not have Leon in the game too?</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T54OWinnymM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Leon will be featured in Resident Evil Requiem, his story intertwined with Grace’s, letting her handle all the tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action. How nice of him.</p>
<p>One of the great things for Resident Evil Requiem is that, where previous games have made the choice for you, Requiem can be played in both first person and third person from day one –&nbsp;Village added this choice through DLC. The game also looks to push a new generation of the RE Engine that has powered so many of Capcom’s games over the past decade.</p>
<p>Thankfully the wait for this one isn’t too long. Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
