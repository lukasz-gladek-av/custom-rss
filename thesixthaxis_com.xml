		<p>With Bungie building up to the launch of their new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, the studio has been accused of plagiarising art for their game, with examples found within videos and screenshots of the game’s alpha build. Bungie has responded to these accusations and put the blame on a former artist, pledging to perform a review of in-game assets and to implement stricter checks on contributions going forward.</p>
<p>Digital artist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antire.al/post/3lpa4gamtzs2l">Antireal took to social media</a> to highlight that their work was being lifted by Bungie yesterday, higlighting some key examples where glyphs and sections of posters created in 2017 were being used as decals and textures in Marathon.</p>

<p>In response, Bungie used their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonteam.bungie.net/post/3lpb36jqb5c22">@MarathonDevTeam accounts</a> (their account with 10,300 followers on Twitter, instead of 117,700 for @MarathonTheGame or 2.8 million for @Bungie) to issue the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game</em>.</p>

<p><em>“This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</em></p>
<p><em>“To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>“We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</em></p>
<p>We hope that financial renumeration and credit is on the table as a part of “doing right by them”.</p>
<p>While plagiarism is a massive no-no, taking inspiration and copying idea is pretty much inevitable. It is fair to say, of course, that art is constantly evolving and drawing upon previous work for inspiration. You could just as easily draw a line back to the Wipeout franchise for the style of their glyphs and general designs, while <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-art-style-mirrors-edge-ghost-in-the-shell/">Marathon Art Director Joseph Cross has publicly noted Mirror’s Edge, Ghost in the Shell and others as inspirations</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is deeply disappointing as Bungie has been caught doing similar things in the past. In 2021 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pvu64p/bungie_accidentally_used_someones_fan_art_of_xivu/">Bungie used fan art in a Destiny 2 trailer</a>, and then for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/14evilb/bungie_stole_someones_art_for_the_new_cutscene/">another Destiny 2 cutscene in 2023</a>, and then ended up <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">compensating an artist after using their work for the physical Destiny 2 Nerf Blaster</a>.</p>

			<p>There’s an argument to be had about when Capcom’s brightest moment has been. Was it in the 90s, where Street Fighter 2 practically inventing the fighting scene, while Resident Evil lurched into people’s consciousness? Or perhaps it’s happening right now, with huge franchise hits like Monster Hunter Wilds and Dragons Dogma 2 sitting alongside more esoteric offerings like Kunitsu-Gami.</p>
<p>For me, many of Capcom’s best moments came in the early noughties when they were firing our hits for the Sega Dreamcast like Power Stone, Project Justice and Capcom vs SNK. As luck would have it, that’s the period covered by Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and there’ll be fewer arguments about when the brightest moment was, because it’s now, today, as you can play all of these games on modern hardware, whenever, and wherever you want.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Fighting Collection 2 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMlmm9HoDto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Capcom Fighting Collection 2 pulls together eight iconic games that originally launched between 1998 and 2004, comprising the double header of Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and its sequel, Capcom vs SNK 2.0, Power Stone 1 and 2, Plasma Sword and Project Justice, the enhanced version of Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and the lesser-known Capcom Fighting Evolution.</p>
<p>My first stop had to be Project Justice. This was once the jewel in the crown of my physical Dreamcast collection, and the school-based anime-influenced combat is just as alluring as it was originally. The team-up action forces you to think more carefully about your match-ups and how you approach the 3D space, and the character artwork remains simply stunning.</p>


<p>You’ve then got the complete Power Stone experience, with both the original game and its sequel here in full. All the titles here are the arcade versions, and with Power Stone that seems to ensure that the visuals are just that little bit more coherent and smooth. There’s online multiplayer across the board as well, and that’s enough, frankly, to sell us on the entire collection.</p>
<p>Power Stone is a 3D arena battler for up to four players, and it’s simply incredible to have access to it without having to successfully tune in an RF channel on your TV, or figure out ways to emulate your discs. You smash, mash and bash your opponents with everything humanly possible, aiming to power up via collecting gems so you can decimate everyone in front of you. If you’ve been playing recent arena battlers like Party Animals, it’s easy to see the influence that Power Stone had on the genre, and it still holds up today.</p>

<p>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper is the purest Street Fighter experience on display, and there’s definitely an argument to be had that it’s the best Street Fighter game of all time. The animated visuals are simply perfect, the gameplay is unbelievably tight, and the roster is nigh-on perfect. Being able to take it on the go with the Nintendo Switch is brilliant, with the only weak link being the Joy-Con. I may well have just finished off them off with a heavy week of Fighting Collection play.</p>
<p>It’s almost an embarrassment of riches when we arrive at the two Capcom Vs SNK games. These two titles brought together long-time rivals Street Fighter and King of Fighters, giving you the option of different play styles and team make-ups, and let you loose. I spent so much time playing the original versions of these two, and they’re perfectly presented here. As with Power Stone, the sequel is the superior game, but there are some interesting changes to the control scheme between these two to make it worth spending time with both.</p>

<p>The two lesser-known titles for most players will be Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein and Capcom Fighting Evolution (or Jam if you’re from Japan). Plasma Sword is a one-on-one sci-fi 3D fighter which nabbed a Dreamcast port, and many people will know its lead character Hayato from Marvel vs. Capcom 2. The arcade version found here is so much quicker and smoother than the Dreamcast version ever felt, and while the 3D models are a little simplistic when viewed up close, in action they’re still visually exciting and alluring. It’s a great addition to the collection, and something that fewer people will have experienced.</p>
<p>That’s probably even truer for Capcom Fighting Evolution. While it received ports to the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, this has never been considered a top-tier Capcom effort, not least because it’s fundamentally five different games mashed together. There’s characters, art styles and play styles from Street Fighter II, III and Alpha, Darkstalkers and the largely unknown Red Earth, and, though its major draw is letting Ryu fight a dinosaur, it’s far more unbalanced than any other title here. It’s a curiosity, then, and definitely something you’ll want to check out, but there’s less longevity here than the rest of the collection.</p>

<p>Various enhancements make sure that you’re playing the best version of each of these games. From the ability to quick save at any point, access to training modes, rollback netcode for online play, through to the ability to remap controls or perform one-button combos, these games are more welcoming, comprehensive and accessible than ever before. Another great inclusion is access to both the western release and the Japanese version of each title, giving you a complete view of each game, and, if you’re so inclined, the ability to dig into the minutiae of any differences between the two, while there’s over 800 pieces of artwork to pore over in between hitting people in the face.</p>
