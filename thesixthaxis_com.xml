			<p>2020 seems like a lifetime ago, and for the developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/revenge-of-the-savage-planet">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, it probably feels like it’s been even longer. Putting all the real world tumult of the past half decade to one side, Raccoon Logic was known as Typhoon Studios at the time and just on the cusp of releasing their debut title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, when Google came along and bought them up, setting them to work on Google’s Stadia streaming platform. While Journey to the Savage Planet still arrived on other consoles, the Stadia port came not long before Google decided they didn’t want to make games anymore, shutting the studio down, and leaving both them, and the Savage Planet IP, lost in space.</p>
<p>For once, this isn’t a tale where the corporate giants won out. The team re-emerged as Raccoon Logic, reacquired their IP, and set about making a sequel that’s even more Savage than the first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Launch Trailer | Revenge of the Savage Planet | PAX East" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wMoHoFgh9E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was a scouring piece of satire, poking fun at corporate greed and consumerism with genuine humour and wit. It’s fair to say that this is even stronger in the sequel, with the real-world dramas with Google clearly playing into the storytelling, with some of the funniest satirical videos, corporate emails and missives found in gaming.</p>
<p>This theme is no less obvious than during the game’s opening moments, with your plucky space explorer arriving to colonise a new planet under the flag of Alta, an intergalactic mega-corp, only to find that they’re immediately sacked, and that no one else is coming. It’s a poignant and punishing moment for you, your character, and the team, but the clear message from Raccoon Games is that you should just get on with it.</p>

<p>Getting on with it involves shooting a lot of alien creatures, and turning them into a variety of different coloured goo. The menagerie is colourful and creative, and as the name implies, utterly savage. One glimpse and they’ll try to turn you into barbecue, unless you do the same to them first!</p>

<p>Despite the fact that no one is coming to populate the prefabbed units of Nu Florida, you set about building a colony anyway. The core gameplay loop is succinct and satisfying, with a steady stream of missions, upgrades and FMV narrative interludes via the display in your habitat. Fundamentally, this is a Metroidvania, staggering your progress and exploration through upgrades and equipment, and it works as well here as it does anywhere else.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is split into a series of open-world planetary maps. They’re not huge, but they’re packed with plenty of verticality, hidden resources and secrets to keep every moment exciting. I still found myself distracted and wandering off at the merest hint of something else beyond the objective in my eyesight, and though the game can easily be completed in 10 hours, there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had roaming the planets and messing with the creatures within.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes over the original game is the shift to a third-person viewpoint, and for a while, I wasn’t sold, losing some of the immediacy that goes hand-in-hand – should that be eye-in-eye? – with first-person. Eventually, though, you find that the action is more straightforward, the platforming more precise, and there’s the opportunity for more visual gags when you can see your character on-screen. Primary amongst them is the amazingly cartoonish run animation – seriously, it’s unlikely to be bettered for a long time.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that for all of the forlorn, lonely and downright downtrodden emotions surging through the opening of the game, you can play the entirety of it in co-op, both online or via splitscreen. As with pretty much any other multiplayer game, it’s better with a friend, sharing in the hilarity or the humiliation at the hands of a giant crab. There are some limitations – you can’t be on separate planets for example, you’re only progressing one player’s save file, and it’s not seamless drop-in, drop-out, so a co-op session is ended if either of you leaves –&nbsp;but they’re minor foibles that don’t diminish any of the fun and frolics.</p>

<p>Whether in co-op or playing solo, the true high point for Revenge of the Savage Planet remains its sense of humour. It regularly had me in fits of laughter, no doubt upsetting the delicate ears of my co-op partner, and everything, from the ‘juiciest burgers in the world’ advert that has people being sprayed in the face by their food, to the Shama Llama’s Ding Dong Academy that pokes merrily at the influencers’ underbelly – featuring an unexpected cameo from Unbox Therapy’s Lewis Hilsenteger – hits home with clear and cutting intent.</p>
<p>Some of the adverts are so ludicrous, so dystopian, that you can’t believe they’d exist, but as with the best satire, the very fact that they’re even vaguely plausible casts a light on the realities of consumerism, greed and corporate irresponsibility in the modern world. You just have to hope that Raccoon Games are wholly wrong about it all, though I do quite fancy a burger.</p>
<p>There’s some rough edges that we hope are patched out soon, a few minor kinks to the collision detection, a point where the animal capture ability wasn’t working and we needed to reload the save, and other technical hitches, but by and large they don’t affect the enjoyment of the game.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released its financial report for the financial year 2025, and it has some interesting stats. What we know is that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed 152 million units sold, making it second to the Nintendo DS which had over 154 million units sold. When it comes to the Switch 2, Nintendo is forecasting 15 million hardware sales in financial year 2026, which runs from April 1st 2025 to March 31st 2026. On top of that, Nintendo expects 45 million software sales for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>As you would expect, after the Switch 2 launch Nintendo does forecast a drop in sales for the Switch for financial year 2026. The company expects the hardware sales numbers to shrink by 58.3% compared to financial year 2025, to a total of 4.5 million. That would leave the Switch on course to hit 156 million units sold, which would make it the best selling Nintendo console ever. Nintendo also expects a drop in software sales for the Switch by 32.4% to 105 million units from 155.41 million units. The drops in both of these have been forecast to be made up by the Switch 2 hardware and software sales.</p>
<p>Speaking of software, Nintendo confirmed that 24 titles sold over a million copies in financial year 2025, with 15 being first party titles and 9 being third party titles. Of the new titles, Super Mario Party Jamboree hit 7 million sales, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 3.7 million sales, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door 1.9 million sales, both Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD hit 1.6 million sales, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD hit a million sales. For Switch software lifetime sales, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leads the pack with 68.2 million sales, followed in second place by Animal Crossing: New Horizons at 47.82 million sales, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate in third with 36.24 million sales. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has reached 32.81 million sales on Switch, while follow up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is at 21.73 million. Pokémon Scarlet/<br>
Pokémon Violet has hit 26.79 million, just beating Pokémon Sword/Pokémon Shield which came in at 26.72 million sales.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 release date is set for June 5th 2025</a>, so only a month away. Pre-order stock is currently sold out everywhere at the moment.</p>
