		<p>Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas if it didn’t start in November and include a weird advert from PlayStation that shows no games or consoles, so deck those halls and jingle those bells because the ad has arrived.</p>
<p>This year we see lots of young people jumping about, sliding down ramps, and generally engaging in physical activity, the complete opposite of sitting in front of a games console and killing aliens. It’s ‘aspirational’ I guess, maybe you could infer that anything is a game and PlayStation is here to make that true, but as your PS5 is securely tethered to you sofa I think that’s a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc"> one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened thirteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>


<p>These videos are usually packed with Easter Eggs but there just a couple in this new advert. The bus stop at 28 seconds in has 1994-2024 on it, 1994 being the launch year of the PS1. The one that is getting everyone excited is 46 seconds in when a departure board is shown with and at the top is a date and time, 03 12 20:24, so December 3rd this year which is exactly 20 years on from the PS1 launch.</p>

<p>Sony are rumoured to have State of Play in December so some are guessing is that will be the date, it is a week before The Game Awards so Sony could get some big reveals out before the news is swamped with other announcements.</p>
<p>That appears to be it, there are no signs for games in the background, the graffiti does not reference anything, the shops are generic, not even a hint of Crash Bandicoot, all the things Sony usually does in these adverts are missing this year.</p>
<p>Probably the most boring PlayStation advert in history, I bet it cost a fortune to make.</p>

		<p>Embark Studios has released a gameplay reveal trailer for their upcoming survival extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay footage comes from an early tech test that was held in October, following a group of three Raiders as they head out from the human haven of Speranza City and look to explore the surface and the Buried City to find vital resources – each player can have different objectives and goals, it seems.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s other players out there, and if you come across another Raider you can chat using a quick wheel of dialogue options, potentially trying to share the spoils with someone outside of your party instead of having a gunfight.</p>
<p>Any time a Raider is knocked down, a flare goes up to mark their position, though you’ll never be sure if they were in a fight with the ARC robots or ended up in a scuffle with other players.</p>

<p>Set for release in 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, ARC Raiders will be venturing into an increasingly busy genre. The extraction shooter and PvPvE multiplayer has become a popular follow on and counterpart to the battle royale over the past half decade, with the most popular examples including Escape from Tarkov and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown</a>, while there’s both big budget upcoming games like Bungie’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> and scrappier upstarts like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/ascendant-preview-how-this-80s-adaption-shooter-is-evolving-beyond-extraction/">Ascendant</a>.</p>
<p>This game has had a fair bit of time in the oven. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/arc-raiders-trailer-game-awards/">ARC Raiders was announced back in 2021</a> at The Game Awards, initially with a 2022 release target, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/09/free-to-play-shooter-arc-raiders-will-miss-2022-launch/">which it then slipped from</a>. Helmed by ex-Battlefield lead Patrick Söderlund, the team explained that they need more time to expand their take on the co-op shooter, seemingly shifting away from pure PvE originally to bake in the PvPvE elements.</p>
<p>It eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/arc-raiders-re-emerges-with-a-2025-release-target/">reemerged back during Summer Games Fest</a> with a new 2025 target launch. Between now and then, it seems likely that more tech tests and betas will be held, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">sign up for these tests on Steam</a>.</p>
