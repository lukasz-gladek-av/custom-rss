		<p>Herobeat, the studio behind Endling: Extinction is Forever, has revealed its brand new game with the title of it being Rewilders: The Lost Spring. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is an open world roguelike that also incorporates creature collection, and it is set in a time where the worldâ€™s surface is too poisonous for people to live on. Players take on the role of Abi who descends to the world to find her family, and restore the world to a more healthy state.</p>

<p>The gameplay of Rewilders: The Lost Spring will see Abi split her time between her airship above the clouds, and the poisoned surface below. The airship acts as a laboratory where Abi can unlock new abilities and upgrades to help in fights and traverse the world. The upgrades include access gliders and grappling hooks. As Abi makes progress she can rewild the world and restore the different biomes that make up the world.</p>
<p>The creature collection part of Rewilders: The Lost Spring refers to Abi finding the native creatures known as Hantu, each of which has its own abilities. Together with Abi they can restore the world and face off against the dangers that have made the poisonous world home. As you restore the world, you will have a choice to make on whether you restore the world to its former glory or choose to let it continue down a darker path.</p>

<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring does not yet have a release date but is available to wishlist on Steam.</p>
