		<p>Remedy Entertainment has detailed the Breakpoint update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a free major update that will bring systemic ovehauls, quality of life improvements, new content and more when it is released on 29th September.</p>
<p>The core of FBC: Firebreak is staying the same, as a three-player co-op FPS where you dive into missions to tamp down some paranormal threats within the Federal Bureau of Control. After a rocky launch, Remedy has gone back to the drawing board for how to get people into the game and keep them engaged.</p>


<p>The Job Board has been replaced with the Crisis Board, to present missions in a new way, while each mission has been broadened to be less predictable than before. There’s a new playable tutorial called Orientation to get people into the game, which was sorely missed at launch.</p>
<p>There’s also a new Crisis mission (which would previously have been known as a Job), set in the Research sector of the Oldest House, with three new guns, grenades and cosmetics to earn. Speaking of which, a new Gun Mod system lets you modify weapons with three mod slots.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown from Remedy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Board</strong> – The Crisis Board replaces the Job Board, presenting playable, curated, content in a new way. With this new overhaul, players can easily track the various Crises that appear at different levels around the Oldest House, offering a larger variety of fun gameplay and utilizing level content better than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Loop </strong>– Each Crisis has more variety than what came before, making FBC: Firebreak more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy at the heart of the game.</li>
<li><strong>An Improved Onboarding Experience</strong> – Remedy is making changes to the new player experience, making it easier to understand the core mechanics and to eliminate previous barriers for entry. This includes a new playable tutorial called “Orientation”, an introduction video which helps set the scene and Job overview videos, which helps players learn about each Crisis.</li>
<li><strong>New Content – Outbreak </strong>– A brand-new Crisis (formerly Job), which is set in the Research sector of the Oldest House. Firebreakers must research and contain a dangerous mold cluster, while battling new enemies. The update also adds three new guns, grenades, cosmetics and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Gun Improvements</strong> – A completely new feature in Breakpoint is the Gun Mod system. Gun Mods have modifiers that make guns more powerful or change their functionality. Each gun has three mod slots, giving you new options for customizing your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>And Much More! </strong>– Players will notice improvements from top to bottom, including the way FBC: Firebreak communicates to players, such as improved visual communication of harmful conditions to help players better understand their surroundings and what causes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this update, Remedy will be forging ahead with another update set for November, <span>which will add cross-platform voice chat, </span>and then another in March of 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">Catch the full details here</a>.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is an ambitious step into live service and multiplayer gaming for Remedy, taking the setting of the Oldest House from Control and then spinning it out into a rather quirky riff on the form of Left 4 Dead and other co-op shooters. Alas, it didn’t quite strike a chord with gamers when it launched earlier this year, despite being readily available on PS Plus and Game Pass. Teething issues at launch and more systemic complaints had Remedy looking for ways to revamp the game going forward. This is just the first step down that path, hopefully.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">Firebreak review</a>, I said, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

		<p>A major update and overhaul for the 4X strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been released, with version 2.0, dubbed the Revolutions Update, out now.</p>
<p><iframe title="v2.0 Revolutions Update | Ara: History Untold" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5xFw_o-ANs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This update is when we see the fruits of the new development partnership with Stardock, who stepped into a production role to further the game’s post-launch roadmap earlier this year. The revolutions update has been developed with key community feedback, building in a new culture and influence system, units specific to certain nations, quota crafting systems and more.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture &amp; Influence Systems – </strong>Cities gain a new quality of life category called Culture. Culture generates Influence, a new currency used to acquire cultural traits and expand territory through claims. This creates meaningful alternatives to military expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Agitator Unit – </strong>Introduced with the Revolutions technology at the end of the Renaissance, Agitators can be sent into adjacent foreign regions to stir rebellion and, through Influence, bring those territories into your nation. This unlocks a second form of conquest in Act II: ideological subversion.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Nation Units – </strong>Every civilization now commands unique historical forces, from Mongol Horse Archers to Japanese Samurai, adding tactical depth and flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Leader Redesigns – </strong>Every leader has been reimagined with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities, ensuring more replayability and personality-driven diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Priority &amp; Quota Crafting System – </strong>Micromanaged production queues are replaced with smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive AI – </strong>A more dynamic and personality-driven AI responds to player performance, making diplomacy, warfare, and resource management more challenging and believable.</li>
<li><strong>Map Generation Overhaul – </strong>Realistic natural resource clustering plus new exclusivity rules modeling historical trade and competition.</li>
<li><strong>High DPI UI &amp; Visual Update – </strong>A sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Boosts – </strong>Major engine optimizations deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We’re thrilled to introduce Culture as a gameplay element in <em>Ara: History Untold</em>,” stated Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock and Oxide. “The importance of ‘soft power’ is immense. Although military conquest is the most straightforward method for territorial expansion, we aimed to provide players with alternative strategies for asserting their influence over the world. This becomes particularly significant in the late game, when exploration and expansion have already reached their limits.”</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. Now, with Civ 7’s stumbles, there’s a chance to carve out an audience for this game through steady updates and community building. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>
