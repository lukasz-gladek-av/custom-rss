		<p>Is an Octopath game still an Octopath game if you’re not following eight different protagonists? That’s the question that Octopath 0 immediately had me asking, as it takes a thoroughly different approach to the series’ classically-framed JRPG action. Built on the foundations of mobile title Champions of the Continent, Square Enix has expanded on that game’s prequel setting and story, bringing a fully-fledged console entry to life, albeit one that does several things very differently from the previous two games.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xSyjJSAkWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, you create your own character from the ground up. There’s a decent selection of pixel art poses, hairstyles and voices, though I’d have liked to see a little more variety. There are some unique options here, though, and my favourite choice was being able to create your own favourite food. You select your preferred effect and name the dish, so I will now spend the game eating beef noodles for an attack boost whenever I’m feeling run down. The only problem with this is that I might be constantly hungry in real life.</p>


<p>Aside from that, you also select three personal belongings, each of which might give you some kind of stat boost, or present future opportunities for side quests. A letter you think was given to you by a cat? Consider me intrigued. It all serves to give your hero a little more personality and individuality than you might be expecting, and that can only be a good thing, even if I’m immediately wondering about the loss of those crafted character experiences.</p>


<p>This is the land of Orsterra, a place where legend and history prove to be closely interlinked. Here, the Flamebringer, Aelfric, brought light to the world and sealed away the dark god in the process, but now, evil is once again awakening. For you, however, things begin much more peacefully, awakening, as is so often the case, in a little village in the middle of the countryside.</p>
<p>You’re the child of the Wishvale’s Watch’s leader, son or daughter of Fried, a fearless warrior that everyone in the village looks up to. His presence clearly gives everyone a feeling of safety, and you’re soon competing to become a full member of the watch yourself. The opening couple of hours is spent getting to know the people of Wishvale, your character, and enjoying the idyllic hamlet and the vibrant festival that’s held there. It can’t last, though, and when the soldiers of the Crimson Wings arrive, setting the village ablaze, and murdering your parents, it sets you and your companions on a path into myth and legend.</p>

<p>Octopath 0 continues the series’ visual design feat of tricking your brain into thinking this was what games looked like thirty years ago. It’s clearly not what they looked like, as Octopath 0 is utterly stunning, the HD-2D imagery glistening with a sheen that would make a jeweller blush. There’s something cosy and welcoming about it, with the way lanterns burn with a subdued glow, and snow gently sparkles as it falls, and as seasonal RPGs go, Octopath 0 feels like an ideal candidate for long, wintry nights and wrapping yourself up in a cosy blanket of turn-based combat.</p>
<p>The combat isn’t as gentle as that sounds, or as easy-going as those picturesque visuals would have you believe, and the returning systems from the previous games prove as reliable and engaging as before, rewarding patience and thoughtful timing to inflict the maximum damage on your foes.</p>
<p>You build up your Burst gauge with every standard attack, and as you attack enemies, you move them ever closer to a weakened Break state. The key is biding your time, waiting until enemies are at their weakest, before using your stored-up attacks to unleash a barrage of blows at just the right moment. It felt fantastic in the first two games, and it’s just as enjoyable here.</p>

<p>That journey from a free-to-play mobile title to a full-scale console release is an interesting one. On first impressions, this looks, sounds and feels like a true Octopath title, and shorn of the mobile version’s free-to-play foibles, there’s plenty of encouraging signs that this will be just as impactful as the other entries in the series, especially for fans of classic turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>While there are no longer eight separate characters to work your way through, the number eight still plays a key role, with eight legendary rings to search for, and the ability to take a party of eight into battle – albeit split across two fronts. As we progress further into the game, it’s going to be interesting to see where else the team have worked in the number eight, and whether the overall shift in the series narrative takes away from, or adds to the winning Octopath formula.</p>

		<p>Ride 6 has been announced by Milestone, with the team aiming to get the game across the finish line and into players’ hands by February 12th. Ride 6 is adding a new Ride Fest career mode, which looks to take some inspiration from the Forza Horizon games, but players will choose from 10 real world racers to compete in the festival, including Casey Stoner, Troy Bayliss and Guy Martin.</p>
<p><iframe title="RIDE6 - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuIfwnu1SeQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ride 6 will have a large roster consisting of 340 motorcycles, though some of these will be part of DLC packages. Those bikes will cover 21 manufacturers and seven categories including Bagger and Maxi Enduro bikes. The game has been developed using Unreal Engine 5 which has allowed Milestone to add in a new dual physics system. This is split between Pro for players who want to get right into the simulation side of Ride 6, and Arcade for players who just want to ride around without having to fiddle too much with different bike parts. The Riding School will allow players to learn different parts of the game and complete challenges, and Ride 6 will also support cross platform play multiplayer. Split screen multiplayer and a race creator are not going to be available at launch for Ride 6, but will come later down the line.</p>
<p>Ride 5 was the last game in the franchise, coming in 2023, but we did not review that. However, Stefan did <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/05/ride-4-review/">review Ride 4</a>, saying, <em>“A fairly well-rounded and solid entry in Milestone’s franchise, Ride 4 makes a similarly well-rounded and solid jump to the new generation. There’s no need to compromise on resolution or performance anymore, with the PS5 able to power the game to look its very best, but it’s really the smart take on how to use the DualSense haptics and adaptive triggers that will enhance how the experience feels.”</em></p>

<p>Ride 6 will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>NCSoft and Guerrilla Games have made a huge announcement for Horizon fans with the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers, a MMORPG set in the Horizon universe. Surprisingly, Horizon Steel Frontiers has not been confirmed for PS5, but for PC and mobile only. With the reveal, NCSoft has released two videos for Horizon Steel Frontiers, the first a 10 minute long announcement which delves into what the developers want to with the game, and the second video is a look at the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Announcement Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Horizon Steel Horizons is set in an area called the Deadlands, a new location that is separate to Aloy’s own adventures which helps NCSoft keep the story separate from the events in the main Horizon games, though I would expect some influence or crossover in due time. The combat in Horizon Steel Horizons will be familiar to how it is in the Horizon games, though players will be working together on large raids to take down the most powerful of the machines. Players will be able to create and customise their own hunter to explore the Deadlands with, and there will be cross platform support between mobile and PC.</p>

<p>A release date for Horizon Steel Horizons has not yet been confirmed by either NCSoft of Guerrilla Games.</p>

		<p>Do you like Death Stranding? Do you like anime? Then you’ll be overjoyed at the announcement for Death Stranding Isolations (working title), a new animated series that is coming to Disney+ in 2027.</p>
<p>Announced by Death Stranding’s creator Hideo Kojima and the animated series director Takayuki Sano during the Disney+ Originals Preview event, their creative partnership will broaden the Death Stranding universe in some new directions. The new concept art was created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for “Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045”, with the 2D animation for the full show to be brought to life by E&amp;H production.</p>


<p>It’s the latest in a number of Death Stranding film and TV adaptations that have been greenlit by Kojima and an array of partners. There’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/the-death-stranding-movie-has-a-director/">a Death Stranding movie in the works</a> with A24 and director Michael Sarnoski, there’s also an animated movie, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-animation-film-announcement">Death Stranding Mosquito</a>, being directed by ABC Animation’s Hiroshi Miyamoto, written by Aaron Guzikowski. Now there’s this streaming series. You can’t really blame Kojima for striking as many deals and partnerships while his stock is so high, with the potential to turn this into a bustling multimedia franchise.</p>
<p>Here’s a little blurb about the story, both for the universe and this new series:</p>
<p>Once, there was an explosion…</p>

<p>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</p>
<p>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</p>
<p>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
<p>And now, comes another explosion…</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach arrived earlier this year to plenty acclaim, much like with the 2019 original. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">our review of Death Stranding 2</a>, Tuffcub said, “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>
