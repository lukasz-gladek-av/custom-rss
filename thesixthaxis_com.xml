		<p>One More Level, the development studio behind the Ghostrunner games, has released a brand new gameplay trailer for Valor Mortis. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs/">Valor Mortis is a first person soulslike</a>, and it was annouced by the development team back in August. The new gameplay trailer, which is approximately a minute long, shows the main character William, a resurrected soldier from Napoleon’s army, using melee weapons, fire, and guns to take on all sorts of horrors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis | Gameplay Trailer - The Crimson Plague" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjGtfrFmxxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis will take historical figures from Napoleon’s time and see them twisted into horrors, in a world where plague has consumed Europe but whose powers you can control. As this is a soulslike you will die over and over again in Valor Mortis, but each time you could get stronger by learning new skills and abilities, as well as working out how you need to take advantage of openings to take out the most dangerous of foes. The first playtest for Valor Mortis has concluded and that saw a culmination of 515,000 player deaths and 3 million enemy kills.</p>
<p>Valor Mortis is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>OMYOG and tinyBuild have announced that the survival FPS filled with dinosaurs, Ferocious, will be launching on December 4th for PC via Steam. Along with the release date for Ferocious, tinyBuild has created a new trailer which shows the Dino Control Device in action. This device allows you to connect with dinosaurs to issue commands, such as attacking enemies or using them as a mount.</p>
<p><iframe title="FEROCIOUS - Release Date Trailer | Dino Control Device????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0N0h-Lhf1XI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Ferocious, you find yourself washed up on an island that is ruled by dinosaurs, but you soon find you are not the only person there. A group of mercenaries and their mechs are also present and they are not happy with you being on the island, so you have to survive against the dinosaurs that call the island home as well as the mercenary group. Using the dino control device, you can have the dinosaurs attack the mercenaries and destroy their outposts, but not all dinosaurs will be on your side. There are survival and crafting elements in Ferocious too, so you can create items to help with dealing with the threats the island is littered with. The PC specs are as follows:</p>
