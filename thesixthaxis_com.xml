		<p>It’s already 2026? So that means it’s time for a new year of fresh new games, and a whole 12 months of lusting after the next big thing? Let’s get started then! One of the first big things for the year has to be Romeo Is A Dead Man, a hyper-kinetic, hyper-violent, hyper-insane new action title from the iconic Grasshopper Manufacture. This has already hopped onto a bunch of the TSA team’s radar, and this new story trailer gives you the lowdown in a typically Grasshopper-like way, which means it’s irreverent, weird and darkly funny. Go take a look!</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, I’m not too sure what the moral of this story is going to be. Don’t pick up women in the road? Don’t fall in love? Don’t let your grandfather shove technology down your eyeball that turns you into some sort of living-dead superhero? I’m not entirely sure whether SUDA51 and his team are in the habit of including morals or finger-wagging in their games, so I’m going to take it that the moral is going to be something about being faster, meaner and more violent than the bad guys, so you don’t end up being a doubly dead man. </p>
<p>Romeo Stargazer, a sheriff’s deputy, is the hero of this piece, but he doesn’t stay human for all that long by the look of things. He finds Juliet – because of course he does – in the middle of the road, and they fall in love. I’m hoping that there’s more Shakespearean asides for the English Lit fans in the back too, as the rest of the trailer opts instead to tell you about how Romeo dies at the hands of a White Devil, and how his grandfather, Professor Benjamin, saves him. Surely he should be Professor Montague? I suppose Benjamin is close enough to Benvolio. Just about.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s clear that the tone of Romeo Is A Dead Man is going to be all kinds of tongue-in-cheek and all kinds of raucous fun, as your living-dead hero takes his revenge on a series of creepy monsters.  </p>

<p>Romeo is a Dead Man releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam and Windows platforms) on February 11th, 2026.</p>
<p>You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/romeo-is-a-dead-man/9MXHH4JL4G76/0010">Xbox</a> right now!</p>

		<p>Creepy Jar’s newest survival game StarRupture has launched into Steam Early Access today, with a launch discount price of $15.99 / €15,99 / £13.59 / 51,99 zl, giving players the opportunity to survive and thrive on a hostile alien planet. Alongside the launch of StarRupture, Creepy Jar has shared a general early access roadmap of what players should expect over the next few months and further on.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQywin8d2U8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ongoing improvements players should expect in StarRupture’s Early Access include the game’s performance, the building mechanics, the combat mechanics, the game world, and the user interface. Additional features will be more wildlife, custom game mode options with adjustable difficulty, a new travel mode to go between bases, a codex, controller support, new building features, new combat mechanics, and new ways to explore the world. New content that will be added in StarRupture will include new weapons, an expanded map, more corporation levels and associated rewards, new buildings, new resources, new locations and points of interest, new story elements, and a new forgotten engine. Creepy Jar will also be looking to balance the co-op gameplay, improve the cargo network, add accessibility options such as text size and better key rebinding, and dedicated servers. When StarRupture eventually releases into version 1.0 it will get a new biome, something called frost wave, the end game content, more story elements, and achievements. There is no specific timeline for any of this yet.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Woojer Strap 4 Review – Rumble pack]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/woojer-strap-4-review-rumble-pack/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gamers are always looking for the next level. A bigger sword, a more powerful gun, magic that turns your foes into globs of pink mush. But what about levelling up your gaming setup? A headset would always be my first call, and then maybe a pro controller or high end mouse, but what then?</p>
<p>Woojer have their own ideas on that, and they’ve been toting their haptic-infused devices for several years. While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/woojer-vest-3-review/">Woojer Vest</a> – now on its fourth generation – is the headline grabber, the Woojer Strap is the more accessible option, giving gamers and music lovers an extra layer of immersion by strapping a single device to your body, its haptics shocking, rumbling and thumping in time with the action.</p>



<p>Priced at £124 – with a healthy holiday season discount down to £95 – the Woojer Strap 4 is the latest iteration of the single-unit device. In the box, you’re getting the Woojer Strap 4 central unit, an elasticated strap to wrap around your body, a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and a double-ended 3.5mm cable to physically connect your audio devices.</p>
<p>As gaming devices go, the Strap 4 is pretty straightforward. The unit itself has some weight to it and feels incredibly robust in your hand, crafted from solid plastic throughout, and available in a series of different colours. To the front, there’s a customisable LED ring with rubberised physical volume and intensity controls within it.</p>

<p>The top edge features the power button and Bluetooth pairing button, while the bottom includes a USB-C charging port and two 3.5mm audio sockets, one for input and the other as a dedicated output. I thought the older model’s copper finish looked great, but the addition of RGB allows the Strap 4 to match your gaming setup, and the extra layer of customisation gives you some individuality too. If you’re not an RGB fan? You can just turn it all off.</p>

<p>You’ll need a mobile device for the Strap 4 setup, and it proves pleasingly simple to connect the device to the Woojer app, where it takes you through pairing to your device, and then the secondary pairing of your headphones to the Strap 4. This all worked first time, which almost never happens, and you then find yourself with the main control page, which gives you an input and output display, as well as power remaining and the current latency setting, which you can alter if you find that the Strap 4’s haptic output doesn’t quite match up with whatever visuals you’re looking at.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can directly control the volume and the intensity, though there’s physical buttons for these as well, and, if needed, you can dive into the haptic sensation mode, which alters the behaviour of the haptics through Broad, Focused and Gaming settings.</p>
<p>The app also gives you decent control over the LED lights. There’s a full spectrum colour wheel to dial in the exact tone you want, adjust the brightness, and choose between a series of different effects to keep things interesting. While you’re playing, it’s not exactly something that adds all that much to the experience, but it’s certainly more futuristic, and if you’re out and about listening to music, you’ll certainly turn a few heads.</p>
<p>The Strap 4 experience is definitely easier to get into than the Woojer Vest. It’s small and portable, doesn’t take up much space, and requires minimal setup. You can just throw it on, and start watching, playing or listening to whatever you want, and I really liked how simple it felt. In turn, it immediately lifts your experience, with the added haptic feedback from your audio immersing you deeper in your content than ever before.</p>

<p>You can wear it in a variety of ways, though Woojer seem to recommend particular setups for particular input types, so for music you’d wear it around your waist, or horizontally while playing VR . Fundamentally, you can go for whatever feels best and most natural to you, and I gravitated most towards wearing it across my body, with the strap over one shoulder and the unit in the centre of my chest. This makes the haptic sensation fire directly into your chest, and explosions and heavy hits thump and rumble straight into you. Just like the rumble motors in a controller, it brings the action to life that bit further, and I find it hard to go back to playing without the extra layer it provides.</p>
<p>I loved using the Strap 4 for regular flat-screen gaming, listening to music and rewatching the most recent Star Trek movies, but VR is where it truly makes a major difference. With your senses cut off from the outside world, the rumble feels more nuanced and powerful, and whether you’re playing Beat Saber and throwing yourself directly into the music, or going for something more action-heavy like the new Deadpool VR, the Strap 4 brings a new level of immersion for a relatively low entry price.</p>
<p>While it can’t compare to the full experience you feel with the Woojer Vest, in terms of value for money, I think the Strap 4 hits the sweet spot between what it brings to your experience and the asking price. If you’ve already got a great headset, a pro controller, and a VR setup, the Strap 4 is practically a no-brainer as the next step in your gaming setup.</p>

<p>The only limitation, and this goes for all Woojer devices, is that this is a physical representation of audio output. That means your experience relies on how the audio is delivered, getting the levels right, and it will change on a game-by-game or song-by-song basis. It means there’s a certain degree of variation and inconsistency that some users might find disappointing, and hopefully Woojer can find a way to tap into the rumble and gamepad haptic signals in future. Once you’ve become accustomed to that abstraction, though, I still don’t think you’ll look back.</p>
