		<p>MercurySteam has revealed that the Blades of Fire Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC will expire in May, with the game coming to Steam on May 14th, approximately a year after the game was released for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC via Epic Games Store. Alongside the Steam release, Blades of Fire will also get its 2.0 update which will bring a number of additions and improvements to the game. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2091020/Blades_of_Fire/">Blades of Fire demo on Steam</a>, with progress carrying over to the full game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Steam and Version 2.0 Announcement Trailer [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QdCRYEeC0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Blades of Fire 2.0 update will include:</p>
<p><strong>New Contents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Plus</li>
<li>New Challenge Level: Titanium</li>
<li>New Weapon Parts &amp; Skins (only available in New Game Plus)</li>
<li>Elements Transmutation, which allows players to change material types</li>
<li>Photo Mode</li>
<li>Boss Revival Mode (a new game mode where you can replay boss fights and earn rewards)</li>
<li>Adso’s Spells on weapons for a deeper combat (rewards tied to Boss Revival Mode introducing spells that enhance weapon abilities with special effects)</li>
<li>Now you can pet the Ox in Blades of Fire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Expanded death and mutilation variations</li>
<li>Improved animation transition</li>
<li>Nvidia DLSS4 implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full key remapping for keyboard and mouse control</li>
<li>New Achievements</li>
<li>Steam Deck Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will also be an Adventurer’s pack included with the Steam version, though owners of Blades of Fire who have the game through Epic Game Store or on console will have to pay for that separately. In our Blades of Fire review, I said, <em>“Blades of Fire is a very good game, blending tough action RPG combat with a fun and unique weapon forging. The story is a little by the numbers and exploration does have a lot of back and forth, but the different regions and enemies look great and the narrative is elevated by Aran and Adso’s relationship.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/</link>
            <guid>1433380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Tarsier Studios created two exceptional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> games, but not the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">third instalment</a> in the series, which was handed to Supermassive Games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> is, quite clearly, Tarsier’s vision for Little Nightmares 3 and a darker breed of horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="REANIMAL | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bpi4lx9Lsl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares games were, true to their name, little nightmares — unsettling, occasionally grotesque, yet reminiscent of Brothers Grimm fairy tales, where children are shoved into ovens. Reanimal, despite its visual similarities, is a different beast entirely. Its atmosphere is far more oppressive, leaning heavily into visceral body horror. Deformed giants convulse and contort into scuttling crab-like creatures that snap the necks of the protagonists. Boneless corpses hang from trees, slithering down trunks and pursuing you like filthy, limp serpents.&nbsp; It is unrelentingly unsettling.</p>


<p>The game follows a brother and sister navigating a nightmarish island they once called home, attempting to rescue their friends from the twisted horrors stalking the shadows. The tone is established immediately: the brother steers a rickety boat through thick fog in search of his sister. Her lifeless body is discovered floating in the sea as distant bells toll ominously. It takes agonising moments to revive her; she splutters seawater and whispers faintly as consciousness slowly returns. It is a bleak and unforgettable opening.</p>


<p>The boat itself becomes integral to the experience, as Reanimal presents a much broader world with light open-world elements. Subtle visual and audio cues gently propel you towards the next objective, yet there are ample opportunities to wander off in search of collectables — though you are arguably more likely to stumble upon something horrific that will end your journey abruptly. This expanded scale allows Tarsier to fully embrace a more cinematic presentation. The camera pans and swoops dynamically as you traverse the island, zooming out to emphasise scale and zooming in for intimate moments. It is, paradoxically, quite beautiful for a game so saturated with decay and death.</p>
<p>Exploration is central to progression. Locked doors require keys and grotesque whale-serpents demand eyeballs, the usual necessities in such a world. Stealth and chase sequences will feel familiar to Little Nightmares veterans, and the puzzles are generally logical, with one notable exception that left me utterly flummoxed. I ultimately brute-forced my way through by attempting nearly all sixty-four possible switch combinations.</p>

<p>Comparisons with Little Nightmares are clearly inevitable, but two other titles came to mind as I wandered through this macabre landscape. Early in the game, you arrive at an abandoned town whose visual storytelling and sound design evoke the oppressive atmosphere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>. There is a constant sense that something lurks just beyond sight. It is not traditional fear that defines these moments, but suffocating dread — the lingering weight of catastrophe embedded in every building, open book, and broken shopfront.</p>
<p>The second game it brought to mind was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and not merely because of a shoreline strewn with whale carcasses. Reanimal ventures into deeply unexpected territory, both physically and psychologically. It is the first game since Kojima’s masterpiece that compelled me to set down the controller and step away, needing a moment to process what I had just experienced. Let me be absolutely clear: Reanimal is absolutely not for children, some scenes are truly disturbing.</p>
<p>Tarsier also deserves praise for crafting a horror experience that largely sidesteps genre clichés. There are no possessed dolls, no crackling televisions broadcasting cryptic images, and almost no jump scares. Instead, the game offers Lynchian body horror infused with British folk sensibilities and fragments of childhood anxieties. As kids, many of us were warned about strange men offering sweets from a van, and that horrific scenario is played out in Reanimal.</p>

<p>At roughly eight hours in length, the game feels perfectly paced — long enough to tell its story without overstaying its welcome. New gameplay elements, including light combat, are introduced gradually. The game can be played solo with an AI companion, in local co-op, or online. Having experienced both solo and local co-op modes, I can confirm that the AI partner performs admirably, illuminating dark paths when needed and responding reliably to player commands.</p>
<p data-start="4587" data-end="5046">My only minor criticism is structural familiarity. Much like Little Nightmares I and II, the game follows a largely episodic format. Each area introduces a looming antagonist glimpsed fleetingly in the background, followed by escalating encounters and chase sequences before their eventual defeat. While Reanimal introduces new mechanics like driving and scuba diving, the overarching rhythm may feel somewhat predictable to returning players.</p>

            <guid>1433377</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a fortnight after the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, developer Wildlight has laid off the majority of the studio’s employees.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to press, Wildlight confirmed the layoffs:</p>


<p><em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</em></p>
<p>Prior to this, Level Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh">Alex Graner</a> took to LinkedIn to start their search for new employment, saying, “Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.” However, it sounds like there is still content that can still be released through the coming weeks and months. Graner continued, “This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard.”</p>

<p>Tech Artist <a href="https://xcancel.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Josh Sobel</a> was also affected, taking to social media to say, “It was the best team I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve never put so much of myself into a project before.” They added, “I don’t think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment’s notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be.”</p>
<p>Highguard seemingly always had a major uphill battle to survive in a brutal gaming environment. Any kind of PvP live service shooter has to compete with the likes of Fortnite, Call of Duty, Apex Legends and beyond, and while something like Arc Raiders has shown that you can still muscle your way into finding an audience, this feels like the exception to the rule at the moment. Riot Games just launched fighting game 2XKO in January and has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/2xko-development-team-reduced-a-few-weeks-after-its-full-launch/">also almost immediately pared back the team and made layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While Wildlight had the huge opportunity of revealing the game at The Game Awards, this massively backfired for the studio. The game was featured as the final announcement of the show, reportedly as a favour from Geoff Keighley who simply liked the game and the studio (which was founded by former Respawn developers). The game was quickly branded as being a “Concord 2” and clearly had convincing to do, but then pretty much every online game gets that label a moment. Unfortunately, the gameplay reveal trailer and deep dive didn’t really manage to turn perceptions around.</p>
<p>Launching on 26th January, Highguard saw 97,000 players try the game out on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">SteamDB</a>, but within days that had dropped to around 10,000 and has now had daily peaks closer to 4,000. Obviously this is just a snapshot of the PC audience and it could be larger on console, but it’s indicative of the game’s slide. Within that time, the studio had tried to quickly react to add things like 5v5 play alongside the 3v3 from launch, and shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-just-launched-but-it-already-has-a-2026-roadmap/1100-6537653/">a 2026 roadmap</a>, but it hasn’t been enough.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we enjoyed our first look at Highguard. Dom said, “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[High on Life 2 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/high-on-life-2-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What would come next after you’ve successfully taken down the biggest drug cartel in the galaxy, saving humanity ? Well, fame for you and your talking alien guns, some degree of fortune, your sister ending up in more trouble with aliens, and plenty more stabby bounty hunting, if the opening to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> is anything to go by.</p>
<p><iframe title="High On Life 2 OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtTLjkB0vbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through the first few hours of the game, it’s clear that High on Life 2 is picking up where the first game left off in terms of style and tone. Kenny the gun doesn’t make a return, obviously, and I feel that helps to take some of the edge off the improvisational humour. If that didn’t quite gel with you from the first game, it’s toned down a touch for the second and rebalanced to make some of the excesses feel a bit more optional. That said, this is still a motormouth first person shooter where your sentient guns are constantly jabbering away, where there’s long, drawn-out skits, and a cavalcade of bizarre alien characters, places and worlds.</p>


<p>You do have a bunch of returning characters, though, including Sweezy, Gus and Knifey remaining a part of your gang at the start of the game. It means you have a bit of rapid fire, shotgun-like blasting and brutally stabby melee in your arsenal right from the off. You can also drop Sweezy’s time bubble and shoot Gus’ blade disc as special abilities, while Knifey means you can latch onto grapple points to move around the fights rapidly. It provides a good foundation for what comes next, with new guns and more movement abilities.</p>
<p>Turns out some aliens still want to make humans into drugs, and as that’s revealed to you, you end up with a bounty being put on your head, forcing you to ditch your bounty hunter armour and start from scratch as an outlaw. But you do get a new skateboard, which is pretty neat.</p>


<p>As well as being a less strenuous replacement to sprinting everywhere, the skateboard has very simple controls and adds another aspect to the already fluid traversal. There’s a lot of the world that you can now grind along, latching onto handrails, sky rails, poles, wall edges and more with Knifey and then just rumbling along them. Spot a ramp and it can be used to launch you into a double jump, while halfpipes are easy to escape by just tapping a button to jump out of them.</p>
<p>It needs to be low effort, because it also ties into the combat in High on Life 2, which still provides countless goons for you to battle through, now coming from different bounty hunter gangs catching up to you. These encounters will often lock you down for an arena-style battle, each now with rails to grind around and keep you on the move. You don’t have to skateboard if you don’t like, and there’s still a lot of momentum through a fight as you dodge, shoot, use abilities and get stabby with finishers, but grinding on a rail can help you close or grow the gap to enemies pretty rapidly.</p>

<p>You’ll find a familiar structure to the game here, now with multiple hub worlds that then lead off to the different levels as you track down the bad guys. There’s some pretty wild diversions along the way, though. Even with the first baddie you’re after, you need to find a way to first get onto his cruise ship, which means befriending a lovelorn Gatlian through a long and messy drinking montage. Once you’re on the ship? Well, then there’s a murder mystery evening for you to try and solve, interrogating the other people taking part in the game, finding clues and piecing together the story.</p>
<p>If there’s one early criticism I have of this design, it’s that I wish I just had a compass with a marker on it to give me a direction. There’s a constant battle in game design between maps, objective markers and stripping everything away, and High on Life 2 will create a sparkly path for you to follow with a tap of a button… but that line disappears a few seconds later, and its pathing can be a bit obtuse to get you back to a main route. In this case a compass or a pointer on the threat radar feels like a better solution to give you a heading without spamming the sparkles.</p>

<p>We’ve still got the bulk of the game to go, but it already feels pretty clear where this game will land for people. If you enjoyed the first game and still adore Rick and Morty’s ad-libbed humour, then this is absolutely for you. This brings plenty more of that same tone, but there’s a sprinkling of new ideas and fun diversions that could make it appeal more broadly.</p>
<p><em>We’ll keep plugging away at the game over the next couple days to deliver our final scored review. Cheerio.</em></p>
