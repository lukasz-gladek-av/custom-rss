		<p>Marking the tenth anniversary of Goat Simulator’s bizarre goat-laden shenanigans, Coffee Stain North has released a brand new update for Goat Simulator 3, the latest game in the series. This free update is now live, and entitled Gifts from the Rifts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Gifts From The Rifts  | Free Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zba_mk_4KyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s 27 new gear items added in Gifts from the Rifts for Goat Simulator 3, while there’s two new in-game events to bring April Fools silliness to the game world of San Angora.</p>
<p>There’s also a new alternate goat model: Plushie Pilgor, to tie in with a new merch collab with YouTooz. This soft toy goat has a new ability that will turn anything in its path into a plaything as well. That’s quite a feat for Coffee Stain North to have accomplished for this game!</p>

<p>Gifts from the Rifts is available now for Goat Simulator 3 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, PC, iOS and Android. It’s coming soon for the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the Goat Direct stream was filled with other Goatee stuff. There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, there’s <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s the aforementioned <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s just <a href="https://youtu.be/rTV5W0S4qoY">one more thing</a>…</p>

		<p>Rounding off the Goat Direct stream was a teaser for the next paid DLC expansion for Goat Simulator 3. Wherever will Pilgor be going next?</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Expansion 2 | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTV5W0S4qoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having launched back in 2022, Pilgor’s adventures in Goat Simulator 3 continued with the 2024 expansion, Multiverse of Nonsense, with its distinctly out-of-this-world tone. But what’s next? Well, it looks quite a lot like a vast and blank desert from the teaser trailer above, but is that then a tiger or lion growling at our tongue-dropping goat? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a teaser, and I’ve absolutely no doubt that Coffee Stain will have a bigger reveal as we inch closer to its release. But in the meantime, there’s plenty with which to celebrate the tenth anniversary of what started as a dumb meme game.</p>
<p>For Goat Simulator 3 specifically, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/goat-simulator-3-gets-a-big-new-free-update-with-gifts-from-the-rifts-and-a-plushie-goat/">a free new update, Gifts from the Rifts</a>, while iOS and Android players can finally buy and play Multiverse of Nonsense.&nbsp;There’s also <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, a <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s a <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>, which is rather cute.</p>

		<p>A release date has been scheduled for Monster Train 2, a locomotive-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC on 21st May – and if you can’t wait that long, then there’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo available on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Monster Train 2 release date trailer gives us a look at the arriving Titans, who have turned up to try and destroy the world, forcing Heaven and Hell to put their differences aside to survive the new onslaught, and push them all the way back to their home in the Abyss.</p>
<p>Building on the&nbsp;original’s three-floor battle system, you’ll have this new enemy faction to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types. Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">taking place tomorrow, 2nd April at 2PM UK time</a>, and Nintendo has now told us just how long the presentation will be.</p>
<p>It’ll be around 60 minutes, Nintendo states on social media, and you can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 02.04.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1uGRs-ispRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s basically the whole story, but you might think it mildly interesting that Nintendo didn’t choose to use a different unit of measurement. They could, for example, have said it would be 3,600 seconds, got a little bit of fractional love in by saying it would be 1/24th of the day, or gone a little more obscure to tell you that the stream will be 0.00011408% of the whole year of 2025.</p>
<p>“Interestingly”, that’s shorter than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuLci-lSeCo">the PlayStation 5 reveal stream in 2020</a>, which came in at around 70 minutes, but it is six times longer than <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-reveal-launch-date-specs-confirmed/">the PS5 Pro technical address</a>.</p>
<p>I guess saying that it’s 60 minutes is pretty clear and to the point, it just doesn’t help with word counts and search engine rankings.</p>

<p>Alright, enough messing around. There’s an hour of time to fill for the Switch 2 reveal, and plenty of ground for Nintendo to cover properly, after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> arrived back in January. It was a pretty abstract and brief look at the console hardware, showing lots of points of comparison for how the design has changed compared to the original Switch. It showed the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>However, it also hinted quite heavily at a long-rumoured mouse-like mode for the Joy-Con, and there’s a mysterious C-button on the right Joy-Con that everyone remains puzzled by. Expect those to be properly details, alongside some more technical expectations, such as if there’s 4K output and upscaling, <em>how</em> the game will handle <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/nintendo-finally-confirms-switch-2-backward-compatibility/">backward compatibility</a>, and if there’s paid Switch 2 game upgrades.</p>
<p>And once that’s out the way, it will have to be time for the games. From January,&nbsp;the real highlight was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>, and we expect to see a lot more of that during the Nintendo Direct, in addition to seeing some more first party games, and details on pricing and release date.</p>
<p>This is all leading into a string of hands-on preview events around the world through April and May, and we can’t wait to go hands on.</p>
