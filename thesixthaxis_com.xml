		<p>Wargaming has revealed Steel Hunters, their next big online multiplayer game, but instead of WW2 and Cold War tanks, boats and planes, this has got great bit forking mechs!</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game with undercurrents of hero shooters, battle royale and extraction shooter… but you’re in great big mechs that are definitely very reminiscent of Transformers and (for the cultured among us) Zoids.</p>
<p>With a full release expected next year, Wargaming are kicking off a reveal day playtest, which is available tonight from 12th until 22nd December. Join now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://steelhunters.com/">Steel Hunters website</a>.</p>

		<p>The Game Awards played host to the next game from genDesign, the studio of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ico">ICO</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-guardian">The Last Guardian</a> creator Fumito Ueda.</p>
<p><iframe title="genDESIGN Teaser for Latest Title | The Game Awards 2024 (English subtitles)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJHXe_9uhxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A game that is as yet unnamed, it seems to feature a lot of the tone and feel of Ueda’s work, though viewed through a sci-fi lens of sorts.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an ominous message to evacuate the region surrounding ground zero, and then a countdown before a cataclysmic event, there’s a rushed climb up a huge body, which leads to a giant mech head that, thankfully, manages to blast off and detach from its body before a brutal storm blows in.</p>
<p>That’s all we’ve got to go on right now, but it’s great to see that the minds behind some landmark games from the PS2 and PS3 are back to work on something equally distinctive.</p>
