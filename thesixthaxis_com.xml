		<p>Turn 10 has announced the end of active support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/forza-motorsport-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Motorsport</a>, two years after the game’s release, with no more plans to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or make regular bug fixes.</p>
<p>The game will go into a more basic support mode, so online servers will remain active, there will be special events and competitions in game, but the live service content beyond that will see Featured Tours and reward cars being recycled month-to-month. We’d expect them to tackle any critical issues with patches as well.</p>


<p>The team writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport. However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime.</p>
<p>We hope you continue racing with us on Forza Motorsport in 2026 – see you at the track!</p></blockquote>
<p>This announcement was somewhat inevitable after Microsoft chose to gut the studio earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">laying off roughly half the team</a> during a wave of layoffs across the gaming business and company as a whole. This was a result of a fairly underwhelming release for the latest Forza Motorsport, which had been years in the making and sought to bring the series up to the level of Gran Turismo and others as a longer-term racing game platform. Following the game’s release in 2023, they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/09/heres-how-forza-motorsport-car-progression-is-changing-in-march/"> overhauled car progression</a>, added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/forza-motorsport-update-adds-road-atlanta-circuit-and-multi-class-racing/">major new track and multi-class racing</a> and more, but it wasn’t enough to keep the studio secure.</p>

<p>It means that all that remains of what was a staple of the simcade racing genre will be the more arcade open world action of Forza Horizon, which is heading to Japan with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a> next year.</p>

		<p>Splitgate 2 is dead. Long live Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. This is the new iteration of Splitgate, the arena-based shooter with its trademark portals, and it’s launching today in full, leaving beta behind, arriving for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKUPFtZ4S00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded combines the best of the rewarding DNA of the original Splitgate with the innovations of Splitgate 2, delivering the ultimate Splitgate experience. The new era of Splitgate celebrates its roots, eliminating factions and abilities while re-emphasizing the kinetic arena gameplay of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded also evolves the impressive movement mechanics and immersive visual worlds that distinguished Splitgate 2, delivering momentum and polish in every match.</p>
<p>Here’s a detailed look at what’s going live:</p>
<h3>Five New Maps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hammerhead: The movement never stops as the combat unfolds in a giant rolling tank.</li>
<li>Terra 13: A large, circular map in the valley of a mountainous space colony.</li>
<li>Abyss: The subterranean Splitgate fan favorite returns.</li>
<li>Oasis: The sun, the sand, the verticality. A port of Splitgate’s desert palm-tree playground.</li>
<li>Karman Station: The very first Splitgate map, reimagined.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arena Modes, Mode Select and Multi-Queue</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and fixed loadouts–all players begin with an Assault Rifle and a Carbine, just like in the original Splitgate.</li>
<li>Added the highly requested Mode Select feature so players can fine-tune their preferred modes across Quickplay and select playlists, plus the ability to queue for multiple modes at once.</li>
<li>Added Free For All (FFA) Deathmatch, Shotty Snipers, Team SWAT, Gun Game and Team Fiesta to Quickplay mode selection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved Performance, Especially for Last-Gen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made extensive performance optimizations across the board both within Unreal Engine itself and all of the tech we have built on top of it.</li>
<li>Significantly improved frame rates, reduced hitching/stutters and minimized mid-match stalls.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rebuilt Progression System</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Career Levels dramatically deepen progression opportunities, with 75 Rookie levels and 1,000 Challenger levels beyond.</li>
<li>New ability to earn Proelium upgrade currency.</li>
<li>Added player stats, unlockable weapon cosmetics and Daily Login Rewards.</li>
<li>Read here for more on the enhanced Progression System: https://www.splitgate.com/news/diving-deep-on-progression</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Store Experience, Lower Prices and Splitcoin Refunds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced bundle prices across nearly the entire store, with nothing above $20.</li>
<li>Automatic reimbursement of price difference via Splitcoin for previously purchased Splitgate 2 bundles whose prices are now reduced.</li>
<li>Added new Proelium Exchange for players to purchase weapon cosmetics with the newly earnable Proelium upgrade currency.</li>
<li>Read here for more on all Store changes: https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-arena-reloaded-store-update</li>
</ul>
<h3>Streamlined Battle Pass w/ New Ultra Tier</h3>
<ul>
<li>Battle Pass tickets now function like XP, advancing you automatically as you play.</li>
<li>Battle Pass rewards are no longer gated by chapters, allowing players to grind at their own pace.</li>
<li>Added Ultra Pass upgrade option.</li>
<li>Read here for more on all Battle Pass changes, including the Pass Epilogue: https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-arena-reloaded-battle-pass-update</li>
</ul>
<h3>Four New Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Power Weapon – Railgun: charge it to take out multiple enemies with a single beam.</li>
<li>New Primary Weapons – Light Machine Guns (LMGs): Velocity (large-mag), Strata (four-round burst fire) and Barrage (triple barrel chaingun that shoots three at a time).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refreshed Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>New in-game music, new music for climactic phase of select modes.</li>
<li>New audio cues for enemy portal emergence, portal gunfire and in-air movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>UI &amp; Visual Overhaul</h3>
<ul>
<li>New color palette emphasizing darker tones evoking arena shooter origins.</li>
<li>New post-match flow, including a new MVP spotlight.</li>
<li>New refer-a-friend feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customization Enhancements to The Lab (Map Creator)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to swap custom materials.</li>
<li>New skybox and lighting options.</li>
<li>New color-picker tool, refreshed gamepad</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally release in June, Splitgate 2 immediately split the Splitgate fanbase, with a host of microtransactions, some of which were eye-wateringly expensive, while adding a new Battle Royale mode despite the team having previously criticising Call of Duty et al.</p>

<p>The story of Splitgate 2 is one of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The first game was an unexpected indie shooter hit, entering the exceedingly competitive multiplayer shooter arena and staking its claim to a place on the battlefield. It’s heavily Halo-inspired gunplay found a legion of fans, and so it was expected that Splitgate 2 should have been a continuation of that success. The beta period was tough though, with a mixture of unpopular changes to the game’s formula and an odd public appearance from Ian Proulx in a “Make FPS Great Again” cap, that didn’t sit well with a portion of the community.</p>
<p>It looks as though the team have done a lot of work to counter all these issues though, and we hope that they find the success they deserve with the relaunch of the game.</p>
