		<p>Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have confirmed that the twisted card game Sultan’s Game will be released on March 31st for PC via Steam. Sultan’s Game has the label of being a twisted narrative card game because you, as his advisor, have to complete different acts within a week or suffer the consquences of failure.</p>

<p><em>“Sultan’s Game&nbsp;is finally launching soon and we appreciate the overwhelming support from the community along the way,”</em> said Yin Li, Producer and Developer, Double Cross Studio. <em>“Both long-time supporters and newcomers will be able to immerse themselves in the Sultan’s turbulent world soon; stay tuned for the upcoming new information!”</em></p>
<p>Every seven days in Sultan’s Game players draw one of four card types; Carnality, Extravagance, Conquer, and Bloodshed. Carnality cards instruct players to seek pleasures of the body like sex, Extravagance instructs players to spend obscene amounts without a care, Conquer sends players on adventures to complete, and Bloodshed demands a blood sacrifice to please the Sultan. To complete these demands, players will be navigating court politics, the back alleys of the city, and wandering into brothels. Every decision made will have an impact on relationships with other people in your life from political rivals, allies, and family members. The various paths will lead to a variety of different endings, with decisions allowing you to try and control the Sultan, to outright killing him.</p>

<p>There is a demo available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/">Sultan’s Game on Steam</a> right now.</p>
