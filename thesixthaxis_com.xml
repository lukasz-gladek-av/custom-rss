		<p>A bit update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is here, with version 1.2.0 of the hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> kart racer making a few positive changes for the game’s balance and progression.</p>
<p>Key features include that the 150cc AI has been made a smidgeon less aggressive, with a common complaint being about how difficult it is to achieve a three star rating in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour races. There’s also a change for online multiplayer course selection, where traditional three-lap races will appear more frequently for players to choose – Nintendo previously reduced their prevalence because everyone was constantly choosing these over the point-to-point races that have become the open world racer’s bread and butter.</p>


<p>For completionists, there’s further good news as the Free Roam map will now indicate that you’ve gathered all of the P switches, ? panels and Peach Medallions by changing the colour of the number.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there’s a little bit of balancing here, a few bug fixes there, as Nintendo continue to finetune the game that millions are now playing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World Version 1.2.0:</p>
