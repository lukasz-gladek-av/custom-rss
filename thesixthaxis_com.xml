		<p>Herobeat, the studio behind Endling: Extinction is Forever, has revealed its brand new game with the title of it being Rewilders: The Lost Spring. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is an open world roguelike that also incorporates creature collection, and it is set in a time where the world’s surface is too poisonous for people to live on. Players take on the role of Abi who descends to the world to find her family, and restore the world to a more healthy state.</p>

<p>The gameplay of Rewilders: The Lost Spring will see Abi split her time between her airship above the clouds, and the poisoned surface below. The airship acts as a laboratory where Abi can unlock new abilities and upgrades to help in fights and traverse the world. The upgrades include access gliders and grappling hooks. As Abi makes progress she can rewild the world and restore the different biomes that make up the world.</p>
<p>The creature collection part of Rewilders: The Lost Spring refers to Abi finding the native creatures known as Hantu, each of which has its own abilities. Together with Abi they can restore the world and face off against the dangers that have made the poisonous world home. As you restore the world, you will have a choice to make on whether you restore the world to its former glory or choose to let it continue down a darker path.</p>

<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring does not yet have a release date but is available to wishlist on Steam.</p>

		<p>There’s a fresh new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, showcasing the new Z-A Battle Club with up-to four player battles. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Z-A Battle Club completely mixes up the traditional flow of Pokémon battling that you’ve known since the very first games, putting a three minute timer in place and tasking everyone with knocking out as many opposing Pokémon as possible! The trainers who strike the finishing blow will earn a point, with the defeated trainer respawning back at the edge of the arena with another one of their Pokémon ready to go, though you can still switch Pokémon for a tactical change.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to Pokémon Legends: Z-A now having real time battles where you can move around the combat arena. It also make area of effect attacks much more impactful, such as when Mega Dragonite is summoned and unleashes a meteor strike to wipe out all three opponents at once in the final ten seconds.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>&nbsp;on 16th October.</p>
