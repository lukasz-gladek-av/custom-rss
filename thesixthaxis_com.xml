		<p>Gearbox has revealed what players can expect from the Borderlands 4 endgame when it launches on 12th September for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and then 3rd October for Switch 2 – as well as what’s coming down the pipe through the post-launch roadmap.</p>
<p>Once players have wrapped up the main story of Borderlands 4 and, presumably, freed the planet Kairos from its dictatorial leadership, the endgame will have continued activities and progression through weekly challenge missions, character Specialisations, and the returning Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p>


<p>Here’s how Gearbox describes this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li>
</ul>

<p>The roadmap for the “first few months” of the game extends through Q1 2026, promising both free and paid content, the latter of which are broken out into story packs and bounty packs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Story Packs</strong> – The first of two announced “Story Packs” features the return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie in “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned.” Featuring a cosmic <a title="Genres > Horror [701 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> theme with a bloodier, darker tone, this “Story Pack” includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, all new legendary gear, and the introduction of the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li>
<li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe. These missions will reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, starting with Rush, the gregarious leader of the <a title="Games > Outbound [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outbound">Outbound</a>ers. Each Bounty Pack includes new Main Missions, a new boss, new Legendary Gear, one Player Skin, one ECHO-4 Drone Skin, one new Vehicle, and a Vault Card, allowing players to unlock 24 Cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable Gear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free for all players, seasonal mini-events will include the Halloween-y Horrors of Kairos in October, offering new Legendary Weapons, new Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Further to this, Invincible Bosses return in new high-level boss arenas built to make the most of Borderlands 4’s enhanced traversal, with a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode launching alongside each one, and there’s new Legendaries that will serve as the rewards for beating them.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4 Preview – Guns, grapples and big boss battles</a></h2>
<p>We went hands on with Borderlands 4 at Gamescom 2025, saying, “what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.”</p>

		<p>The horror shooter vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-spectrum">Project Spectrum</a> are absolutely on point as you trudge through dank, foggy, muddy woods on the approach to a decrepit manor. Strange anomalies float in midair in the courtyard, distorting and colouring the air around them, when something fast flashes across the rooftop. Yeah, probably time to set a shovel on fire, just in case.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Spectrum | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4cso5zprZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been transformed by the appearance of Embers in a region that has subsequently been quarantined in what is known as the Ember Zone. Those who exist in this region can become transformed by Emberflux, altering their bodies and minds, but you have to gather a group of Agents and then send them in to try and neutralise the threat regardless. On the surface level, this game looks like a horror-infused extraction shooter, but Vice Game Director Rich Fu explains a different path that Project Spectrum is taking:</p>


<p>“We are different from the traditional extraction shooter, we are more like a CRPG [for progression]. One thing that we might think about is that, for instance, the characters or agents that you’re recruiting [and play as] in the game, if that character dies, they might just die! We wanted to be different from the traditional extraction shooter, like Tarkov, in terms of when you are searching for materials in the game and stuff like that.”</p>


<p>Project Spectrum is not a game that you’ll play alone, though, heading in as a squad, exploring this manor and trying to defeat the supernatural monsters you’ll find within. The atmosphere that Project Spectrum conjures up here is there with the very best, with creepy off-angle lighting such that you’ll need your flashlight or lighter, music randomly playing on a gramophone, and rooms where you can practically smell the musty rotting wood from the ruined decor. You might be playing together, but that doesn’t make it feel any less creepy, especially if you choose to split up.</p>
<p>The gameplay demo we saw took us to one of three points of interest in a wider world –&nbsp;alongside the manor, a fishery and a hospital were also options –&nbsp;but the full game will have a larger map to explore. Players will be turning up rather well equipped with modern guns, tactical gear and equipment to spot and track the anomalies –&nbsp;a camera that can highlight their location through walls and scenery –&nbsp;and there’s an emphasis to approaching quietly through the gameplay we’ve seen so far. This goes right down to trying to avoid crunching across broken glass, and hastily improvising a silencer with the crafting system, though I’m not sure what use a drinks can stuffed with cloth would actually be in reality. When it’s time to go loud, crafting molotov cocktails and the aforementioned fire shovel are also options.</p>

<p>And going loud can become a very quick necessity. I’ve buried the lede somewhat, as this isn’t even just a co-op horror game, but rather has PvPvE layered in as well. Other teams of players can be hunting the same anomaly, or looking to wait and attack you while you’re distracted or wounded, and this is another big reason for the cautious and quieter approach, as well as placing trip wires and other traps to prevent getting caught from behind while investigating.</p>
<p>Human combat will have a familiar tactical battle feel of many contemporary online shooters, but fighting the Emberborne monsters will rip you straight back to the horror shooter tone. As seen in the trailer, the towering, cloaked creature, seemingly made up of many masks can quickly shift around the environment, forcing you to spin and figure out where they are again, following the refracted light trails they leave while moving so quickly. Worse than that, as you deal damage, they can crumble down into basically a giant pile of masks with spider legs that splits and skitters around – a damage opportunity for your team, but also horrifying to the arachnophobic. Finally, we see the flaming spade set alight to swing at this enemy, which definitely does not like fire one bit.</p>

<p>All through this, your character’s sanity is being tested and drained, simply by existing in this tortured, twisted region. First by the depressing effect of trudging through the rainy woods to reach the manor, then by the dark and creepy environment, and then by facing the Emberborne themselves. Low sanity can lead to very obvious negatives, hallucinating shadowy enemies that can obscure and confound your view of the game.</p>
<p>But it’s not always bad, as Rich tells us, “Let’s talk about the disadvantages first. For the sanity level and its effect, there is a term in the game that we call Emberflux, and this means that human beings are being affected by the Ember. For the debuff, you can have a lot of illusions, but once you reach a certain level you might even see the perspective from other entities…. but I cannot tell you more than that for now!</p>
<p>“Then for the advantages, we have different characters with different abilities for how they are living with the sanity level, especially when it is low. For instance, some characters might get some new abilities, or their abilities might be stronger when the sanity level is low. And for another perspective, there’s the map exploration. You will only get to see some things when your sanity level is low, which could be a shortcut, certain rooms, certain areas, views or visuals which will help you to explore.</p>
<p>“But the key idea here for us is that we want to let the players choose whether they want to maintain a high level of sanity or low. They can take some risks to experience a different style of gameplay, or they can just make it safe.”</p>
<p>With the anomaly and an opposing team defeated, you’d think that’s job done, but there’s a further layer to this PvPvE game: the Executioner. This is another Ember-infused monster, a blob with smokey tendrils that it walks on in an alien fashion, but instead of being another Emberborne, this is another player that’s on the hunt. It’s an injection of the kinds of asynchronous multiplayer horror from the likes of Dead by Daylight, or perhaps more accurately Evolve.</p>

<p>Switching to the Executioner’s view, and their power is immediately clear to see with great traversal possibilities, climbing up to rooftops, blinking to new locations, and trying to use hit and run tactics. Of course, you can still be defeated, but it’s a fun twist to have yet another wildcard like this in the game. The curious element that’s yet to truly be revealed is how you become an Executioner. Is this a distinct character that you queue up to play as? Is it a sanity-driven transformation that you can aim to unlock mid-game? Surely you won’t have any allegiances to former teammates in that case…</p>
<p>This won’t be the only style of player monster that is in the game, though. Rich told us, “For the current Executioner, it’s only one of its forms. it also has other formats, and of course, we will have other Executioners added in the future, because we really consider this asymmetric gameplay a very important part of the game, so it has to be globally anticipated, so that is why we put a lot of effort on this.”</p>
<p>Project Spectrum is a fascinating blend of genres and ideas that has echoes of Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown and more, but by injecting sanity effects and abilities, giving players the chance to be the monster for asymmetrical battles, it’s creating something new and distinctive.</p>
