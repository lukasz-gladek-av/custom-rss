		<p>A long-awaited update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2">Warhammer: Verminitde 2</a> is here, with the Versus PvP mode now available to play after a free update. Not only that, but Fatshark has announced another free DLC level pack, Verminous Dreams, will be released starting in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Versus play has been a much requested feature in the Vermintide community, given how close in style it is to Left 4 Dead, which had an excellent take on PvP play.</p>
<p>That’s roughly what has been translated to Vermintide 2, with two teams of four facing off against each other, taking turns to play as the Ubersreik Five heroes and the Pactsworn, giving players five Skaven beasts to choose from, each of which has a specific ability – you’ll know them as the special enemies that you regularly face off against in PvE.</p>
<p>There’s a new set of challenges and rewards to go alongside this, designed specifically for and earned through playing Versus, but letting you show off in other modes as well.</p>

<p>Fatshark has also revealed that a new free DLC pack, Verminous Dreams, will be added to the game. This will feature three new levels, the first of which arrives for all platforms on 9th December, with the remaining two levels coming in early 2025.</p>

<p>While it originally launched in 2018 for PC, and has now been followed by the sci-fi fuelled Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Vermintide 2 has remained a fun co-op staple. We revisited Vermintide 2 back in 2022 and had a fantastic time once again. Jim said:</p>
<p>“Overall, Vermintide 2 offers a brilliant core game bolstered by years of updates, content, and support from its developers. That kind of passion hasn’t gone unnoticed by the Warhammer community, who eagerly await what may be coming next for the series. That said, those hoping to see Vermintide 3 in the near future may have a long wait ahead of them with Fatshark currently focusing its efforts on taking their four player co-op formula to the far future in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/15/warhammer-40000-darktide-delayed-until-2022/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. The team is no doubt hoping lightning will strike twice as they leave the fantasy world behind for this grimdark sci-fi setting.”</p>

		<p>Marking the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft series, Blizzard has released remasters of the first two games – Warcraft and Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness – and a big update for the much maligned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/warcraft-3-reforged-review-blizzard/">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a> as well.</p>
<p>Each game is available individually – Warcraft: Remastered is £9, Warcraft 2: Remastered for £12.59 – or all three within the Warcraft Battle Chest for £35.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The emphasis for Warcraft and Warcraft 2 has been to bring the games a little more up to date without affecting the original games. Both games have been given a fresh lick of paint with new graphics and widescreen output, but you’re able to switch between the original graphics and remastered ones in real time – I personally think that, however they did them, the new sprites lose a lot of the original charm and look quite mobile game-y.</p>
<p>Both games also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and healthbars, a mission select screen, increased unit selection, redone mission intro screens, and more. Warcraft I in particular gains right-click move, band box selecting and a faster game speed to better match the sequels.</p>

<p>Warcraft 2 will still have multiplayer functionality, with all legacy custom maps remaining playable and compatible.</p>
<p>All of this sounds like Blizzard took on board the sweeping criticism of their last Warcraft remaster, Warcraft 3: Reforged, and they’ve also gone back to Reforged to bring a lot of community requested changes and improvements. Patch 2.0 is out now for Warcraft 3: Reforged, adding hotkey customisation, and updated ladder and more as quality of life improvements. They’ve also retouched the graphics,&nbsp;overhauling the environments, lighting and user interface… but most importantly adding uprezzed classic Warcraft 3 assets to HD and now letting you pick and choose between settings to get the classic vanilla experience or the updated one.</p>
<p>Long overdue, and what Reforged should have been in the first place, but good to see.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Warcraft universe, Blizzard has started a fresh lap of World of Warcraft, announcing the launch of new World of Warcraft: Classic realms that let you play the classic World of Warcraft: Classic without all the pesky expansions and updates that have been added to it in the last five years. Expect WoW Classic Classic Classic to launch in 2029.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The GOG Preservation Program has been revealed by CD Projekt’s DRM-free digital storefront, the company deciding to take a more active step of ensuring that classic games remain playable on modern systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOG Preservation Program - Make Games Live Forever" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IetvbdoeIhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the launch of this program, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">100 games have been handed a ticket into the Preservation Program</a>, with GOG running it through various quality tests to ensure that it runs well on modern systems. If it can pass those test, it’s stamped with a Good Old Game status on the store, and if it doesn’t, then GOG will provide active tech support to help ensure that the game will work again.</p>
<p>“We test and update the games so they work flawlessly on the most popular PC configurations – now and in the future,” they write in an FAQ. “The PC landscape is constantly evolving, with changes like new Windows updates or graphics card drivers occasionally affecting compatibility. If you encounter any issue with a game in the program, please contact our customer support so that we can verify and fix this issue for everyone. This helps us maintain the quality of those titles.”</p>
<p>GOG, which lest we forget already stands for Good Old Games, was first launched with a library of 90s and early 2000s classic, back when Windows XP was still in heavy use and Windows 7 was a new operating system on the block. Even then, with significant OS changes made in Windows Vista, such as with 64-bit CPUs, it was pretty common to need to run a game in a compatibility mode, but GOG ensured that games added would be playable on the latest OS.</p>

<p>GOG tracks what changes are made to each game in the program, even if it’s as simple as noting that they have validated stability and compatibility with Windows 10 and 11. Other changes can be more significant.</p>
<p>As GOG has grown, it’s morphed to be a more general purpose digital storefront, selling newer games, so long as they can be sold DRM-free. Those games are generally outside the purview of this programme, though that doesn’t mean there aren’t some more modern surprises that are featured.</p>
<p>So yes, there’s 90s classics like the original Fallout, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri and Riven, but there’s also Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Dragon Age: Origins, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Mad Max.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Origins is a key example of what GOG will do, with an update that has added Large Address Aware support for better memory usage, and limited the game to run on 2 CPU cores to boost performance.</p>
<p>However, they will not include community patches, beyond replicated well understood fixes –&nbsp;“The GOG Preservation Program aims to preserve the original game and make it playable on modern machines. This means being very careful with any modification that might alter the original experience. We also want to avoid passing the responsibility of maintaining the game’s quality on to the community, as it wouldn’t be fair to you.”</p>
<p>This is a great move by GOG, getting back to their roots, and highlighting game preservation and access once again. This very regularly ends up in the forefront of gaming discussion, as servers are switched off or companies seek to lock up their back catalogues,</p>

		<p>The Pokemon Trading Card Game (TCG) Pocket team has released a new update on when players should expect new content to be released for the game. Since its launch, Pokemon TCG Pocket has had some new events that have introduced new card variants and other accessories, but no new packs. This will change when new booster packs are going to be made available by the end of the year. Then in January, Pokemon TCG Pocket will get trading, however this will be limited. How that will work is not yet known. You can read the full statement below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>To all of you playing Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket,</em></p>
<p><em>This is the Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Operations Team. First off, we would like to use this opportunity to thank everyone who waited in anticipation of the release, as well as everyone who has given the game a try. We are continuing to develop and operate the game so that everyone can enjoy it even more, and we plan to hold a variety of in-game events in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>Now then, today we would like to announce new content planned to be released in a future major update. To begin with, we plan to add new booster packs by the end of the year. In addition, we are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January, 2025. We are planning to gradually expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here. We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it. We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don’t forget to open your packs each day!</em></p>
<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world. The game first launched in New Zealand, before rolling out worldwide earlier this month.</p>
