		<p>Tying in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-is-set-to-release-in-april-2026/">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Nintendo is remastering Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, launching on 2nd October. It will cost you a pretty penny to get their collection of Nintendo Wii titles, though, with the two game bundle costing $70 / £59, or being available individually for $40 / £34 apiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 blasts off October 2nd! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21HVvGkVV_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remasters promise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals for both games.</li>
<li>Assist Mode to help with your adventure, which can be turned on and off whenever you like. It lets you play with more health, heal just by standing still and return to solid ground if you fall into space.</li>
<li>An additional chapter of Rosalina’s picture book in Super Mario Galaxy, and an entirely new picture book in Super Mario Galaxy 2.</li>
<li>Listen to the soundtrack of each game from the main menu with 154 tracks in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Switch 2 support is being included for free, letting both games be played at 4K output in TV mode and 1080p on the built-in screen.</p>
<p>While it’s great to have these two games on Switch – they’re still regarded as two of the best platformers of all time – and the upgrades are nice, the price tag stings. Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel launched in 2007 and 2010 respectively, with the first getting much more love and attention with re-releases since then. In 2015 both games were released on the Wii U eShop in unenhanced form and with a discount $20 price point. A few years later, the first game was then included in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/16/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-switch/">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection for Mario’s 35th anniversary alongside Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. This time-limited collection wrapped the three games up in emulation layers to enhance visuals and UI, before being pulled from sale just six months later.</p>

<p>This duology remaster does go further than 3D All-Stars with Switch 2 support and some gameplay additions, and it does allow you to avoid double-dipping by just buying Galaxy 2, but it’s still an immediate point of controversy to have this sticker price.</p>
