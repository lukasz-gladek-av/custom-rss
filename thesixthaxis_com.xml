		<p>Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, a game that they describe as a turn-based beat ’em up coming to PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TMNT Tactical Takedown puts you in control of each of the four turtles as they take the fight to the Foot Clan in turn-based tactical battles. Each level drops your turtle into a small space with a bunch of enemies, charging you with dispatching all the foes as quickly as possible using their specific movesets to control the space and movement.</p>
<p>There’s some obvious parallels to Fights in Tight Spaces, and before that mini turn-based tactical Into the Breach as well, but those comparisons are hardly a bad thing. It just proves that this concept can work really, really well.</p>
<p>The game comes from Strange Scaffold, the developer behind I Am Your Beast, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more.</p>

<p>Studio founder Xalavier Nelson Jr. said, “Building a truly powerful licensed game requires a deep respect for the source material, love for the fans, and a willingness to challenge tentpoles of the universe to create something that both surprises and delights.</p>
<p>Bringing that kind of experience to life requires an equally powerful relationship – so I will be forever grateful to Doug Rosen and the team at Paramount for their collaboration, and putting their trust in our team to make an original take on the world that soars. I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?”</p>
<p>We’re in a rich period for TMNT fans and gamers, with the recent resurgence of the beat ’em up genre seeing the great new release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Shredder’s Revenge</a> and retro revival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">Cowabunga Collection</a>, as well as new genre spin-offs with the roguelike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>. Just avoid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review/">Wrath of the Mutants</a> – that one’s not a very good game…</p>
