		<p>Slow Game Club has opened its doors today, and it is a brand new subscription venture set up by Into Games. Unlike other subscription services, Slow Game Club is more like a book club and will provide subscribers with one new game a month, plus access to a Discord channel to discuss the games, and a video podcast where the developers of each month’s game will talk about its development.</p>

<p>Slow Game Club will have a limit on the number of memberships available, with Into Games confirming that there will only ever be a maximum of 1500 subscribers to the service. Into Games is a non-profit organisation with all the subscription fees going back into helping young people from low income backgrounds to build a career within the games industry. There are two membership types up for sale. The first is the Noir &amp; Mystery Annual sub, which will give access to the 12 games for 2025, access to the Discord, the developer podcasts, and the bonus game of The Holy Gosh Darn. This is discounted to £29.99, but the regular price is £44.99. The Noir &amp; Mystery Gift bundle includes all of the features of the annual sub, plus a Slow Game Club tote bag and Christmas card. This is currently priced at £49.99 with a regular price of £49.99.</p>
<p>All of the games that will be part of the Slow Game Club Noir &amp; Mystery package will have a RRP of £19.99 and a 70% or more review rating. All games will only be redeemable through Steam. Into Games has also stated that if a game you receive is one you already own, there will be no refunds but you are free to gift the code to someone else. The keys will always be sent on the first of the month via email, except for January’s which will be sent on the 3rd of January.</p>
