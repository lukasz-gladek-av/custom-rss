		<p>Saber Interactive has released the Heavy Ordnance update for World War Z today, bringing new perks, mutators, and premium skins for players to get. The main new asset for the Heavy Ordnance update is the introduction of perks for heavy weapons, including the flamethrower, the chainsaw, and rocket launcher. All eight heavy weapons have three unlockable perks, which include explosive bullets, napalm, and strong grip.</p>

<p>In addition to the heavy weapon perks, there are more weapon perks being added such as flechettes, loner, and shadow step. The six new mutators for challenge horde mode are as follows:</p>
<p>○ <em>Dead Pirate: Zekes stay alive for a bit of time after headshots</em><br>
<em>○ Paralytic Toxin: You slow down after taking damage in close combat</em><br>
<em>○ Ouch!: When you are grabbed, a random grenade, molotov, or masking grenade</em><br>
<em>explodes</em><br>
<em>○ Sharing is Caring: When you use a medkit, its effect applies to all team members</em><br>
<em>○ Arm Weakness: You cannot use heavy weapons during Zeke waves</em><br>
<em>○ Slot Machine (permanent mutator): Purchasable defense kits become random&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>All of this is part of the free content that the Heavy Ordnance update brings, but there are a couple of premium packs being offered too. The first is the Vibrant Halloween weapon skin pack which includes skins for the Mini-21 Scout Rifle, Paladin LMG, Keris V10 Advanced SMG, AUR Universal Bullpup Rifle, and the SchreiTech Forest Warrior Chainsaw. The second pack is the Raging Phoenix weapon skin pack, and that has skins for the Gal9 Compact SMG, ARK-103 Assault Rifle, Thumper GL Grenade Launcher, Taiga-12 Heavy Assault Shotgun and the Flamethrower. Both packs are priced at $4.99 each.</p>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launched in just under a month on 21st October, Team Ninja and Platinum Games have shared some new gameplay and talked about some key new difficulty features for the game, including an easier “Hero Mode” that adds gameplay assists.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Difficulty Design | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ccI2SOsD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hero Mode is a nice way of saying Easy Mode, and sits below the Normal difficulty. The main difference is that it adds assists like auto-dodge and auto-guard, so that new players can acclimatise themselves to the ninja action. You can fiddle with these assists at any time in the menus, and switch between Hero, Normal and Hard difficulties through a playthrough, as you need.</p>
<p>Master Ninja difficulty, however, cannot be switched to or from mid-run. This means that it will remain the preserve of the ultra skilful diehards of the franchise.</p>
<p>Thankfully you will still have access to the training mode. This, possibly taking inspiration from fighting games – will let you drop into a training room to practice your attack strings and defensive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, and it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>
