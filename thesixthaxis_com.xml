		<p>It will probably feel like you’ve got all the time in the world to play games over the next week or two, and my gaming the past seven days has been rather sparse. I’ve dabbled with a little bit of Space Marine 2 and more Darktide – a great one-two punch of big hordes and Warhammer 40K co-op – and dipped a toe back into Helldivers 2 to battle the Illuminate enemies. The definitely make for a good change of pace to the bugs and bots of old, and the new city maps are pretty neat as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played a handful of different games, with The Thaumaturge and Behemoth in for review, and there’s “the ever-present spectre” of Phasmophobia in his life these days. He also briefly gave TemTem a go –&nbsp;“The fact that Palworld is being sued by Nintendo whilst TemTem is out here untouched whilst being the clearest rip off of Pokémon is kinda silly.”</p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is on <strong>Aran’s</strong> plate for a review, which he describes as “a classic Game Boy RPG but with the adult themes turned way up.” He’s also played a bit more of Marvel Rivals with Punisher and Star Lord as his go-to characters, continued on with The Witcher 3 and is just leaving White Orchard, and some more Football Manager 2024, “where I’ve had my contract at Valencia renewed for another 3 years. Probably because I’ve consistently got them into European competitions over the last few seasons and won a couple of trophies. The league eludes me though because of Real Madrid and Barcelona.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> week has mostly featured a combination of Indiana Jones and Nine Sols – “both fantastic games with very different styles and level of challenge. It’s been nice to wander around the world of Indy in between bouts of swearing at difficult boss fights – although I do seem to be faring better in Nine Sols now that I’ve unlocked a few more abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> watched Secret Levels, which had him wanting to go back to finish off the campaign of Space Marine 2… so he did exactly that, and found it an enjoyable romp on the whole. However, most of his play time has been spent with Kingdom Come: Deliverance – “It’s a drastic change of pace compared to Space Marine 2 and one that immerses you in the life of a peasant looking to climb the ranks in medieval society. It’s a game best savoured slowly, and really isn’t for everyone. I’m hoping to roll credits ahead of the sequel’s release.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got to check out if Alien: Rogue Incursion was the Alien: Isolation VR game that everyone’s been dreaming about since 2016, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">sadly found out that it isn’t</a>. I guess we hope that Alien: Isolation 2 has VR built in, now?</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Ade</strong>. He’s been playing Lego Horizon Adventures with his son, as a nice change of pace from Minecraft, and Sea of Stars in co-op with his partner. He “me” time has been completely consumed by Unicorn Overlord, though. He recommends that you play the demo and also get hopelessly addicted to it.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

		<p>Capcom has hosted a pre-launch community update for Monster Hunter Wilds, responding to player feedback from the open beta. The update goes into the changes players can expect when Monster Hunter Wilds launches, including performance targets, weapon balancing, and equipping skills for your gear. The full community update is approximately one hour and 20 minutes long, so there is a summary after the video. Capcom has stated that things mentioned in the video could change in the future, and there are more things the developers are addressing that were not covered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Pre-Launch Community Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWqiYSA-t8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’ performance is the first topic that is touched upon in the video, particularly the Steam version. In the update, one of the big announcements is that the development team may be able to lower the recommended graphics board specs. On the console side the prioritise gameplay will be locked at 30fps while prioritising framerate will lock at 60fps. On the Xbox Series S however, it looks like the framerate will be 30fps.</p>
<p>The gameplay changes coming to Monster Hunter Wilds include making weapon hits feeling more weighty, especially when it comes to finishers and big moves. Friendly fire will also be mitigated further including for upswinging hammer attacks. The Shockproof Jewel will allow players to negate damage reactions too. Pop up camps and fast travel will be available in the full version, so you will not have to slog it all the way to a monster’s location. The rate at which monsters move between different locations will be brought in line with Monster Hunter World. In the Wilds beta, monsters were frequently moving between areas and this was a glitch that has been addressed.</p>
<p>Weapons have been adjusted for the main release as well, with Insect Glaive, Lance, Switch Axe and Sword &amp; Shield being the ones that players will notice most of the changes for. For the Insect Glaive the Vaulting Dance move will be back, increasing the power of aerial attacks. The Lance will be getting a a Charge Counter, which was previously Counter Thrust. Counter attacks can also be chosen for the Lance. The Switch Axe will be easier to use in the full release too by making it simpler to perform some of the weapon’s moves like Counter Rising Slash. For Sword and Shield the Rising Slash will be usable while guarding, and responsiveness of moves like Perfect Rush has been improved too.</p>

<p>There will be a change to how skills are equipped in Monster Hunter Wilds too. Previously, skills were only equipped to armour but in Wilds, skills will be available for weapons as well. Attack and Guard skills will be equipped to weapons, while other skills like speed eating will be for armour. Upgrading weapons will also provide the chance for skills to upgrade, more skill slots to be unlocked, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Another open beta for Monster Hunter Wilds is being considered, but it would be more for players who did not get to play it the first time, and there would likely only be a couple of additional options added. The changes that were discussed in the update would also not be likely to feature in another open beta, if one was to go ahead. Monster Hunter Wilds is set for 28th February 2025, and it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
