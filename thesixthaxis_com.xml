		<p>Bugbear has released Content Update 3 for their smashtastic racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, adding two new cars, nine new tracks and/or layouts, better AI and plenty more improvements across the Early Access game.</p>
<p>There’s also been fresh teasers of the single player campaign, modding support and more features that will be added, but for now the focus has been on fleshing out and optimising the core content of the game.</p>

<p>The two new cars are the Switchback American muscle car, and the Popper European “folk racing” car. You can race them both around the Cannonhill and Savolax tracks (in both directions), while there’s new layouts for the Scrapyard Speedbowl, Figure 8 and Main Circuit, a small oval at Speedway, and the Rallycross 1 circuit can be run in reverse.</p>
<p>More broadly, AI difficulty can now be set to novice, amateur and expert, there’s improved online multiplayer latency, support for telemetry for SimHub and generic systems, and plenty more.</p>
