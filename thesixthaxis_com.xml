		<p>Dying Light: The Beast has to be the week’s biggest release, with zombie hunter Kyle Crane returning to parkour his way across an all-new open world, while bashing in the heads of the undead in a variety of grisly ways. While there have been a few reports of instabilities in the launch build, Techland have got right on it, and immediately dropped patch 1.2. Here’s what it fixes!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsqBCs7o5go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>The team at Techland also let us know that there are going to be even more improvements made to the game over this weekend, and as soon as we have the details for that, we’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Gamoc is currently working through our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light: The Beast Review</a>, but his early impressions have been very good. He says, “It’s a return to the classic tone and style of Dying Light. This feels more like the truer sequel to Dying Light I was expecting, one that’s focused on the zombies and being terrifying instead of everything being about how humans are bad – we get enough of that in the real world these days. Dying Light: The Beast is tough and brutal whilst the suns up, and after sunset it’s just tension and terror. I’m not finished yet, but The Beast is mostly the game I wanted it to be.”</p>

		<p>Microsoft is raising the price of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles in the US, with increases of between $20 and $70 depending on the model coming into effect from 3rd October. With a $50 price increase for the main Xbox Series X, the console is set to be a staggering $150 more expensive than it was at launch in 2020.</p>
<p>The new prices are to be as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 512GB – $399.99, up from $379.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB – $449.99, up from $429.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X Digital – $599.99, up from $549.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X – $649.99, up from $599.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition –$799.99, up from $729.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing for headsets and controllers are remaining unchanged at this time, but all of these prices are being adjust upward from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">price hikes made back in May</a>.</p>
<p>In t<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">he support page</a> detailing the changes, Microsoft blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment.”</p>
<p>They continued, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.”</p>

<p>Thankfully the rest of the world is unaffected, and so it seems that the root cause of these particular price increases is the tariffs that have been implemented by the US administration. Given how wildly these have swung up and down at the whims of a capricious President – to put it mildly – and how exemptions have come in and out of effect, it’s taken around half a year for tariffs to have a directly felt effect.</p>
<p>The daft thing about all of this is that, while Microsoft relies on Chinese manufacturing and is passing the tariff prices onto its customers, it is an American company that is now at a serious price disadvantage when compared to both its main Japanese rival. Sony has had their own price increases in the last few years – also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">raising US console prices by $50 across the board in August</a> – but the standard PS5 with disc drive stands at $550, making it $100 cheaper than the Xbox Series X. Even more ridiculous is that the PS5 Pro is $749. That is $50 <em>less</em> than the 2TB Xbox Series X, but the PS5 Pro the better, more powerful console! I know the Xbox is a “special edition”, but come on.</p>
