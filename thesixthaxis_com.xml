		<p>SNK has announced that first character from Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves first season pass, Andy Bogard, will be available from June 24th. To mark the announcement of Andy Bogard’s release date, a brand new trailer has been released showing him action. He will be available to play as in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Episodes of South Town mode with his own story, along with being available in arcade mode.</p>

<p>Andy Bogard is the first character as part of the season pass, with four more characters to come later on. Those characters are Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li plus returning Fatal Fury characters Mr Big and Joe Higashi. Now to get these characters, you will have to buy the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Special Edition because the season pass is not available to buy standalone.</p>

<p>In our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review, Miguel said, <em>“Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.”</em></p>
