			<p>When it comes to early 3D gaming classics, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> is definitely up there. It may not have become as prolific a series as, say, T<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider">omb Raider</a> or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> yet it definitely had something special, so much so that fans have been pining for a new Legacy of Kain game for more than two decades.</p>

<p>To celebrate the original game’s 25th anniversary, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a> has teamed up with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/aspyr">Aspyr</a> to remaster Soul Reaver and its 2001 sequel. But is Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered the definitive way to experience these games? The short answer is yes, though the makeover isn’t as thorough as we’ve come to expect from modern remasters, and the experience is hampered by bugs and the absence of a major quality of life feature.</p>


<p>For those completely new to the series, Soul Reaver isn’t the first Legacy of Kain title. It all started a few years earlier with the release of Blood Omen, a top-down action adventure game that cast players as a noble-turned-vampire whose quest for revenge leads to a seismic upheaval within the gothic lands of Nosgoth. On the cusp of restoring balance, Kain is offered a choice: sacrifice himself to save the world, or condemn it to oblivion.</p>
<p>In Soul Reaver, the developers chose to make Blood Omen’s bad ending canon, thrusting the narrative forward several centuries. Suspecting that his chief vampire lieutenant will one day surpass him, Kain murders our hero Raziel, who is then risen by an Elder God to embark on a revenge odyssey of his own.</p>


<p>The Legacy of Kain boasts a rich narrative and setting that, at the time, seemed a strange fit for a 3D action game. The superb performances of Soul Reaver’s voice cast serves to elevate this, especially Michael Bell’s monologuing as Raziel throughout which is even more prevalent in the sequel. There’s a gothic grittiness to the presentation of these games too, spliced with themes of dark magic and decadence.</p>
<p>Aspyr’s remasters feature improved character models, textures, and effects, though the end result is surprisingly subtle. In some instances, especially when playing Soul Reaver 2, toggling between the new and original graphics (which can be done at any time with a single button press) offers a granular improvement rather than a noticeable facelift. With that said, the work done to character models is impressive and avoids masking over the charm of the original games.</p>

<p>Other enhancements include the option for modern control and camera movement. A new map and compass have also been added to the game’s UI though have a limited impact on actually helping you navigate Soul Reaver’s maze-like world. This has always been a weak point; without any real signposting, it’s easy to get lost in Nosgoth and work out where you need to head next. This isn’t helped by the fact that Raziel is returned to a hub area whenever loading a save, forcing players to trace a path back to wherever they left off. In some cases, this can mean replaying pretty large chunks of the game.</p>
<p>This is compounded by game-breaking bugs found within the remasters. On a couple of occasions I lost more than a hour’s progress to random crashes, which begs the question: why didn’t Aspyr work to improve Soul Reaver’s save and checkpoint systems? It’s an oversight made only more apparent by the fact that Blood Omen and its sequel were both released only days ago on PlayStation 5, both enhanced with quick save, quick load, and rewind features.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay it’s serviceable, though the original Soul Reaver is really showing its age. The sequel certainly holds up better with a greater emphasis on dynamic combat that transcends the original game’s basic button bashing. There are still some interesting ideas at play, however, such Raziel’s ability to switch between planes. This mechanic seamlessly morphs the world around him, exposing hidden secrets and creating new pathways.</p>
<p>For die-hard Nosgoth nerds, there’s plenty of bonus material too such as galleries for original concept art and renders, as well as full scripts for both games. There are even a clutch of “Lost Levels” but don’t get too excited – these amount to a handful of unfinished 3D environments cut from the original game.</p>

		<p>Around a year after its debut, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> is getting its biggest update yet, with a big update for the existing experience (now rebranded as LEGO Fortnite Odyssey) and a whole new social roleplaying game LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Both will be available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> client later this week on 12th December, with LEGO Fortnite now a permanent unique category for all the modes and UGC within.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Odyssey - Storm Chasers Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EMI5CLx2IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it’s up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you’ll look for Storm Dungeons to take on – these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There’s some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Brick Life Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoF7Xfp-ako?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You’ll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier – Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor – Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer – Make sure crime doesn’t pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel – Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef – Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista – Serve Brick Bay’s most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller – What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that’s in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there’s the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>
