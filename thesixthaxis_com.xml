		<p>Sales of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> did not initially seem good. In&nbsp;Square Enix’s May 2024 financial report, company president Takashi Kiryu stated that PS5 sales of <i>the game “</i>fell below expectations”, making players worried about the third and final chapter of the game.</p>
<p>Worry no longer as director Naoki Hamaguchi has spoken and said that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will be of the same standard. Speaking to Automaton he said “The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/01/30-upcoming-pc-games-for-2025/">PC</a>. I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment.”</p>


<p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely,” he adds. “A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.”</p>
<p>“For new players discovering Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 or Xbox Series X|S, I’d love for you to first enjoy that experience, and then also play the second game when it launches, while anticipating the third instalment,” he concludes.VII</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 has yet to get an official title and does not have a release date, but if it has the same sort of development length as the first two chapters, it should be out in 2027.</p>

<p>We scored the second title a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">winning 9/10</a> in our review.&nbsp; “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love,” said Nic. “It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>
