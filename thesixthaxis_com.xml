		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic and Paraglacial have announced Fatekeeper, a new first-person fantasy RPG that is set to head into PC Early Access this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatekeeper | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9xHZodgC2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fatekeeper promises reactive combat, rich progression and a handcrafted world, inviting players to visit ancient battleground, ruins and forests to uncover relics and lore to what occurred in each area, shaping your adventure and facing enemies as you go.</p>
<p>While it has a narrative path to follow, the intention is to make exploration feel rewarding. Of course, you’ll have your own character progression to shape, mastering weapons and armour, and with every encounter and choice feeding into the overarching tale.</p>
<p>Fatekeeper is in development at new studio Paraglacial, which is formed by former Grimlore Games developers who worked on SpellForce 3. Grimlore Games, of course, is currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/titan-quest-2-early-access-release-date-is-today/">just went into Early Access today</a>!</p>

		<p>Ashborne Games and THQ Nordic have announced T<span dir="auto">he Guild – Europa 1410, a medieval life sim inspired by the 2002 game Europa 1400: The Guild.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="The Guild - Europa 1410 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH4Tgtmoync?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Arriving into a bustling medieval city, you’re free to choose a profession like blacksmith, alchemist or tailr, climb the social ladder, use honourable and dishonourable means to get ahead, and shape your dynasty and legacy. Business and trade will provide the basis of many ventures, but really you’ll want to bend the city’s direction to favour your ambitions, forcing you to engage in politics, potentially using bribes and blackmail to your advantage.</p>
<p>You might choose to be a thief, growing a network of pickpockets, raiding carts and buildings, and even kidnapping people for ransom, but there will be the law to deal with if you do so. Just as if choosing to be a guardsmen, you’ll have to chase and catch criminals.</p>
<p>The Guild – Europa 1410 will come with a modern game engine and graphics layered on top of the simulation, but it’s also one that you can share with others. The game can support multiplayer sessions with up to 12 players, where you can compete, collaborate and deceive other players.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC, and is now available to wishlist on Steam.</p>
