		<p>Just the endless recycling of fashion trends from 20-odd years ago, the PSP is having something of a spiritual resurgence in 2025. We always knew that Sony’s handheld was incredibly influential – fundamentally, its feature set was folded into every mobile phone on the planet – but a console can’t exist without iconic software to go with it.</p>
<p>We’ve recently seen Sony’s one-eyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon</a> return to screens (and their spiritual successors, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/ratatan-early-access-review-rhythm-action-warfare-is-the-best-kind-of-warfare/">Ratatan</a>), and now it’s the turn of blocks that drop. Lumines was one of the most important block-dropping games of its time, standing as a Sony exclusive take on a Tetris-style experience, and now, Enhance are returning to the series with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a>, fresh from their masterful sojourn into spinning different-shaped blocks for Tetris Effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Exclusive Preview | PS5, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilo5NSlpDfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumines is a block-dropping game where timing and the passage of time are key to achieving a high score. The Timeline passes across the screen over and over again, and each time it does, it wipes, or collects all of the 2×2 blocks you’ve created by spinning and dropping the falling blocks into place. Doing this over and over again,will increase your combo, while also keeping you alive as the blocks start to stack up, and it becomes increasingly tricky to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>You can make those blocks bigger and bigger, combining 2×2 shape together, creating 3×3 blocks for an even bigger score, or chaining scores together by having them drop into place just as you clear other blocks. It’s beautifully simplistic, riffing on Tetris’ original block-dropping gameplay, and making it into something more modern and visually exciting.</p>


<p>So far, that’s all as true for the original Lumines as it is for Arise, but the team at Enhance have built on their work on Tetris Effect to maximise the audio-visual experience, while also making a few changes to the moment-to-moment gameplay. The newest addition is Burst. Entering Burst sees blocks of the opposite colour jumping to the top of the playing field, giving you further opportunity to grow a single huge Burst block, with the other coloured blocks continuing to leap out of the way as it grows. Not only will it earn you even more points, it’s a great last-ditch way to try and survive the impending doom of a full screen, adding an exciting extra wrinkle for players to iron out.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is all very Tetris Effect, which was, in turn, very much Tetris by way of Lumines. At this point, it’s practically block-dropping inception, but all you really need to know is that Enhance are masters of this genre and style, and Lumines Arise is the next step on that audio-visual pathway.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise responds to your gameplay with more feeling, more emphasis, than ever before. Blocks pulsate, breathe, or beat, while your controller throbs, rumbles and thumps in time. It makes you feel like you’re part of the musical track, rather than an observer, and for all that there are moments of frantic, abject terror at losing your streak and failing a level, this is an experiential game that needs to be played and taken part in, rather than simply spoken about.</p>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise looks spectacular. The visuals make this feel like a simple block-dropping game that’s come to life, that’s been inhabited by the very spirit of the music that accompanies it. Nothing is still; nothing is permanent, apart from your score and the frame of the gameboard. It’s a perfect juxtaposition of minimalism and maximalism, contained in one screen.</p>
<p>That would all be for nothing, if the soundtrack wasn’t good. Based on our early hands-on, this boasts the same mixture of progressive emotional dance music as Tetris Effect, and even if it’s not necessarily your genre, you can’t help but feel something while you’re playing. Soaring vocals, swelling soundscapes, all fit perfectly with the distinct thump of the drumbeat. It changes and evolves with every level and area, constantly shifting your attention, and the feel of the game, even while you’re performing the same fundamental task throughout.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how a shift in change, colour and tone can alter how the game feels. Circular pulsating shapes within the blocks feel completely different to the cold, harsh lines of straight-edged blocks, and they perform differently when they connect. One early level sees tiny astronauts appearing within the constructed block, floating off into space when the Timeline passes, and it’s hard not to be awe-struck and utterly put off at points. That will probably lessen with time, but, I have to say, I hope it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Pulling on that musical thread, once you’ve worked your way through Journey mode, you can take all of the tracks and create your own playlist. This is a perfect way to curate your own experience, and you can even watch the computer play while you just listen to the music by selecting Theater Mode.</p>

<p>There’s also multiplayer. Here you can compete side by side against other players, with Burst Mode coming in both ranked and custom flavours, while you can also fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards. This wasn’t active in our preview build, and I can’t wait to face off against some other players to see how I fare after years of playing Lumines. Probably not as well as I think I will.</p>
<p>Customisation comes in the form of your avatar, the Loomi. This diminutive floating fella is your in-game representative, and you can spend any Pon you earn while playing on customising them to make them truly unique amongst the other Loomi. It’s all random though, utilising the Loomi-Pon Rubiks-style cube to spit out a random cosmetic. If you want to get your avatar looking just right, you might have to play for a quite a while. Based on our hands-on, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is the next evolutionary step in Enhance’s journey through audio-visual gaming. Once again, it builds on a framework that’s instantly comprehensible, but layers in an evocative set of visuals alongside some of the most compelling audio design you’ll find. Is Lumines Arise already essential? We won’t have long to find out, with the game set to release for PC and PS5, with PC VR and PSVR 2 support, on 11th November.</p>

			<p>What a crazy crossover event Ball X Pit is! Who could have foreseen the rotund, spherical ball franchise matching up so well with a great big hole IP? Well, golfers, I suppose. In all seriousness, Ball X Pit is a melding of so many genres and games that the titular ball and the pit feel like the nominal components here, with solo developer Kenny Sun having crafted one of the best arcade roguelite crossovers we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL X PIT – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npSBksOTz8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re a treasure hunter, out to delve into the depths of The Pit, bracing yourself to fight off hordes of monsters on your way towards a huge boss. What does that mean in terms of gameplay? Your character fires a steady stream of balls to cause damage, projectiles bouncing around the arena like a riff on Breakout or Arkanoid, and you’re left thinking about angles, avoiding arrows and ice spears, while collecting experience gems from the fallen.</p>


<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. You can carry up to four special ball types. These range from balls that cause bleeding or inflict poison, to slow and ultra-powerful types, or ones that cause lightning to arc between enemies. As you progress, you’ll find Fusion drops alongside the experience gems, and these can do various things to your special loadout. Fission will upgrade them, by up to two levels, increasing damage or area of effect, while Fusion can happen between two, fully levelled special balls, amping them up and combining their effects into one ball.</p>
<p>Evolution is what you’re really looking for. Certain ball types can be combined through evolution into hybrids, gaining additional effects, and making your chances of success even higher. The thing is, you really have to plan ahead, and Ball X Pit isn’t necessarily the kind of game to allow you to do that.</p>


<p>There is a frantic pace to Ball X Pit, though you do have some control over that, with a speed control that’s been nabbed from an RTS. The oncoming hordes that move down the screen are insatiable, and the start of each foray into the Pit is generally balanced on a knife-edge, and it’s that which makes planning ahead difficult. You have three choices each time you level up, but you are still at the mercy of a random drop, so having specific builds in mind is all well and good, but you might have to abandon them in the heat of the moment, and hope that something good comes your way next.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a roguelite. Each run into the Pit earns your character experience, permanently levelling their stats, and gaining various other boons along the way, making it more likely that you can tackle the increasingly difficult levels as you descend further.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit throws a swift curveball into this mix, with the way it deals with your ongoing growth. Outside of the Pit, you work on building a settlement on the surface. This hub plays host to the housing for each of your characters, buildings that offer permanent upgrades that carry across all of your team, and then forests, fields and boulders that you use to accrue the resources to build and expand further.</p>

<p>This in itself is a unique addition to the formula, but then Ball X Pit messes with it some more by making it an offshoot of the ball-bouncing gameplay itself. In order to collect resources, or finish buildings, you have to bounce your characters around the town area like pinballs, hopefully completing the jobs you want, or nabbing enough of the particular resource you need.</p>
<p>There’s a really in-depth spot of tactical town planning needed here, and you can rearrange the buildings and fields to your heart’s content. So, you can make a narrow corridor of buildings that need finishing if you want, or a slew of forests at the front of the town to ensure you get plenty of wood. Equally, you can shift other buildings out of the way if they don’t have anything useful to offer at that moment, and it gives you a real shift in atmosphere and thought compared to the main game.</p>
<p>It can introduce some early frustration, though. I initially wasn’t thinking it through fully, and through repeated harvests, I didn’t manage to grab the things I needed. There’s a balance between predictability and chaos that feels quite slim, but there are ways to make things more certain by changing the layout, which I really started to appreciate as I got deeper into the game.</p>

<p>Crucially, it all fits together incredibly well. The central gameplay is exciting, and immediately rewarding, feeling like a vertical shooter as much as a Breakout-style ball bouncer. It is arcade-y and, by its nature, repetitive, but if you find that feeling of zen from a million things pinging around the screen, there are few games that can come close to Ball X Pit’s immersion.</p>
<p>The town building adds to that, with your downtime bringing you a host of things to consider, and upgrades and resources to focus on. It’s slightly retro-esque looks complete the experience well, and they’re topped off by the constant gothic rave of the soundtrack. I have to say, Ball X Pit feels like more or less a perfect game to me, building on several classic genres and ideas, while infusing them with unique and rewarding new ideas.</p>
