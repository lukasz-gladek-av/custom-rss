		<p>An internal video seen by Tom Henderson of<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"> Insider Gaming</a> is said to have shown&nbsp;Build a Rocket Boy CEO Mark Gerhard telling staff they had “caught the guys” who, he alleges, sabotaged the launch of MindsEye.</p>
<p>The meeting took place in January this year, during which Gerhard states that a “very big American company” is behind the plot, but “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>


<p>The campaign is alleged to have been run by Ritual Network, a UK based company, and they had been paying three unnamed journalists, several influencers and quite astoundingly, Build a Rocket Boy employees, all of whom worked to trash the game. Gerhard explain that they will all be served criminal complaints in person for &nbsp;“espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>
<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said. That comeback will, quite amazingly,&nbsp; include using the names of the alleged criminals in an upcoming spy mission for the game.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim.”</p>

<p>Insider Gaming spoke to <a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a> who gave this response.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</p></blockquote>
<p>MindsEye was released without any review copies being made available. It has a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37/100 on Metacritic from 14 critics </a>reviews and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/user-reviews/">2.5/10</a> from user reviews, including 457 negative reviews.&nbsp; Those alleged influencers clearly earned their alleged money.</p>
<p>I played MindsEye on PS5 two months after release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/what-we-played-battlefield-6-skycards-mindseye/">you can read my thoughts here.</a></p>
