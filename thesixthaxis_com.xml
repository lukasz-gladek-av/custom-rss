		<p>Remedy Entertainment has detailed the Breakpoint update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a free major update that will bring systemic ovehauls, quality of life improvements, new content and more when it is released on 29th September.</p>
<p>The core of FBC: Firebreak is staying the same, as a three-player co-op FPS where you dive into missions to tamp down some paranormal threats within the Federal Bureau of Control. After a rocky launch, Remedy has gone back to the drawing board for how to get people into the game and keep them engaged.</p>


<p>The Job Board has been replaced with the Crisis Board, to present missions in a new way, while each mission has been broadened to be less predictable than before. There’s a new playable tutorial called Orientation to get people into the game, which was sorely missed at launch.</p>
<p>There’s also a new Crisis mission (which would previously have been known as a Job), set in the Research sector of the Oldest House, with three new guns, grenades and cosmetics to earn. Speaking of which, a new Gun Mod system lets you modify weapons with three mod slots.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown from Remedy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Board</strong> – The Crisis Board replaces the Job Board, presenting playable, curated, content in a new way. With this new overhaul, players can easily track the various Crises that appear at different levels around the Oldest House, offering a larger variety of fun gameplay and utilizing level content better than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Loop </strong>– Each Crisis has more variety than what came before, making FBC: Firebreak more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy at the heart of the game.</li>
<li><strong>An Improved Onboarding Experience</strong> – Remedy is making changes to the new player experience, making it easier to understand the core mechanics and to eliminate previous barriers for entry. This includes a new playable tutorial called “Orientation”, an introduction video which helps set the scene and Job overview videos, which helps players learn about each Crisis.</li>
<li><strong>New Content – Outbreak </strong>– A brand-new Crisis (formerly Job), which is set in the Research sector of the Oldest House. Firebreakers must research and contain a dangerous mold cluster, while battling new enemies. The update also adds three new guns, grenades, cosmetics and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Gun Improvements</strong> – A completely new feature in Breakpoint is the Gun Mod system. Gun Mods have modifiers that make guns more powerful or change their functionality. Each gun has three mod slots, giving you new options for customizing your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>And Much More! </strong>– Players will notice improvements from top to bottom, including the way FBC: Firebreak communicates to players, such as improved visual communication of harmful conditions to help players better understand their surroundings and what causes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this update, Remedy will be forging ahead with another update set for November, <span>which will add cross-platform voice chat, </span>and then another in March of 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">Catch the full details here</a>.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is an ambitious step into live service and multiplayer gaming for Remedy, taking the setting of the Oldest House from Control and then spinning it out into a rather quirky riff on the form of Left 4 Dead and other co-op shooters. Alas, it didn’t quite strike a chord with gamers when it launched earlier this year, despite being readily available on PS Plus and Game Pass. Teething issues at launch and more systemic complaints had Remedy looking for ways to revamp the game going forward. This is just the first step down that path, hopefully.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">Firebreak review</a>, I said, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>
