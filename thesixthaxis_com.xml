		<p>With no build up or fanfare, Nintendo and Monolith Soft have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition…. edition, a paid upgrade to the game that brings technical improvements for the new generation hardware. Check out the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUGn2wulm_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrade is a fairly straightforward technical boost, now with a 60fps target through the game and 4K docked and 1080p handheld resolutions. We don’t know if Monolith has leant upon upscaling techniques or variable resolutions to get there, but this should make for a sharper looking, more responsive game in general.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can be bought all together on the Nintendo eShop or with a $5 / £4.19 upgrade for existing owners of the Switch release. A physical release will be available from April 16th.</p>
<p>One of the last Wii U cult classics to be ported to the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X arrived in March of last year. With it still fresh in Monolith’s memory, it’s understandable why they would return to this first, but fans of the series will understandably be pining for a similar Switch 2 Edition treatment to be given to Xenoblade Chronicles 2, 3 and the Definitive Edition of the Wii original. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 would probably receive the greatest benefits, as Monolith’s first effort with the Switch did have its struggles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">our review of the Switch 1 release</a>, Dom said, “With a smattering of improvements as it jumps to Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers up an epic sci-fi tale set in one of the very best open worlds.”</p>
