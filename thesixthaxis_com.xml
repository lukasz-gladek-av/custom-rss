		<p>Expression Games has shared a first look at gameplay from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, the studio’s large scale multiplayer sequel set to release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/05/hell-let-loose-review-ps-plus-ps5-xbox-series-x/">the WW2 original</a>, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam jumps to 1973 and one of the other most significant wars fought in the 20th century. Much like the original game, two teams of 50 players will fight for supremacy, but this time will be tramping through the jungles, boating up and down rivers and flying over the trees of Vietnam. You can absolutely see the game’s visuals are looking to capture the way that this war was represented in cinema, though I’d hope to see a little more variety in the time of day so it’s not always so sunset-y.</p>
<p>Fresh gameplay additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S next year, but you can check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August. I said, “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.”</p>

		<p>Embark Studios has released a new patch for ARC Raiders, with this 1.6.0 patch being quite small in comparison to previous updates. The main issue patch 1.6.0 addresses is stopping players from going out of bounds in the Stella Montis map, and various collision issues that hindered players, causing them to fall through the environment or be shot behind walls.</p>
<p>Here are the full ARC Raiders 1.6.0 patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Removed a zipline that allowed players to get out of bounds on Stella Montis.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed collision that allowed players to vault and fall through a wall in Blue Gate.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed material issues that caused multiple objects to not block bullet fire or ARC vision.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a gap in the collision on Spaceport Launch Tower that allowed players to be shot through the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embark Studios has also announced changes to its patch release schedule, and how often they will be coming. Patch releases and store rotations will be changed to Tuesdays from Thursdays, with the Cold Snap update being the first to come out on a Tuesday. That will release next week. However, the team will be taking some downtime over the Christmas and New Year period, with only critical issues being looked at during that time. Then more regular updates will resume in January.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">review of ARC Raiders</a> a few days ago. Tuffcub said, <em>“Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>
