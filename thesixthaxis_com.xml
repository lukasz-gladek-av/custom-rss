		<p>One of the early exclusive highlights of the Switch 2 era, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is getting just that little bit bigger with a new tandem DLC pack that adds DK Island and Emerald Rush to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, out now! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tkyp0u73cPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>DK Island adds… well, it adds Donkey Kong’s home island to the game, letting DK and Pauline explore the idyllic scene. That’s nice, but Emerald Rush adds a new challenge mode through the full game. Taking the chance to join the Void Crew (after the end of the game, of course) you’ll go on an emerald smashing romp through each world, having to clear as much of the green stuff as possible to unlock the mode in later stages.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re on the fence about DK Bananza, you’ll be able to download a free demo on Switch 2 and check out the deformative platforming action.</p>
<p>The game is a lot of fun. In my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, I said, “Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It’s a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world.”</p>

		<p>The Metroid Prime 4 release date has been confirmed, the game set to launch for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tSSTH0Z8_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Also revealed through this announcement was a big new gameplay feature. Samus is able to hop onto a rad looking stretchy motorbike and race across the alien landscape, not just exploring, but also battling enemies at high speed.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game back at the Switch 2 reveal event in April, saying “For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is out to kill off the PSVR 2, announcing the return of Virtual Boy games as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, debuting on 12th February 2026 for both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s the catch? Well, since these are all stereoscopic 3D games, you will need a dedicated Virtual Boy accessory in order to play, giving you split lenses for each eye. Thankfully, while there is a full-on plastic recreation of the Virtual Boy which you drop your Switch or Switch 2 console into, there is also a cardboard counterpart –&nbsp;likely similar to the VR Labo contraption from early in the last generation.</p>
<p>Mario’s Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer had their specific shout-outs, but 14 games will be dished out for the Switch Online library in due course.</p>
