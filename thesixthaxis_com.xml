		<p>EA’s latest financial report has confirmed their plans for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield</a> game. Having already started <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/">closed public playtesting</a> earlier this year, the next Battlefield will be revealed this summer. Additionally, the game is still on target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">a release in fiscal year 26</a>, which ends at the start of April 2026, meaning that it will beat GTA 6 to market – a title that EA was doing their best to avoid.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, said, “As we look to the future, we’re confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline — beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment.”</p>


<p>In following statements during a Q&amp;A with investors, Wilson added “Relative to Battlefield, what we have said all along is we’ve been building towards a window that we thought made the most sense for Battlefield, but we wouldn’t launch into a window that we thought truncated the value that we’ve invested into the franchise, or the value that we think our players will derive from it once they jump in and start playing.</p>
<p>“I think now, without going too far, we believe that window is clearer than it was before and we feel very good about launching Battlefield in [financial year] 2026.”</p>
<p>He is, of course, referring to GTA 6 having vacated this fiscal year. Take-Two had repeatedly stated that GTA 6 was on target for a release before the end of 2025, but has now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">pushed GTA 6’s launch back by around half a year with a 26th May 2026 release date</a>. EA have always stated that the next Battlefield is aiming for a FY26 release, giving them flexibility to avoid GTA 6 if it had launched this year. It’s likely that EA were targeting the end of 2025 to try and snatch the Christmas spending rush, but with leeway to fall back to the following year if it was advantageous, or they could have always had early 2026 in the crosshairs.</p>

<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>
