		<p>Microsoft’s cross-platform push is bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-releases-this-fall/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/age-of-mythology-retold-has-been-revealed/">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold will launch for PS5 on 4th March with Age of Empires II: DE coming to Sony’s console later this spring.</p>


<p>Launching at the exact same time as the PS5 port is the Immortal Pillars expansion for Age of Mythology: Retold. This delves into Chinese culture and mythology for its inspiration, featuring 12 new gods, such as Fuxi, Shennong, Nüwa, Gonggong and Zhurong, a 9-level campaign, new mythical units and 7 new maps.</p>
<p>Immortal Pillars is bundled into Age of Mythology: Retold Premium Edition, which also grants 5 days early access to the game on PS5 from 27th February.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty special time to be a fan of Age of Empires series, with Microsoft having greenlit remasters/remakes of the whole classic RTS series, as well as bringing out Age of Empires 4 as a brand new entry. But they haven’t stopped there. Instead of treating each game’s remaster as a final, definitive edition, they have (regardless of the name) also brought new expansions, new campaigns and factions to the table. There’s also multiple expansions coming to Age of Empires 4 later this year.</p>

<p>A lot of this has been done with Microsoft’s World’s Edge team working closely with the fan-founded team at Forgotten Empires. Immortal Pillars also has Virtuos Games and Tantalus Media as developers.</p>
<p>It’s not always gone perfectly to plan, though. With so many Age of Empires games now being viewed as current projects, all deserving of attention and expansions, the teams have been stretched a bit too thin, and the audience spread across too many games. Because of this, it was recently <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-dlc-news/">announced that further Age of Empires 3 DLC has been cancelled</a>, and that it had been announced too soon before work had begun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-5-1-adds-dlss-4-and-better-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Star Wars Outlaws patch 1.5.1 has been released, fixing a couple of bugs and introducing the latest versions of DLSS and PSSR upscaling.</p>
<p>On PC, DLSS 4 has been added to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, supporting multi frame generation for the GeForce RTX 50 series, but also bringing a new transformer model to the table for all generations of RTX cards, improving the quality of the machine learning upscaling effort. Additionally, this transformer model also affects DLSS Ray Reconstruction to improve the fidelity of ray tracing in general, and can be used for super resolution and DLAA for anti-aliasing.</p>


<p>Over on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, Star Wars Outlaws now supports a newer version of PSSR upscaling, hoping to address complaints about the image quality from around the PS5 Pro’s launch. While it was expected to be possible, this is the first time that we’ve publicly heard about Sony being able to upgrade the PSSR upscaling model on PS5 Pro, so this is definitely very interesting and could see improvements rolled out to other games, though it will likely require game updates as opposed to having Sony unilaterally update the model across the whole system.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.5.1:</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws on PC now features DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 series, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame. DLSS 4 also introduces faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage for RTX 50 and 40 Series, and new transformer AI models for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX GPUs, which enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion.</em></p>

<p><strong>Streaming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crashing issue on streaming platforms when travelling to Renpalli Station</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA series 5 GPUs</li>
</ul>
<p>PS5:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSSR has been updated to the latest version for PS5 Pro users</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All platforms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Kay could not dismount the speeder when on a steep incline</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where audio from overhead ships would be louder than expected</li>
</ul>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>
