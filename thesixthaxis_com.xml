		<p>Warner Bros. is holding up the cartoon white flag and saying “That’s all Folks!” to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, with support for the character-filled brawler coming to an end after Season 5 on 30th May 2025. On that date, the game will be removed from online stores and servers will be shut down, but it will still be playable offline.</p>
<p>All online features will run up until 30th May at 9AM PST (5PM UK time), after which point the game will be playable offline only, with solo AI battles or couch multiplayer with up to four players.</p>


<p>In order to keep the game accessible, you must play and log in at some time during Season 5 – from 4th February to 30th May – which will create the necessary save file and online account links to allow you to play offline with all earned and purchased content.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the game’s shutdown, real money purchases have been taken down from today. You can no longer purchase Gleamium, though it and character tokens can be used through to the server shutdown.</p>

<p>The MultiVersus team at Player First Games wrote a little thank you at the end of the announcement:</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey.​</p>
<p>&nbsp;​We hope that you all enjoy the final Season of MultiVersus.</p>
<p>MultiVersus burst onto the scene in 2022, offering a Super Smash Bros. contender filled with characters drawn from across the Warner Bros. media empire. However, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">after an initial surge of popularity for the open beta</a>, the rapidly growing community started to highlight gameplay deficiencies and developer Player First Games struggled to keep up, while also producing all the regular content that a free-to-play live service needs.</p>
<p>So the game was pulled from storefronts, instead of trying to roll through to a full release, and only reappeared last year.&nbsp;While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. admitted in financial reports that MultiVersus’ revival had underperformed expectations, so alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">the end of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping Player First Games get the opportunity to craft something new and fun.</p>
