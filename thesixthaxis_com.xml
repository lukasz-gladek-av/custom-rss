		<p>Focus Entertainment has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-3">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a> development has begun, which is great news for fans of one of the biggest hits of 2024.</p>
<p>“Your duty is not done,” the company writes on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/focus-entmt.com/post/3lkbkal3ils2k">BlueSky</a>. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun at Focus Entertainment, Saber Interactive and Games Workshop.”</p>


<p>“Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games,” they add. “We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment.”</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how Focus frames the game’s development as being a collaboration between the three companies. This comes a few weeks after it was announced quite specifically that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-tentpole-aaa-game/">Hasbro has signed the Space Marine 2 team</a> to develop one of their tentpole franchises into a game. There’s a lot of flexibility in how studios work these days, so Saber’s St. Petersburg studio could have multiple teams and new creative leads could be stepping up to work on Space Marine 3 while the old leads look to crack this new nut.</p>
<p>Either way, it will be a while before we actually get to see Space Marine 3, and if you were worried that Space Marine 2 would be dropped like an unloved toy from yesteryear, Focus have assured players that there is still plenty of support for that game to come, continuing on with the planned post-launch support roadmap.</p>

<p>They followed up, “We’ll share updates on this new title when the time is right. For now, our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for Space Marine 2 players.”</p>
<p>There’s already been the dangled thread&nbsp;that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. Back in February, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/">on the cusp of Season 3 of content, the team said</a>, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to start speculating what kind of challenge you’ll have to face when Space Marine 3 arrives. After battling Orks and Chaos in the first, Relic Entertainment developed game, Saber used their Swarm engine to great effect to let you fight Tyranids… and also Chaos – which the developers admitted was something they wished they hadn’t repeated. However, there were also teasers of other alien races sprinkled through Space Marine 2, with the appearance of Necron tombs hinting that these ancient robotic beings could be opponents in future…. and hopefully not Chaos again.</p>
<p>Even with that foible, Space Marine 2 goes down a treat for fans of Warhammer 40,000 in particular. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has unwrapped Rainbow Six Siege X, their big overhaul for the decade-old tactical shooter, aiming to prepare the game for the decade to come. Rainbow Six Siege X will launch on 10th June 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Reveal Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0Hw96M5bC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As part of that there’s a whole host of technical improvements and updates to the core game, but perhaps the biggest announcement here is that the game is going free-to-play with free access to the bulk of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> experience – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">including the new Dual Front mode</a> – while a paid tier (or a prior purchase) locks away certain modes and operators.</p>
<p>There’s a significant visual overhaul, with Ubisoft going back to rework all of the main materials within the game, upping the detail for things as fundamental as brick walls and wooden planks. Alongside that, there’s refreshed lighting and reflections that are best seen in the maps Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Russian Cafe, and Border. The change can feel very subtle without side-by-side comparisons, but the emphasis is basically on making lighting more realistic, so rooms will likely be a notch darker and light sources, like the sun streaming through windows in Bank, more important. Three more maps will be modernised in the same way with every season going forward, and a new map will be added each season from Year 11.</p>

<p>Maps will also feature new destructible ingredients that can be used tactically. Fire extinguishers can create a temporary smoke screen or even concuss anyone caught in their blast. Gas pipes will cut off an area with a flame that gradually concentrates before exploding to set an area on fire for a little while, and metal detectors are now interactive, and can be disabled temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Audio has been given the 2.0 treatment with better sound propagation and better reverb to make it easier to tell where things are coming from. Sound now passes through walls, instead of just bouncing around the environments, and sounds in a small room will have a different reverb to those in a large room or coming from the exterior.</p>
<p>Oh, and they returned to the motion capture studio to dramatically improve rappelling. You can now rappel round corners, and you can sprint along walls for faster repositioning – though obviously they’ll hear you stomping on the walls from the inside.</p>

<p>Along with all of this there’s to be an overhauled esports section in the menu UI, and Pick and Ban has been rejigged to make it quicker – both teams will choose at the same time, and then get a chance to amend picks and bans when swapping between attack and defence. For prospective newcomers there’s a redone onboarding progression and, most significantly, a shift to free access to the game – ranked, esports and access to the full character roster will require that you pay or have already paid. There’s new tutorials and a Clearance Levels onboarding system that aims to get new players up to speed, first against bots, then other players in Quick Match, before Unranked returns as the standard playlist and feeds into Ranked.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X isn’t a full sequel, but it’s still an important step for the game. There’s the excitement and intrigue that a new game mode inevitably brings, sensible improvements throughout, and making the game free to play and with a new introduction to the game can bring this to a wider audience once more.</p>
