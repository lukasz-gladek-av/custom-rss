		<p>Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has given a new interview and explained that Xbox exclusives are a thing of the past as they no longer make financial sense. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1883243143342231655">Destin Legarie</a> asked Phil if Starfield, one of 2023’s big Xbox exclusive games would be “staying put” and after a few moments Phil replied with a firm “No.”</p>
<p>“There’s no specific game… this kinda goes back to my red line answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place, where it would find players, where we would have business success for us.” He then adds “To keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us.”</p>


<p>The statements come almost exactly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">a year after Microsoft’s presentation i</a>n which they announced the first four games that would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo, during which they specifically stated Starfield was not coming to other consoles, so a lot has changed in the last year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> Rumours suggest</a> Flight Simulator, Hellblade 2, and the Halo Collection will be coming to PlayStation sometime this year.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>&nbsp;will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo">&nbsp;adds</a>&nbsp;“I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>
