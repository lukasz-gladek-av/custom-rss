		<p>Concluding their 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents stream, The Pokémon Company revealed the next generation of mainline Pokémon game: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. The traditional game duo will be coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B15Ydgm6QtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot to unpick from the trailer, including the introduction of two new Pikachus, turning up like your parents coming back from a holiday to Barbados or something, decked out in holiday clothing. Their official names? Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu. It then rolls into the boy and girl protagonists for the new adventure, the boy in a stetson and girl in a blue baseball cap as they set out into the lush and vibrant wilderness. The outfits you get will be determined by the version of the game you buy.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb about the world:</p>
<p><em>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</em></p>

<p>One thing that really stands out from all of this is the weather and wave effects. It’s clearly very windy at times, blowing the clouds through the sky, while the rolling seas look incredible – not far off the wave effects seen in the likes of Sea of Thieves and Skull and Bones. There’s also the suggestion that we’ll be able to go underwater and check out the marine life below the surface.</p>
<p>The trailer introduces us to the three starter Pokémon for this new generation of game, in the traditional fire, grass and water types.</p>
<p>Meet Browt, the leafy owl-like Pokémon.</p>

<p>Pombon is a firey pomeranian-looking dog Pokémon</p>

<p>And Gecqua is… well, they’re a water gecko,</p>

<p>It will be a good long wait for this game to launch, likely targeting a holiday 2027 launch, which makes the Switch 2 exclusivity make much more sense. At least there’s plenty of other Pokémon games to keep you entertained until then. Marking the 30th anniversary, there’s a fresh Switch and Switch 2 release for the Game Boy Advance remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-are-coming-to-the-switch-next-week/">Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green today</a>. There’s also the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> next week, for more of a cosy gaming aesthetic.</p>
