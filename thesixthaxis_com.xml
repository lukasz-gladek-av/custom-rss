		<p>Almost a decade after the game’s original release, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a> has been patched on modern consoles with a significant performance update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin’s Creed Syndicate TV spot Trailer [EUROPE]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT5Ws-RDUI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has confirmed that the underrated, Victorian era stealth ’em up now runs at a silky smooth 60 frame per second on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There’s also the option to simultaneously crank the game’s resolution to 4K though this won’t be available to those playing on the slightly less robust Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>The publisher didn’t give a specific reason for Syndicate’s mini makeover, nor has it hinted at similar updates for other popular AC titles including the Ezio Collection, Unity, and Black Flag. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">With Assassins’ Creed Shadows pushed back to February 2025,</a> it likely wanted to drum up interest in older entries with many players having overlooked Syndicate.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate launched in October 2015 and although it was met with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review/">generally positive reviews</a>, fans had become overfamiliar with the franchise’s time-hopping, open world formula even if introduced dual protagonists and a genuinely interesting setting. This would be the final instalment before Ubisoft hit the reset button, transporting players back to Ancient Egypt in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed: Origins. Its debut drew a line in the sand and would serve as the foundation for future titles, treading further and further into action RPG territory.</p>

<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage went against the grain with a smaller, more focused adventure that dialled back many of those roleplaying systems. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">our review</a> we scored it a fair 7/10, Aran saying: “Assassin’s Creed Mirage will appeal to anyone who’s been pining for a return to the old school open world stealth of the earlier games. It’s pretty much exactly that with a few extra refinements and additions. Some of those additions are a bit distracting and immersion breaking, but nothing gets in the way of some good old fashioned assassinations.”</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has announced that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> demo will be available to download on November 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>The free demo will give players their first taste of the reimagined hack and slash series as they take on the role of nameless warrior whose fate in entwined with that of ancient China’s warring Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set during a campaign against the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, players will find themselves thrust into the Battle of Sishui Gate. For those who have been following Dynasty Warriors: Origins since its announcement, this is the same stage that has been shown off during various expos, showcasing many of the game fresh new features as well as some of its most beloved characters. Speaking of which, the Battle of Sishui Gate is where the allied Three Kingdoms first face off against the legendary warrior, Lu Bu, a fight that’s bound to put players through their paces once the training wheels come off.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will officially launch next year on January 17th, making it one of 2025’s first major releases with pre-orders now live across all available platforms. It’s a soft reset for the series, and while it doesn’t look to be a complete departure from previous games there are some interesting mechanics at play that will hopefully dispel the bad taste left by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-9">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>.</p>

<p>It has been the best part of a decade since the last numbered instalment which scored a mediocre 5/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 review</a>. We concluded that” Sadly, this isn’t the breakthrough fans were expecting. Omega Force took a pretty big risk with Dynasty Warriors 9, and while its open world integration can be seen as a small triumph, this newest entry is marred by its heavily outdated approach to combat design.”</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to attend a preview event for Origins and will have some first hands-on impressions coming very soon.</p>
