			<p>Way back when it was announced, Playtonic’s Yooka-Laylee attracted a huge amount of excitement and anticipation, promising to bring back the lost art of the collectathon 3D platformer. With ex-Rare devs leading the way, and their former employer subject to the whims of Microsoft’s inner workings, fans were hoping that the lizard and bat combination would resurrect the golden age of Banjo-Kazooie et al. The end result was one of the biggest disappointments in gaming memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Yooka-Laylee</a> wasn’t a complete disaster but felt unfinished and strangely empty, especially in the later levels. The 2D spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Impossible Lair</a> was far more complete and therefore better received but it was clear that Playtonic felt that there was unfinished business with the first game. Enter Yooka-Replaylee.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spXZHz4ZXUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is the updated and fully fleshed out version of the original pitch that fans were excited for back in the day. The visuals have had a major overhaul, the levels filled with new challenges, and the game mechanics given a new lease of life. It’s no exaggeration to say that this is the definitive Yooka-Laylee experience and I hope that it reaches the wider audience that it deserves.</p>


<p>The visual upgrade is the first thing to hit you upon starting up the game. I played on Switch 2, predominantly handheld, and the new palette really pops on the screen. It also looked fantastic when docked with smooth performance and a much improved camera. The different levels really stand out with the increased graphical detail, leading to environments that are far more interesting to explore. Exploration is also required as there are double the number of pagies to collect and many new minigames and trials to complete.</p>


<p>Just in case you are new to the series, let’s go through some background. Yooka and Laylee are best friends that live on a pirate ship. One is a lizard and one is a bat, with the latter living on Yooka’s back in much the same way that Kazooie lived in Banjo’s backpack. They have the same kind of friendly banter and back-and-forths, and share many of the same platforming skills of their spiritual predecessors. Whilst relaxing on their ship one day, they meet a magical book that offers power to its owner. Before they can get too comfortable, though, the evil Capital B steals the book and scatters its pages throughout the lands. It is therefore up to the dynamic duo to explore the various levels and rescue the Pagies.</p>
<p>The original game had a system of unlocks that meant you had to buy skills as you progressed and return to levels to find Pagies that were unavailable first time around. One of the most transformative changes in the new version is that all of the skills are at your disposal from the very start. This makes it possible to completely clear a level before moving on if you want to go for 100% and removes the need to backtrack. This doesn’t mean that completion is easy, though, as there are still some fiendishly hidden collectables and challenging minigames to beat in order to collect everything.</p>

<p>You begin your quest to collect the Pagies in the overworld hub. This area contains the entrances for the five levels, each with 50 Pagies to collect, as well as 50 Pagies of its own. Accessing each level requires you to have a set amount of Pagies, but this amount has not been altered from the original, so it is actually possible to reach the final confrontation with Capital B after rinsing just the first two levels and the overworld to meet its 120 Pagies goal. This is a peculiar choice as it makes much of the new content feel far more optional than it should. There isn’t even an achievement for collecting every Pagie, which seems like a bizarre choice. I only briefly touched the last two levels in my playthrough, but know I will be returning to mop up the rest of the collectables at some point.</p>
<p>It’s not just Pagies, as there are also 150 Quills, currency that you can use to buy upgrades from Trowser the Snake, 5 Ghosts with different approaches to collect them, hidden pig characters to find, an Arcade coin for Rex’s retro arcade machine, a Mollycule for Dr Puzz, coins to spend with Vendi the Vending Machine, 8 Pagie fragments, and even more. The collectathon is the game here, with narrative being restricted to entertaining cutscenes as you unlock each Pagie door – another clear influence from Banjo-Kazooie.</p>

<p>Each level is well designed to hide all of these many collectables and you’ll need to scour every nook and cranny to find them all, as well as fully exploit Yooka and Laylee’s abilities to traverse complex platforming sections with impressive verticality. Enemies are frequent with different varieties for each biome and there are fun boss battles that reward victory with 3 Pagies. Less fun are the returning mine cart sections that remain just as frustrating as ever. Fortunately the huge excess of Pagies in this version means that you can ignore challenges or minigames that you don’t want to play. Perhaps the most radical redesign here is the Retro Rex Arcade minigame which now plays out with far more substance than originally.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Yooka-Replaylee isn’t just the definitive version of the game; it’s one of the most enjoyable 3D platformers this side of Nintendo first party titles or Astro Bot. The levels are now packed with things to do, the range of different challenges keeps things interesting, and the upgrades and equippable tonics enable you to customise the difficult to suit your playstyle. All in all, this is now an essential purchase for fans of 3D platformers.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I have to say, the Switch 2 might be my favourite console. I liked the original Switch well enough, but the bump in power is really helping to make it feel like, well, an actual console, rather than a handheld masquerading as one. The whole handheld that turns into a home console is an alluring one, which is probably why rumours that Sony are eying up the same format for the next generation are so interesting. The number one thing that holds these things back, though, is battery life. I can just about live with the Switch 2, but both the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally are woeful on the battery front when I’m trying to play the games I want to play.</p>
<p>It has been a busy week wherever I’ve been playing, and I’ve spent a good deal of time with Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. It’s a great pairing of Fire Emblem-esque strategy and roguelike progression, and I definitely recommend you check it out! Besides that, I’ve spent ages building parks in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/jurassic-world-evolution-3-review/">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> and then gone round and round a lot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/">NASCAR 25</a>, both of which have kept me very happy indeed.</p>

<p>The first to drop into WWP this week was <strong>Laura</strong>, and she responded to my shouted call for WWP by shouting right back at me, yelling “I’VE STARTED PLAYING JURASSIC WORLD EVOLUTION 3 AND GOODNESS ME THOSE DINOSAURS HAVE HAD A LEVEL UP IN GRAPHICS IN THIS LATEST ONE. ALSO, BABY DINOSAURS! SQUEEE! PS EVERYTHING SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN CAPS ON A FRIDAY!” That feels very loud for a Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> was next in, showing great restraint to calmly inform us that he’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/fading-serenades-review/">Fading Serenades</a>, Once Upon A Jester, and Slots &amp; Daggers for review – see those two later today.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been kicking around in Lumoise and Iwatodai, jumping between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/persona-3-reload-switch-2-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>. He’s got plans for the future though, saying, “I’m looking forward to starting Ghost of Yotei when my wife and I are free at the same time, as she wants to watch me play this one!”</p>

<p>Having just finished up Yooka-Replaylee, <strong>Steve</strong> told us, “It is the game it was always meant to be and a must play for 3D platformer fans.” He continued, “I’ve also been continuing to explore indie demos on Steam, with a focus on horror for this spooky season. I’ve got Powerwash Simulator 2 installed for my new comfort game, ready for the dark and cold nights.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has been playing Super Fantasy Kingdom, which he says is “yet another deeply compelling Hooded Horse game. I don’t know how they keep doing it.” He’s also been playing Pokemon Legends Z-A, but decries, “I’m enjoying it, but really wish it was better.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga, but hasn’t really been enjoying it. He says, “Sadly, it isn’t very good. It looks fantastic, but the gameplay is tedious filler and most of the stuff that made the original so compelling has been lost. Despite its short length, I’m not sure I’m going to make it to the end credits on this one, I’ll probably go play Hades 2 again instead!” He’s not forced his child to play either of these things though, with his son having really got into Marvel Rivals. Ade said, “His go to characters currently being Spidey, Venom, and Namor. Makes a nice change from all things Minecraft for Dad!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> has briefly shelved Ghost of Yotei this week in order to play some Battlefield 6. He told us, “Much like every Call of Duty entry, I find myself sworn to beat the Battlefield campaigns before I touch the multiplayer which hasn’t been entirely disastrous this time around. The BF6 campaign has some flashy locations and cool set pieces but the story didn’t really land with me.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has played a bit of Battlefield 6 multiplayer this week, made a start on Escape Simulator 2 with his better half, and did his best in an extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

		<p>Developer emptyvessel has released an extended gameplay video of its upcoming 4v4v4v4 cyberpunk first person shooter DEFECT. In the game, you choose to play as a member of one of a number of factions including The System’s Police Force, Rogue Police, or a member of different gangs as each group attempts to complete its own objectives while sabotaging and defeating the others.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Extended Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0d9sqm5LX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this extended gameplay trailer for DEFECT, we open with the load in screen for The System’s police force where players vote on the objective to pursue and prepare their loadouts for the starting phase, though you can pick up and find other weapons in the matches too. The police’s mission here is to infiltrate Nodrog’s territory, whose voice can be heard taunting the force. During the footage you see switches to surveillance camera views, and this is how Nodrog is following the police’s moves. These cameras can be hacked to provide additional tactical advantages.</p>
<p>Players will have a variety of tools at their disposal like drones and scanners to scout out areas, and a tool called a Body Snatch. With Body Snatch, players can subdue enemies and then transfer a downed teammate’s consciousness into that body. In the video, we see this play out with a gang member being taken down and then joining the police due to their mind being taken over. There are also health stations dotted around maps, but they only have three charges and are usually in dangerous areas. Health does not regenerate so finding and defending these points is also a crucial element of matches in DEFECT. The final objective in this video is to reboot the building’s operating system, but emptyvessel has stated final objectives differ and can change depending on what is happening in matches.</p>

<p>This video just looks at DEFECT’s multiplayer PvP mode, though emptyvessel has confirmed it is also working on single player and co-op content for the game. A release date is yet to be confirmed for the game, with PC currently confirmed as the only platform with Steam Deck compatibility in the works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s something about handheld gaming that just seems to fit with tactical games. Nintendo in particular, have regularly married the two, with series like Fire Emblem forming part of the bedrock of their handheld gaming lineup for many years. So, while Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch is out for all the major platforms, it’s a natural for the Nintendo Switch, fusing Fire Emblem-esque strategy and storytelling with Roguelike progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9ScyPnAxU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That said, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch doesn’t make the best first impression on Nintendo Switch (by way of Switch 2’s compatibility layer), and a big part of that is in-game visuals. I initially started playing the game in handheld mode, and while the character artwork is detailed and characterful, the in-game visuals seemed very basic indeed. It looks better when you play docked, but it’s still pretty rough around the edges. It’s a testament to the quality of the gameplay that you’ll find yourself drawn into the tactical action, despite this, and the longer I spent with the game, the less I noticed.</p>


<p>There’s definitely a strong flavour of Fire Emblem in every gulp of Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. You move your team of characters around a grid, facing off against a slew of different enemies, and if you want to be successful, you have to consider positioning, weaponry types, weaknesses and individual strengths.</p>


<p>While Fire Emblem has a straightforward weapon triangle of strengths and weaknesses to consider, Veil of the Witch takes this a step further with weapons and armour types with paired affinities. That means that heavy armour is weak to axes, leather armour is weak to swords, and cloth armour is weak to spears and bows. Besides that, some larger creatures will have different weaknesses depending on their positioning, and you’ll pour a lot of thought into where you’re going to send your team.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s melee, ranged and magical attacks and support spells, as well as unique moves for each character. For all of these traditional trappings, the roguelike progression, and multiple runs into this fantasy world really do bring a newfound sense of freshness to the tactical action. Part of that comes down to decisions.</p>
<p>Every time your characters level up, you’re given two possible upgrades to equip them with, so you have to decide between better defence and improved attack, or enhanced movement and increased critical hit chance. Each run, there’s a chance to build them differently, and having that extra sword to spin makes Veil of the Witch consistently compelling.</p>

<p>Alongside levelling up, there’s further choices to be made following each battle. Here you can choose your route through the world, with an indication of the type of reward you’ll gain for heading in that direction,</p>
<p>Despite the repeated trips through the game world, there’s a story to be told, with Sable, the titular Eidolon, using your crew to further her own shadowy motives, bringing you back from the dead over and over again. While Veil of the Witch is often a little worthy, and there’s a lot of thou, thee and verily in the dialogue, you start to find the characters quietly endearing, learning more about them as you progress, often via one-to-one conversations back at your base.</p>
<p>Once again, that brings the Fire Emblem comparisons come even closer, but the feel and tone of Veil of the Witch is fundamentally very different from Intelligent Systems’ iconic franchise, and it absolutely stands as its own thing. It draws you in far more effectively than you might be expecting, and if you’re looking for a tactical RPG that is a little more respectful of your time, Veil of the Witch fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>Runs probably do run longer than you’d expect for the Roguelite genre. You’ll find battlefields that you thought you were finishing up suddenly beset by reinforcements, or small skirmishes where enemy fighters are repeatedly resurrected. These extend your time in certain battles, slowing your progress, especially when you’re facing an almost inevitable death. Equally, there’s as much challenge and depth to each encounter as you’ll find in the best of the genre, and there’s plenty of variation to the way that battles play out, with different conditions changing things up. Overall, I’d rather have the thoughtful, engaging strategy, rather than it becoming a frantic jog through multiple encounters.</p>
