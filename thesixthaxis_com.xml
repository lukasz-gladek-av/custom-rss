		<p>While most gamers will recognise Ninja Gaiden through its full 3D entries from the original Xbox and beyond the series actually began way back in 1988 on the NES (and arcade). The first games were released in Europe as Shadow Warriors with the iconic name being used worldwide with the turn to 3D. While these earlier games are a very different looking beast to the modern ones they do share one key characteristic – they are hard as nails. Before Dark Souls became the shorthand for difficult games it was Ninja Gaiden that held the sadistic crown. Ragebound can continue this trend if you want it to but also contains a more streamlined difficulty setting that is perfect for learning the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/II9CmTRac8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ragebound is developed by The Game Kitchen, most famous for their fantastic Blasphemous titles. These games had a similar hardcore approach but functioned more as search adventures than straight forward action platformers. When the developers were announced there was some speculation that Ninja Gaiden might be taking the turn towards backtracking and levelling up but I can happily report that the new game feels as close to a modern take on the originals as you can get. I tested this by playing through the original on Switch Online but haven’t finished it yet – did I mention that it was hard?</p>


<p>The modern graphics have a great sense of style whilst still being in keeping with the original. The sprites look like a modern update of the best of 16bit aesthetics with colourful environments and hordes of demons to fight. Special mention needs to be made for the soundtrack too which has some of the best rocking game music you’ll hear. I can’t wait to check out the full track list when it releases and anticipate it making an appearance on my shuffle play for quite a while to come.</p>
<p>Chronologically Ragebound fits in alongside the first Ninja Gaiden game in which long-running protagonist Ryu Hayabusa travels to America to honour his father’s will. This is shown through an introductory cutscene that serves to establish new hero Kenji Mozu whilst also setting up a nice tongue in cheek counter to initial complaints about the change in character. Functionally Kenji is similar to Ryu but with a shock of ginger hair to give much needed representation to us carrot tops (technically it’s only my beard that’s ginger but that still counts!).</p>


<p>Unlike the more realistic urban 1980s environment of much of the original game, Ragebound starts off in a timeless Japanese village being attacked by demons. The supernatural enemy here allows for a lot more range in foes than the thugs and ninjas and some are suitably grotesque and challenging. Alongside your standard sword attack some enemies will provide a necessary super charge to your weapon that is needed to quickly defeat shielded enemies and barriers which offers a nice element of strategy. Secondary throwable weapons are also available when you have enough ninja charge which are useful for picking off tricky enemies or inflicting quick damage on bosses. Most interesting of all is the ability to bounce on enemies and projectiles which feels very in keeping with the Blasphemous titles but utilised in a more traditional platforming game.</p>
<p>The demo I played included the first level and also a couple of later ones that showed an extra gameplay mechanic in which Kenji seems to have been fused with another mysterious character who he can call on to explore a shadowy alternative world that interacts with the main one. This adds an environmental puzzle aspect to these levels that is really interesting although I do question how much it’ll break the flow of the action.</p>
<p>Once the demo levels are beaten a hard mode is unlocked that plays a lot more like the original in terms of enemy challenge and infrequent checkpoints. This promises to be a suitable challenge for those looking for that and I’m intrigued to see whether this stays as an unlockable or if it’ll be open to choose as a first play experience.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is an absolute blast and really manages to combine the past and present to produce a game that looks and controls brilliantly. The added hard mode continues the legacy of the series whilst the standard one feels more accessible to newcomers (or oldies like me whose reactions aren’t what they used to be). When the full game comes out it promises to be a real standard bearer for traditional 2d arcade platformers and I am champing at the bit to get my hands on it.</p>

		<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/spacecraft-is-the-new-game-from-shiro-games/">SpaceCraft was revealed as the new game from Shiro Games</a>, developer of Wartales, Northgard, and Dune: Spice Wars. Now, Shiro Games has released a brand new developer video for the multiplayer space sim, which goes into looking at flying a ship through space and wandering around a space station which will serve as a hub and a base.</p>
<p><iframe title="SpaceCraft | Devblog | Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K1AHjgfBMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“SpaceCraft&nbsp;is an ambitious game for us, and one I’ve always dreamed of making,”</em> says lead designer and Shiro Games CEO Nicolas Carnasse. <em>“One of the things Shiro always strives to do is combine big design ideas in a way that just makes sense when players pick it up, and I think&nbsp;SpaceCraft&nbsp;is a perfect example of that philosophy.”</em></p>
<p>The developer diary for SpaceCraft kicks off with space flight, which players will be able to do with their own customisable ship. As you fly through the void, you will be able to look for new planets which you can touch down upon to search for resources that you and everyone needs to rebuild civilisation. As you find these resources, you can build facilities to mine them. From here you can create full industries that cover everything from mining to transporting the good. Players can work together to create organisations and trade routes to get the resources to where they need to go. On the space station, you can modify the ship with various modules depending on what you need, be it a mining ship or a weapons ship. Every module will impact the handling of the ship, so you will need to balance things properly. The space station will also have shared hubs where players can communicate and trade with each other.</p>

<p>In SpaceCraft, humanity has had to leave the Milky Way after a devastating defeat by the Tripods. The remnants travel through a portal that delivers them to an uncharted galaxy, where humanity must learn to rebuild and survive. SpaceCraft will launch later this year for PC.</p>

		<p>Konami has announced that it will be hosting a stream on Thursday June 12th, called Konami Press Start, which will be air at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM BST/ 3:00 PM CEST. Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be present during the showcase, plus other announcements.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Konami are being pretty specific with the timing, stating the stream will last 37 minutes. So, we have two games confirmed for the showcase but they probably won’t take up the entire runtime. It is likely there will be some update regarding eFootball, possibly around the Club World Cup, since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/fifa-and-konami-sign-partnership-deal/">FIFA and Konami signed a partnership deal</a> back in October. That still leaves a vast library of IPs that Konami can draw on. People will likely be hoping for mention of a new Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid Collection Vol.2, mention of more Yu-Gi-Oh, and Bomberman. Maybe we’ll see some very dormant IPs turn up too like Zone of the Enders or Bloody Roar. It is likely the company will show something completely new too.</p>
<p>We will know exactly what Konami has up its sleeve in just a few days time.</p>
