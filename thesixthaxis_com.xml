		<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">Killing Floor 3 was delayed just weeks before launch</a> by Tripwire Interactive following feedback from the closed beta. The team put it bluntly that after receiving the feedback they had missed the mark with Killing Floor 3, so would take more time to develop it. Today, Tripwire Interactive has confirmed a new release date for the game, and it is going to be July 24th. The announcement comes ahead of the studio’s PAX East panel where they will talk about the design of Killing Floor 3.</p>

<p><em>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3</em><em>, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,”&nbsp;</em>said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive.&nbsp;<em>“The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we’re thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</em></p>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has brought back the ability to pre-order the game, having cancelled and refunded pre-orders for Killing Floor 3 when the delay came in March. We went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying <em>“Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</em></p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will be released for PC via Steam &amp; Epic, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
