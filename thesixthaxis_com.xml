		<p>Capcom has hosted a pre-launch community update for Monster Hunter Wilds, responding to player feedback from the open beta. The update goes into the changes players can expect when Monster Hunter Wilds launches, including performance targets, weapon balancing, and equipping skills for your gear. The full community update is approximately one hour and 20 minutes long, so there is a summary after the video. Capcom has stated that things mentioned in the video could change in the future, and there are more things the developers are addressing that were not covered.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’ performance is the first topic that is touched upon in the video, particularly the Steam version. In the update, one of the big announcements is that the development team may be able to lower the recommended graphics board specs. On the console side the prioritise gameplay will be locked at 30fps while prioritising framerate will lock at 60fps. On the Xbox Series S however, it looks like the framerate will be 30fps.</p>
<p>The gameplay changes coming to Monster Hunter Wilds include making weapon hits feeling more weighty, especially when it comes to finishers and big moves. Friendly fire will also be mitigated further including for upswinging hammer attacks. The Shockproof Jewel will allow players to negate damage reactions too. Pop up camps and fast travel will be available in the full version, so you will not have to slog it all the way to a monster’s location. The rate at which monsters move between different locations will be brought in line with Monster Hunter World. In the Wilds beta, monsters were frequently moving between areas and this was a glitch that has been addressed.</p>
<p>Weapons have been adjusted for the main release as well, with Insect Glaive, Lance, Switch Axe and Sword &amp; Shield being the ones that players will notice most of the changes for. For the Insect Glaive the Vaulting Dance move will be back, increasing the power of aerial attacks. The Lance will be getting a a Charge Counter, which was previously Counter Thrust. Counter attacks can also be chosen for the Lance. The Switch Axe will be easier to use in the full release too by making it simpler to perform some of the weapon’s moves like Counter Rising Slash. For Sword and Shield the Rising Slash will be usable while guarding, and responsiveness of moves like Perfect Rush has been improved too.</p>

<p>There will be a change to how skills are equipped in Monster Hunter Wilds too. Previously, skills were only equipped to armour but in Wilds, skills will be available for weapons as well. Attack and Guard skills will be equipped to weapons, while other skills like speed eating will be for armour. Upgrading weapons will also provide the chance for skills to upgrade, more skill slots to be unlocked, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Another open beta for Monster Hunter Wilds is being considered, but it would be more for players who did not get to play it the first time, and there would likely only be a couple of additional options added. The changes that were discussed in the update would also not be likely to feature in another open beta, if one was to go ahead. Monster Hunter Wilds is set for 28th February 2025, and it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
