		<p>Even though the game’s long development had morphed into something of a meme, I don’t think anyone was truly prepared for just how big the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong would be this week. Truly, it was close to being the GTA of indie game releases, with other indie developers doing what they could to avoid launching on the same day – of course, anything with a physical launch couldn’t really do that – and then all of the digital storefront feeling the crunch and stumbling as everyone rushed to download.</p>
<p>All of which is to say…. are you playing Silksong this weekend?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andrewww</b> continues to seemingly only ever play games that are just about to leave PlayStation Plus, giving Dead Island 2 and Night in the Woods a try. Alas, neither of them grabbed his attention, but the Alone in the Dark remake managed to survive past the opening few hours. He also continued his journey through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but now he’s got stick drift in one of his controllers so it trying for a warranty replacement. Good luck with that!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week, enjoy the improved weather for the weekend, and we’ll catch you back here on Monday!</p>
