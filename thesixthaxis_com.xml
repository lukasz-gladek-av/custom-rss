		<p>Capcom may have spoiled their own surprise in a safety message for the new Resident Evil Showcase, which will be happening on 15 January 2026 at 10:00 PM (UTC) – which is 10.00PM GMT in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>The official announcement over on <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-uk/">residentevil.com</a> advises that you “Don’t miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem!”. That is to be expected as it is the next game in the series launching on 27th February 2026.</p>


<p>However, in the usual warnings for minors, the website also states, “This content will be age-restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content. Some of the games included in the show aren’t suitable for children.”</p>
<p>Did you spot it? <em>Games</em>. Plural. So that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and at least one other title.&nbsp; However, this may not be a new title, as it is heavily rumoured that Capcom will be releasing previous Resident Evil games on Switch 2 on the same day that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches.&nbsp; A few years ago, rumours circulated about a Resident Evil Zero remake for 2027 and a Resident Evil Code: Veronica remake for 2028, but no further information has been heard about those since.</p>

<p>In case you had forgotten, Resident Evil is also heading back to the big screen with the franchise getting a reboot this September. The movie will not feature any characters from the games and will be an original story set in the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>“It takes place in the world of the games,” Cregger explained to the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Double Toasted podcast</a>. “But most importantly the journey you’ll have as a viewer of watching this movie is going to be similar to the journey you have as a player when you play these games. And what that means is it follows one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>
