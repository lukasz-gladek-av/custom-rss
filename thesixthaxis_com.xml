		<p>Warhammer Survivors is the new game from Auroch Digital, which has previously developed Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun and is working on Boltgun 2. Warhammer Survivors is less Boltgun and more Vampire Survivors in style, and that isn’t a surprise since Auroch Digital has partnered up with poncle and is using their game engine. Warhammer Survivors is an official Survivors game, but standalone and dripping in Warhammer action and lore.</p>

<p>You can really see the common ground between Vampire Survivors and this game, from the style of the pixel art to the pace of movement and the way that upgrades are dropped in boxes.</p>
<p>Players will be able to upgrade weapons and abilities so each run can last longer. Some of those weapons are the Boltgun, the Astartes Chainsword, and the Whirlwind Axes. Auroch Digital has also announced some of the playable characters for Warhammer Survivors including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Malum Caedo<wbr></li>
<li>Kozlowski&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Brother Luca&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<wbr><b>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Neave Blacktalon,</li>
<li>Sharynn Azurwath<wbr></li>
<li>Gotrek Gurnisson<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>These characters and others will be tasked with fighting Skaven and Tyranid swarms.&nbsp; Warhammer Survivors is due to be released in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p>
