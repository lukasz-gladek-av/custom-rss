		<p>Are you getting swept up in the fervour for Pokémon Legends: Z-A this weekend? The newly launched monster battler has made some big changes to the classic formula of the series, that are really striking a bit of a chord.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe that’s less your style, and so you have plans to dip into the Arc Raiders server slam stress test, or keep on keeping on with Battlefield 6, or the many other games that are rushing out this time of year.</p>
