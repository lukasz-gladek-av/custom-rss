		<p>It’s the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and it’s set to be one of the hottest in the UK as well. So I hope you’ve all got plans for both staying out late and for staying cool while doing so. Don’t forget your sunscreen! Unless, of course, you’re intent on bathing in the cool blue glow of computer and TV screens this weekend. Maybe you’re putting the 24Hr Nürburgring on the telly and just letting the weekend wash over you?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> has approached the end of Act1 in Tainted Grail, which has been a 9/10 experience for him so far, as he’s luckily been unaffected by a strange VFX issue that the devs are working to try to resolve. May it remain that way!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dreamsettler, the sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/04/25/patrolling-the-90s-internet-in-hypnospace-outlaw/">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, has been cancelled, a deeply apologetic and saddened Jay Tholen has confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreamsettler is canceled" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uH3UbgEWBxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the 10 minute video blog, Tholen goes into some of the creative struggles that he faced in trying create a sequel to the 2019 indie hit. He heaps praise upon his developers, Mike Lasch and Mark LaCroix, and says that publisher No More Robots were great to work with, and instead shoulders the blame for the cancellation himself, citing difficulties with working in a more structured and precisely budgeted manner.</p>
<p>In the end, it seems that the project basically ran out of money to let Tholen’s emerging, improvisational vision for the sequel come together. They even launched a Patreon a few months ago to try and gain additional funding and support, but this wasn’t enough to support the development. Tholen has said that, if supporters wish, they may request a refund for their last payment, which will come out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Tholen intends to try to release some of the work that had already gone into Dreamsettler, though is not clear on what form this will take and when it can happen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreamsettler Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFvoO7ZaUKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following on from the late 90s OS and internet simulator detective story of Hypnospace Outlaw, Dreamsettler was going to jump ahead to the early 2000s, incorporating a more animated rendition of operating systems and websites from that time, even going so far as to having a fictionalised version of Flash in the game. A key hook was that, with you turning to be an independent private investigator, you would be building your own website within the game, as well as taking on and solving cases.</p>
<p>It’s obviously a real shame that this project couldn’t come together, as Hypnospace is certainly one of the more distinctive and special titles from the past decade.</p>
