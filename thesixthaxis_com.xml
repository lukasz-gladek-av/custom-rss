		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> Closed Technical Test for this coming weekend, bringing the public in to stress test and play the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> co-op shooter spin-off.</p>
<p>Available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC with cross-play enabled, the FBC: Firebreak Closed Technical Test will run from May 15th, 6AM PDT/9AM EDT/2PM BST/4PM EEST, until May 19th, 1:59PM PDT/4:59PM EDT/9:59PM BST/11:59PM EEST.</p>


<p>You can <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">sign up to take part here</a>.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that this is a closed test and Remedy are not allowing public sharing of impressions, screenshots, videos or live streaming. Discussions will be limited to an area of the official Discord server.</p>
<p>The technical test will help Remedy smooth out kinks in the matchmaking and balance for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/fbc-firebreak-release-date-confirmed-for-june/">the game’s full launch next month</a>. Aiming to get as large an intake of invited participants as possible, the tech test will have two of the Jobs in the game,&nbsp;Paper Chase and Ground Control, and access to three of the kits with all equipment unlocked – Garden Gnome, Teapot, and Piggybank – and three of the guns.</p>

<p>For PC players, the system requirements that Remedy are pushing at this time are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li>
<li>Processor: Ryzen 7 3700X or equivalent</li>
<li>Memory: 16GB RAM</li>
<li>Graphics: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, Remedy has shared <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/static/faq">a closed technical test FAQ</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic at that time. It will also be available day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium).</p>

		<p>The Sinking City Remastered has been given a surprise launch by Frogwares, who have made the game available today for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/31/the-sinking-city-remastered-announced/">The Sinking City Remastered&nbsp;</a>was announced at the end of March, along with confirmation that owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S would get this upgrade for free.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City Remastered - Comparison &amp; Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEoQxVMzBEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>”We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em>”, said Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares.</p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game remade in Unreal Engine 5, adding enhanced details to environments and objects. The game has 4K textures and an added photo mode so you can zoom in and check the details for yourself. There is also support f<span>or DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling, as well as new accessibility options.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em>&nbsp;“The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2</a> was announced last year with a release window of 2025, with some funding coming from a Kickstarter. The final amount raised in the Kickstarter was 553,100 euros, way above the target of 100,000 euros.</p>
