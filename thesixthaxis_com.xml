		<p>Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, their rather lovely looking roguelike with a unique twin hero mechanic. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Steam on 19th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mtu17D_rNV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in an oriental setting where the evil forces of the god Magatsu threaten Shinju Village, a group of heroes have come together under the guidance of Towa, the child of a god who is leading the fight for survival.</p>
<p>There’s eight guardians in the game, and you pick not one, but two of them as you head into each run. We were introduced to Rekka and Nishiki, the former of which is a master swordsperson with a focus on combos and AoE attacks, while the latter is a big fish person who’s very mobile… but can’t actually swim. They’re both pitched as beginner-friendly characters to play as.</p>
<p>On each run, you’ll be able to earn Graces, which are abilities that you earn and pick from a randomised selection. Between runs, then there’s a whole village to explore with some neat minigames and side missions that fold back into the progression.</p>

<p>Honestly, this just looks lovely and we look forward to seeing more. The team will release more videos to reveal more of the Guardians in the coming weeks.</p>
