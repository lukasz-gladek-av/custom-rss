		<p>It feels like I’ve spent most of this week playing the game ‘avoiding the Christmas crowds’, but I did get to enjoy my own version of Thanksgiving where I just watched NFL for six hours, and didn’t have to think about turkey for another month. In terms of gaming, I’ve been playing a truckload of Octopath Traveler 0, as well as some more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Tomb Raider Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Besides that, I’ve been checking out Assetto Corsa Rally, and messing with GeForce Now across a bunch of platforms to see how it performs.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/sweet-surrender-review/">Sweet Surrender</a> for review, as well as Halls of Torment and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Bizarrely keen to try and take on the Marvel Rivals PlayStation Cup challenge next week, <strong>Ade</strong> has been practicing by polished off his review of the retro-styled scrolling beat ’em up Marvel Cosmic Invasion. The embargo for that is on Monday, so check out his review then!</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has had a much quieter week. After flitting between a glut of new multiplayer games, he’s back to Ghost of Yotei as he focuses on finishing the main quest.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Duskpunk for review, which is a mix of Citizen Sleeper meets the rough life in a town full of opportunities and misfortune. Sounds great to me!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing the natural pairing of Terrifier: the Artcade game and Spongebob Square pants: Titans of the Tide. This weird gaming concoction has had mixed results, with Steve telling us, “The first was unfortunately pretty rubbish but the second is a solid, albeit short, 3D platformer” He continued, “With those wrapped, I’ve moved onto an indie space horror that’s been years in the making and is wonderfully atmospheric.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been curling himself up into a ball for an upcoming review, while also dabbling with some upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide DLC, and dipping into some cheap Black Friday sale pick ups, like Loop Hero.</p>
<p>And what about you? Have you played anything this week? Why not tell us about it!</p>

			<p>As a known lover of card games, it wasn’t especially surprising that Cross Blitz really appealed to me back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/29/cross-blitz-early-access-review-hearthstone-with-the-heart-of-a-lion/">when I first tried its Early Access launch</a>. Two whole years later, does it still feel as good now that it’s fully released? To put it simply, yes.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all busy people, I’m not going to lead you on, so if that’s all you wanted to know, then you’re done here, but do feel free to leave the page open for a few minutes to help our metrics, and maybe open a couple of other articles too. Thanks!</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an RPG deckbuilder with multiple modes and multiple stories to play through as campaigns, thanks to its cast of different characters. Each of these characters have their own starting decks, and different potential build options as you progress as well. You’re bound to find a character or two you love the most, but at the end of the day, I think they’re all very well-designed and a lot of fun. It’s incredibly cool to nip around maps getting not only upgrades, but also more story about them all as well.</p>


<p>Along with that though, there’s also a roguelike mode, and it’s what can give Cross Blitz a near unlimited lifespan, whether you’ve finished the stories and find yourself wanting a bit more, or just want to snack on the gameplay and aren’t in the mood for reading. Yes, reading is very good for all of us, but some of us get four hours sleep, work too much, and just wanna demolish some enemies, you know?</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t quite hit me in with the Early Access release is just how much Cross Blitz feels like a really polished Game Boy Advance game. I think it’s the visual style mostly, but the whole vibe could easily have been from 20 years ago, and I mean that as a truly gargantuan compliment. Cross Blitz just feels like it’s laser-focused on its core gameplay and deck-building, doing a lot without wasting excess tech on stuff it doesn’t need. It masters mechanics to allow you to min-max, and it wants you to do so to push through some of the hardest battles as well.</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an even better game now as it has even more to do, which is usually how these things go. The full release brings with it a new story campaign, which is in a similar vein to what’s come before, and it remains a lot of fun. The result is a more complete experience with even more cards and mechanics to mes around with, and just so much variety. It feels like you’re getting into the weeds with a really good TCG, but you don’t need to pay for all of it.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cross Blitz is a beautifully made deck builder that feels not only incredibly inventive, but also mechanically dense, and just very satisfying to sink into. On top of that, the looks are exceptionally charming, the music is good, and the vibes are just on point. If you love a good deckbuilder, then you’ll love this, but the campaign modes also mean that this could be the one that grabs you if you’ve only ever bounced off of others due to the roguelike focus.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Creative Aurvana Ace 3 Wireless Earbuds Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/28/creative-aurvana-ace-3-wireless-earbuds-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The name Creative means a great deal in gaming and audio circles. Known as the creator of the Soundblaster range of PC audio cards, their range has expanded to include audio products of all kinds, from the excellent Creative Pebble series of speakers through to gaming headphones with SXFI technology. The Creative Aurvana Ace 3 is the newest edition of their ANC-equipped true wireless earbuds, offering a cost-effective alternative to Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 and the Galaxy Buds Pro 3.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are stem-style true wireless earbuds, available in an eye-catching translucent purple colourway, that’s matched through the charging case and each earbud. There is something quite retro about their look, with a mid-noughties vibe that brings an unexpected wave of nostalgia with it. When it’s paired with the silver band running down each stem, they’re certainly unique-looking, but if you’re hoping for a more understated option, this isn’t it.</p>



<p>They feel light in the hand, which diminishes that premium sensation, but it does mean that you can easily wear them for hours without any fatigue. The earbuds are rated for 7 hours, which is an hour less than the AirPods Pro 3 but an hour more than the AirPods Pro 2, with a total of 26 hours of playback with the charging case, all of which played out pretty effectively in our testing.</p>
<p>The charging case lid hinge is a little flimsy, but the body of the case itself feels solid and is the perfect size for chucking in your pocket. It also includes wireless charging, which is a very welcome inclusion. At half the price of their top-end rivals, it’s a good start for the Aurvana Ace 3.</p>

<p>The audio pairing and setup is a little more convoluted than its core competitors, though, as there’s a suite of features to set up to make the most of the Ace 3. The Creative app handles nearly everything here, but you also need the separate SXFi app, which seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, you use Mimi sound personalisation to create a listening profile. This involves a short hearing test – best done in a quiet space – and the results then tailor the output to your own ears. It’s a stark difference, particularly factoring in my 40+ year old hearing, and the years of damage I’ve done to them by, well, listening to headphones that I’ve turned up too loud.</p>
<p>After that, you can choose your EQ presets to tailor the audio to your personal taste, or delve deeper into a custom EQ setup. Even if you’re not clued up about audio, frequencies and kHz, it’s all easy enough to mess around with in search of the roght sound.</p>

<p>The Aurvana Ace sound very good indeed, even without any tuning. Part of that is the ability to utilise the best audio codecs out there, translating LDAC, AptX Lossless and AptX Adaptive into a seamless listening experience. The Ace 3 are equipped with Snapdragon Sound, so if your Android device meets the right specification, not only will you benefit from the high resolution audio, you’ll experience fewer connection issues, and benefit from exceptionally low latency, making your mobile gaming just that bit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Putting them to the test with some of my favourite tracks, I was immediately surprised by just how detailed the audio was from the Ace 3. Billy Eilish’s No Time To Die sounded suitably epic, with her vocals sounding so precise that it felt as though she was singing directly to me.</p>
<p>Changing tack, the brutal cacaphony of Pupil Slicer’s Heather was delivered in spades, losing none of its venom on its way into your ears. It’s always incredibly satisfying to hear new elements in songs, and the Ace 3s combined technologies make that a certainty. The dual xMEMS drivers here certainly help with audio separation, and bass response in particular is fantastic, being rounded and full, without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>The hybrid ANC proved moderately effective at blocking out background noise, though it is a clear step behind the Airpods Pro 3 and Bose Quietcomfort Ultra, and on a windy walk to work, they struggled against the wind quite a bit. Still, at this price point, it’s effective enough, and with the quality of the audio itself being so high, I don’t think anyone will be too disappointed with their performance.</p>

<p>As with many less expensive earbuds, the touch controls aren’t quite as reliable as their more expensive brethren. The Aurvana Ace 3 does keep things pretty simple, and there’s only one touch point on the main body of each earbud, rather than a panel or squeezable section. That does make changing the volume less efficient, requiring a long press on each earbud to move the volume up and down, and if you’re running that’s a real pain, but it does work, once you’ve adapted to it.</p>
<p>Phone call quality is good, possibly helped by the ability to use Snapdragon Sound via the connection to my Honor Magic V5, and family members confirmed that my voice was clear and easy to hear during calls. It helps to wrap up a compelling package from Creative, and if you’re looking for an excellent-sounding pair of earbuds at a mid-range pricepoint, you’d be hard pressed to find better.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are amongst the easiest earbuds to live with in this price bracket, and though their RRP is £140, you can currently snag them for a slightly bonkers £90 via the Creative website. The Nothing Ear (3) are also worth considering, currently coming in at £139.99, though they have worse battery life than the Ace 3 and are noticeably heavier too.</p>
