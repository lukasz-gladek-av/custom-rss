		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that co-op <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will set you back $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99, but will also be available day one via&nbsp;PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium). A Deluxe Edition will be $49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99, or an upgrade for the difference of $10 / €10 / £7.</p>


<p>The announcement came through the April Developer Update which also gave a longer look at a newly revealed mission, Hot Fix, as well as another look at &nbsp;Paper Chase, where sticky notes have been all spookified.</p>

<p>Other Jobs revealed so far have also showed&nbsp;a Furnace that spread fire across the Maintenance Sector, needing players to turn on sprinklers and fans to douse the flames, or the pink Exogenic Mass, which explodes if you touch it.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll have some buddies by your side to give you some morale-boosting pats on the back to get back to work. FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op shooter, loosely in the vein of Left 4 Dead. In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.</p>
<p>Playing the game will tap into a system of rewards called Requisitions, which are a free way to unlock cosmetics and gear like weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more using in-game currency earned through gameplay. There will be no limited-time windows or rotating stores, so no FOMO.</p>
<p>Classified Requisitions are the premium counterpart, which can be purchased with real money and will always be purely cosmetic. You can see these with the Deluxe Edition, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Remedy also gave a look at the longer term picture for the game. Post-launch two more missions will be added to the game through 2025, with more updates planned for 2026. All playable content will be free to all players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not long now before we get to set foot back in the Oldest House to blow up small pieces of paper!</p>
