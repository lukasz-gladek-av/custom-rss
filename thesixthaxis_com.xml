			<p>Sony’s remaster strategy remains a little baffling for ardent gamers, now that we’re firmly in an age of backward compatibility. You could argue that there’s clearly diminishing returns in graphical advancements, but they wouldn’t be sticking with this plan if it wasn’t showing some benefits. From Spider-Man Remastered to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn</a> and now Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, there’s a layered reasoning for each release. They bring the games back to the forefront of discussion and release schedules, nudge sticker prices back up a notch, tie in with TV and movie projects, and more. And with games now taking longer than ever to make, they’re good projects to let developers gain experience, try out new techniques, push the envelope a little further while the sequel’s production is still going through the gears.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the case of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/01/sony-acquires-pc-porting-specialists-nixxes-software/">Sony’s PC porting specialists at Nixxes</a> taking on a very different job, in partnership with Guerrilla Games, broadening the scope of what that studio is charged with doing for a full remaster in the latest iteration of the Decima Engine. While Nixxes was able to automate some parts of this, dropping new replacement assets in place with systemic changes, an awful lot has required a manual pass and complete overhauls with new techniques.</p>


<p>This could have come at the cost of performance, but thankfully it really hasn’t. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered offers 30fps, 40fps (on a 120Hz screen) and 60fps modes, and there’s going to be some trade-offs here, but I felt like the 60fps performance mode looked absolutely fantastic. It matches the frame rate that the original game can get when played on PS5, but brings all the improvements we’re about to delve into, keeps a high resolution and has higher-quality anti-aliasing and upscaling. The frame rate and resolution metrics will only be pushed further with the PS5 Pro, which this game natively supports.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest change and improvement is an overhaul for many of the conversations and dialogues in the game. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">one of the weakest aspects of the original release in 2017</a>, with particularly stilted-looking animations for a lot of dialogue and fixed camera angles that lacked the dynamism of the rest of the game. To improve this, they’ve gone back to the motion capture stage, grabbing new motion capture with which to liven up the thousands of dialogue elements in the game, and going through a bunch of rather complicated steps to feed those back in place.</p>


<p>The end result is worth the effort, as you go from the very workmanlike style of the original to something much closer to Horizon Forbidden West, and it’s seemingly across the board. Even relatively straightforward chats with a simple side quest giver now has the camera pulled back a bit, the opportunity for more upper body movement, more nuanced facial animation and character expression. It doesn’t change the story, of course, but it makes its delivery a smidgeon more engaging.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Nixxes has gone through the game with a fine-tooth comb to find other places to improve. The world lighting has been updated to use some of the techniques from the PS5-exclusive expansion Burning Shores, but there’s also needed the world lighting to be be redone by hand, just to try and match the same mood of the original with the fidelity of its sequel. The snow effects from the Frozen Wilds DLC have been applied to all snowy regions in the game, and there’s now the ability for a snow shader to build up on characters, and screen-space reflections help streams and bodies of water look so much better.</p>

<p>In general, it’s the lighting that can lead to the most striking differences. To give just one example, if you head down to the densely wooded, jungle-like biome to the south of the world map, the depth of colour feels much greater, the shadow darker and the streams of light and robot-induced lens flair all the more impactful.</p>
<p>The team also highlighted key areas, such as the ground of Meridian City, that were completely redone, the manual pass to manmade structures, the new skin shaders for character models to match Horizon Forbidden West –&nbsp;characters have that peach fuzz of hair to their skin, for example – and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of these are very fine tweaks that you’ll barely have a chance to notice while sprinting through the world, and will stake a good long look to really appreciate when comparison set scenes and stills. What I will say is that Meridian City does definitely feel more lively than it does in the original. There is maybe a doubling of NPC counts for the same time of day, adding a bit more of the hustle and bustle that you might expect in a capital city.</p>

<p>This does, however, highlight some of the dumb-as-bricks NPC pathfinding, though. I’ve seen a few characters spin on the spot, as they encounter other characters walking toward them, children walk through someone else’s legs, and instead of sticking to paths, they might clamber over rocks alongside.</p>
<p>That, then goes to highlight some of the occasionally wacky physics that clothes can have, whether it’s Erend’s chunky armour flapping up over his legs while walking, or capes and cloaks of background character whipping around when there’s camera cuts during dialogue. Hair is seemingly less susceptible to this now, or at least in Aloy’s case.</p>
<p>As impressive as all of this is, though…. I’m pleasantly surprised with how well Horizon Zero Dawn still holds up. Sure, an awful lot of people would have played this game originally on base PS4, but PS4 Pro gave a lot of enhancements just from the jump up in resolution and checkerboarding, and a patch was released a few years ago that allowed the game to run at 4K checkerboarding with 60FPS on PS5. That level of performance on PS5 is fantastic.</p>
<p>It makes this upgrade feel rather inessential…. the saving grace being that upgrading on this occasion is rather cheap. Anyone that owns the original game, whether that’s the base game, the complete edition, or the freebie handout during Days of Play, can pay $10 for a pretty decent visual overhaul, and return to Aloy’s original adventure with a smattering of new finery.</p>

			<p>When Shadows of the Damned was first released back in 2011, the expectations were huge given the collaboration between industry giants Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami. These two titans of Japanese gaming combined to produce a cult classic that still feels unique in its sleazy grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour. I view the original as part of a previously lost trilogy of 360/PS3 era horror infused titles alongside Lollipop Chainsaw and Splatterhouse, all three of which embraced the absurd and relished their combination of silliness and ultra-violence. With that in mind I’m crossing my fingers for a Splatterhouse remaster, even if music licensing issues might make this a futile wish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwpT42plQiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Getting back to the matter in hand, Shadows of the Damned is a B-movie style fever dream that takes huge inspiration from low budget horror whilst depicting a twisted take on a classic damsel in distress narrative. You play as Garcia ‘fucking’ Hotspur, a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking demon hunter whose exploits attract the attention of the Lord of Hell, Fleming. As vengeance for the demons lost to Hotspur, Fleming abducts his girlfriend, the mysterious Paula and drags her to the underworld. In order to rescue her, Garcia grabs his Johnson (the ridiculously named demon that serves as Garcia’s gun and motorbike) and jumps through the closing portal to Hell. What follows is a high octane third-person shooter with linear progression and light-based puzzles.</p>


<p>Graphically, the Hella Remaster mostly just changes the resolution, but in going up to 4K, so much detail can be revealed and appreciated, really helping the distinctive visual design to pop. The aesthetics have a comic book feel to them with bold lines and moody environments whilst light and dark plays a huge role in the overall gameplay mechanics. The original voice acting is retained, fortunately so, as everyone is clearly having a lot of fun delivering some of the ripest lines you’ll hear this year. Musically there is a spooky mariachi feel which further adds to the Mexican Day of the Dead stylings.</p>


<p>Shadows of the Damned is an over the shoulder third-person shooter at heart and this style of gameplay has not been touched or refined in the remaster. On the one hand this is a good thing in terms of gaming history but it is starting to show its age and certainly doesn’t live up to the likes of the Resident Evil 4 Remake and its shift into modern controls. Garcia takes up a substantial part of the screen and controls relatively clunkily. The game doesn’t often require swift reactions and evasion so this isn’t generally a problem, but a couple of chase sequences remain just as annoying here as they were in 2011.</p>
<p>Gunplay is the main focus and it is here that you must rely on gripping your trusty Johnson. This demon initially takes the form of a solid pistol that does a decent amount of damage but as you progress you unlock different gun forms and upgrades for each. By the end you’ll be spraying hot leaded death from your Johnson. Um, the innuendos here are inevitable and a key part of the game’s particular brand of humour.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game you see Johnson transform into a motorbike that Hotspur rides on the highways of Hell but this is never returned to as a gameplay mechanic unfortunately. There is some gameplay variety added later on with several 2D shmup levels that do help to break things up somewhat.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most iconic level, and certainly the one I most vividly remembered from my original time with the game, is the introduction of the Big Boner, a huge cannon form of Johnson with puerile dialogue to match. The sheer ridiculousness of this level is perhaps a litmus test for your engagement with Shadows of the Damned. For me it is so obviously camp and self aware that I can’t help but love it, so wonderfully skewering the excessively macho idea of the gun as a penis extension. However, I am aware that this over the top presentation is a somewhat acquired taste.</p>
<p>The representation of Hostpur’s ‘angel’ Paula remains just as awkward as it always was, as she runs around Hell in a series of more revealing nightwear. This perfectly suits the grindhouse setting though, and Shadows of the Damned isn’t really a game that you should look to for progressive ideas. The aim here is clearly to revel in the politically incorrect and the pulp trash inspirations. This pulp approach can be seen in the increasingly grotesque and disgusting boss fights that will test your pattern recognition and shooting accuracy. These are all stand out moments that also require you to use your Johnson’s secondary function.</p>

<p>Alongside the lethal ammunition fired by Johnson, you can also fire light shots that illuminate dark areas, remove lethal clouds of demonic darkness, and stun enemies. This is a recurring mechanic that adds a welcome dose of puzzle solving to the gunplay and there are some really well designed moments here. One particular highlight is a Rubik’s Cube like level where you have to rearrange platforms to find the exit – a level that uncannily predicts a similar one in the Bloober Team Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is a great version of the original that offers limited but welcome updates such as resolution increases, faster load times and a much requested New Game+ mode. The unique grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour remains as distinctive as they always were and it is here that the appeal of Shadows of the Damned lives or dies. If the absurd humour and over the top ideas are your cup of blood then this is an easy recommend even if you don’t have nostalgic memories of the original. Get ready to grab your Johnson and kill some demons.	</p></div>
