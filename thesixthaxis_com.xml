		<p>The first teaser for the upcoming movie based on Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn game</a> has revealed how the film will handle the branching narrative that is so integral to the game. Are they going to go all Clue and have<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuUrxRdJv9U"> a random ending for every time you watch it</a>? Will it be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> where you whip out your phone to make decisions? Well…. no.</p>
<p>In the game, the characters can die in multiple ways, so you can play through it quite a few times and get completely different outcomes. A film is a linear experience, so the director David F. Sandberg has explained that within the story, time will rewind and loop back to the start, giving the characters opportunities to try something different when they restart the night, but having to confront what Sandberg describes as being different horror genres.</p>


<p>The teaser also shows that while the location is still mountainous they have not opted to film in winter and replicate the chilly atmosphere in the game, even in its original tale. We also get our first look at Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game. He voiced and motion captured the role of Dr. Alan J. Hill (known in-game as “The Analyst”), the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice.</p>
<p>The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell. It has been stated that the film is set in the same continuity as the game so we may get a cameo from some of the original cast, although I suspect Rami Malek’s fee may be slightly larger than when he appeared in the game.</p>

<p>Until Dawn is set to arrive in movie theatres on April 25th, 2025.</p>

<p>Sony recently remastered Until Dawn for PlayStation 5 which I <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">reviewed</a>, giving it a sold 8/10. “Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</p>
