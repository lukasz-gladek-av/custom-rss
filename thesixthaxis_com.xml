		<p>Bethesda will reveal the long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake tomorrow, the renovated classic expected to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and available with ‘day one’ tiers of Xbox Game Pass as well. It’s anticipated that this will be a ‘shadow drop’ launch, with the reveal coming alongside the game’s release.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake will be revealed on Tuesday 22nd April at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST, and you can watch it here on YouTube:</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion has been reported and rumoured to be in the works for close to half a decade, first appearing in unredacted court filings, with further reports in the last few years, and then the slam dunk leak last week coming from the website of developer Virtuos.</p>
<p>A batch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-screenshots-leak-from-developer-website/">Oblivion remake images</a> were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they were hastily copied across to other hosts before Virtuos could pull their site offline.</p>

<p>Getting our first look at the game, what was immediately clear was the huge jump up in graphical detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>
<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and with the game so close to being in our hands, it will be fascinating to see how it has come together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>Not long to go…</p>
