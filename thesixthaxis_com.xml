		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 continues to nab the headlines as the newest and most exciting kid on the block, and this week has all been about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which is what I’m planning to play all day today. Besides that, I’ve been putting a load of time into Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, a spot of Mario Party, and dipping in and out of Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is currently playing Shadow Labyrinth for review, but you’ll have to wait until next week for his thoughts on it! Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> went for something decidedly more retro. He told us, “I don’t exactly know why I was drawn to it, but this week I ended up playing (and getting the platinum trophy for) Twisted Metal. I remember taking the PS5 emulated version for a spin when it first dropped on PlayStation Plus and really, really not liking it. However, accepting the game’s primitive design and rough edges, I went back and had a good time with it before jumping into the sequel which is slightly more polish albeit tougher.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> played the sneak ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/14/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-review/">Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</a> for review and after giving it a 10/10, it’s clear that he thinks it’s absolutely awesome! He says, “It’s the best stealth game I’ve played since Mark of the Ninja, I definitely recommend giving this debut release from River Island Games a go.”</p>
<p>This week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered in Chronological mode, Peglin and Neverwinter Nights 2 Remastered for review, and a bunch of Switch games, including Breath of the Wild, “which is obviously excellent, but the weapon durability can die in a fire.” He continued, “I also played the “worry about my PS5 after it overheated” game, which I don’t recommend.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been catching up on a flurry of review titles as mid-July seems to be the new peak release season. He says, “I’ve polished off the standalone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/17/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review/">RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business</a>, which was actually better paced than the original and I had a lot fun with, the great indie grindhouse point n click The Drifter, decent 2.5 platformer Once Upon a Puppet, and about to get stuck into The Necromancer’s Tale – the latter review will be next week now. I’ve treated myself to DK Bananza but might wait until I have my gallbladder operation and make it my recovery game.” Hope everything goes well with that Steve!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has not really played Destiny 2. As unbelievable as that is, instead he’s gone back to The Callisto Protocol which he bought and never really sat down to play. His review? “It’s quite good.”</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>, who was charged with our Donkey Kong Bananza review this week and had a smashing time with it, but has now shifted focus from ape grunts and whoops to the grunts of V6, V8 and V12 engines in Le Mans Ultimate.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>
