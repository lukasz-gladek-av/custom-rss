		<p>Following on from last month’s reveal, 3D Realms and Saber Interactive have released a brand new trailer for Painkiller with this one focusing specifically on weapons. The trailer confirms there are seven weapons in total for players to use including the Stakegun, Electrodriver, SMG, Handcannon, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and of course the titular Painkiller.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J41CouSSWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Stakegun impales foes with with high damage stakes, the Electrodriver fires off shurikens that will bounce off surfaces, the SMG fires lots of bullets in bursts, the Shotgun will deal high damage close up and staggers foes, the Handcannon hits hard from distance, the Rocket Launcher takes out groups, and the Painkiller hooks on to enemies and shreds them up.&nbsp; All of the weapons will have primary and alternative fire modes along with upgrades with bonuses, and elemental rounds including &nbsp;fire, ice, electro and kinetic.</p>
<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven. The way to redeem yourself is by blasting away the demons of purgatory in an attempt to stop the fallen angel Azazel’s invasion of Earth. Painkiller can be playable solo and will also support co-op for up to three players. Painkiller is due to release this autumn for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

		<p>Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with some older Switch titles, but not all of them. Nintendo have categorised all the games they have tested into three groups: ‘Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2’, ‘Games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues’, and ‘Games with issues that are planned to be addressed’. Additionally there is a small number of games that will work but not with the Switch 2 Joy-con 2 controllers, you will need a Switch 1 Joy-con to play them.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the games that have been tested and their category, but please be aware this list may change, check the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Site</a> for the latest update.</p>
<h3>Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>
<p>These games have been tested and currently are not booting correctly on Switch 2 and therefore cannot be played. However, for all of the titles Nintendo state that “This issue is being investigated” so they may be patched at a later date.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friend%E2%80%99s-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more.1167678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friends-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CI Games has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> Version 2.0, a huge update to the game that brings improvements to combat, characters, adds shared progression in co-op, and also introduces a free Friend’s Pass scheme to the game.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone update, the game is at steep 67-72% discount through the PlayStation Spring Sale until 23rd April, until 24th April on Epic, and until 1st May on Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - VERSION 2.0 (Free Friend’s Pass, Shared Progression Co-op) | PC, PS5, Xbox X|S" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the free Friend’s Pass, you need to purchase just one copy of the game in order to play co-op, inviting any other person that you like to join, much like the same scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction</a>. A special Friend’s Pass version of the game is now available across PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5, giving offline access to the tutorial and character creator, and also allowing for full crossplay co-op.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the shared progression in co-op now saves all main story progress for both players that start a new game together, so long as you’ve defeated a similar number of main bosses. Both players retain their loot, 100% vigor and can revive one another in an online session. The previous co-op progression style is also retained, if you prefer that.</p>

<p>Read more about the nitty-gritty of how this works in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLordsOfTheFallen/comments/1k1g6bk/lotf_v20_coop_faq/">FAQ on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>These are already pretty significant additions, but CI Games has continued to iterate on the gameplay since the last update, version 1.7, was released in December. Version 2.0 has revamped combat and movement with smoother animations, weapon response, lock-on, evasions and more. There’s now a dedicated jump button for improved platforming, too.</p>
<p>The character creator has been overhauled, leading into an improved tutorial, and there’s a modernised UI and HUD through the game as well.</p>
<p>“Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates” said Marek Tymninski, CEO of CI Games. “The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.”</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen underwhelmed upon its original release in 2023, despite having its intriguing twinned world mechanic and looking to be a more distinctive game than the 2014 title that it supplanted. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review/">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, Jason said, “I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</p>
<p>A sequel is in development, with an expected release in 2026, so it’s high time that CI Games wrap up the continued support of this title and put their full focus onto the next game.</p>

		<p>While we all look ahead to gorging ourselves on chocolate eggs in a few days time, the short week and extra long weekend will also give plenty time for playing more games than usual. That’s what the future holds, but what about the past? What have we all been playing the last seven days?</p>
<p>There’s been an awful lot of Blue Prince being played in my house, but not by me outside of when I helped with a light switching puzzle. Instead, I’ve made the smallest of starts on Xenoblade Chronicles 2, finally getting round to a game that I must have bought about 6 years ago now, and I’ve touched on a couple games for preview in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Dom’s been away all week on holiday, taking his Switch and 3DS along for company – no doubt hoping to snag a StreetPass visitor or two on his travels – though he’s not actually told me what, if anything, he’s managed to play. So I’m going to suggest that they’ve spent the whole week playing Mario Party games.</p>
<p>Aran has found himself managing Promise Mascot Agency, and as he nears the end of the story, he says that Pinky is likely to go down as the best supporting character of this year – something that Pinky and the Brain fans would certainly agree on.</p>

<p>Sticking with the A’s, Ade has played more Atomfall while he takes a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He’s had fun playing a spot of “Danger Cricket”, as I’m calling it, knocking away thrown grenades with his cricket bat, and generally having a lovely time in the Lake District. He’s also made a return to Helldivers 2.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, has not taken a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, eliminating a few more targets from&nbsp;Yasuke and Naoe’s naughty lists – “I’m not particularly fond of the game’s ever-expanding objective board which seems to sprout new quests every time you look away, though it does give me plenty to do while travelling between story mission markers.”</p>
<p>Alongsdie that, his daughter is getting more interested in video games, so they’ve been playing My Friend Peppa Pig and Cars 3.</p>
<p>It’s been a bit of Hogwarts Legacy and Terraria for Gamoc, as he’s now wrapped up the main story of the former, while Miguel has been playing&nbsp; Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, a bunch of The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, and a little pinch of Blue Prince.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with Steve:</p>
<p>“This week I have played through South of Midnight which I absolutely loved, and took your advice by downloading the soundtrack which has got plenty of repeat plays. I also continued my Sisyphean quest to 100% Lego Skywalker Saga which is ongoing (perhaps eternally). Got lost in Metroid Dread so waiting til I can play it docked for a clearer view of the map. Did manage to deflect one EMMI attack which made me feel like a boss until I got myself stuck in a dead end and was killed immediately after… Finally, I’ve played a couple of small indie games for review.”</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What have you played this week, and what do you have in store for the doubly long weekend?</p>
