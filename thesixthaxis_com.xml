		<p>EA has released a new deep dive for EA Sports FC 26, with the video expanding on what we saw in the announcement trailer which was the changes to the gameplay. That includes the competitive and authentic gameplay styles, which leads into how things will proceed on the pitch. You can check out the full details in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Every aspect of gameplay has been addressed for FC 26 including dribbling, pace, passing,<br>
tackling, shooting, goalkeeping, and physicality. There have also been things removed from this entry including agile dribbling, and timed finishing. Some of the updates that EA mentions are specifically for current generation consoles and not the previous generation. One of those updates is dynamic dribbling with animations refined to take into account player height, the distance between the ball and player when they are dribbling. The jog speed of dribbling has also been increased. Movement has been overhauled so players are more agile and do not feel as heavy as in previous games. Within this there are other acceleration types including explosive, controlled and lengthy. For explosive and lengthy player attributes are key, and are broken down as follows:</p>
<p>● Explosive<br>
○ Agility minimum 65<br>
○ (Agility – Strength) &gt;= 10<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 80<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height maximum 182cm (~6’0”)<br>
■ Female height maximum 162cm (~5’4”)</p>
<p>● Lengthy<br>
○ Strength minimum 65<br>
○ (Strength – Agility) &gt;= 4<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 40<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height minimum 183 cm (~6’1”)<br>
■ Female height minimum 164cm (~5’5”)</p>

<p>Controlled is for those players that do not meet the above criteria. Goalkeepers have also been reworked so they are more responsive, position themselves better, and are better to play as. One key element for goalkeepers is the use of machine learning in Reinforcement Learning goalkeeper positioning. EA states, <em>“This new system uses machine learning to help AI-controlled goalkeepers make more realistic decisions about where to position themselves in the box. By analyzing countless scenarios, the AI can now better cut down angles and react to different types of attacks while adjusting their position more intelligently. It’s important to note that RL Positioning is only active in certain situations, and is only used to position the Goalkeeper. The system is not active when making a save or </em><br>
<em>performing a catch.”</em></p>
<p>Passing is going to be more fluid as the animations have been improved so players can pass in wider angles, and first touch animations will be improved to. Through passes have been overhauled too, with the receivers better selected for ground and through passes. Lob passes will see the ball go into areas where there are fewer obstructions as well. With shooting, angles have been refined too so there are wider angles to fire from. Attacking and defensive movement has been addressed in FC 26 so player positioning is more fluid, with players more likely to remain onside too. When defending players will man mark when attacks are occurring near the goal.</p>
<p>There are a lot of changes coming to EA Sports FC 26, which has been needed after FC 25 failed to bring any significant changes following FC 24. EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is no longer going to be released on September 5th, Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau have announced. Instead, the new release date will be October 31st due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that there has been a delay in manufacturing the physical copies of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and the second is that the extended window allows for additional development of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment wrote, <em>“Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025. Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us. This delay will also give the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself and we would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of Terminator 2D: NO FATE together. As such, this delay will apply to both physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>From the moment we announced Terminator 2D: NO FATE, the response has been absolutely amazing and truly humbling.So, to all of you, thank you so much for your support. We know that this news is disappointing and we appreciate your understanding. We are dedicated to delivering the best release possible for Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we look forward to sharing more of the game with you soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>
