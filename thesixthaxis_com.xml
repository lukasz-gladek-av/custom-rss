		<p>Moi Rai Games has released a major quality of life update for roguelike monster battler RPG Aethermancer. This new update, which is update 0.5.0.8, adds the new monster Ravager, a Combat Inspect feature, and the ability to redistribute equipment among monsters. Ravager’s addition brings new moves and traits to use, so players can experiment with party builds some more. The Combat Inspect feature can be used at any time in battle so you can see exactly what buffs, debuffs, and conditions are active at any time. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>

</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Monster)</span><wbr></p>
<p>The balancing changes for this update are rather conservative, since the last set of balancing changes was rather recent. We mostly tried to target monsters, types, and skills that have been overperforming or underperforming for a long time.</p>
<p><wbr><b>Medusa</b><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the Signature Trait to trigger for every 5 debuffs cleansed (from 6) and deal 1 x 5 damage (from 1 x 6)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Naga</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the Signature Trait (unshifted) to deal 2 x 4 damage (instead of 2 x 2)<wbr></li>
<li>Increased 2nd Worthiness Perk (unshifted + shifted) to Shield Generator +3 (from +2)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Djinn</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Worthiness perk (unshifted + shifted) increased to Evasion +20% (from 15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Shifted Djnn’s health reduced to 30 (from 35); matching the unshifted value<wbr></li>
<li>Signature Trait (unshifted) was adjusted to grant +35% Crit Chance (form +30% Crit Chance)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Types)</span><wbr></p>
<p><b>Critical</b><wbr></p>
<p>We decided to give a soft rework to the Critical type with this update. We removed the few skills that apply Force (instead moving them to the Force type). To make up for that, Critical now has easy access to skills that apply Bleed stacks. Bleed stacks open up more potential for synergies for the Critical type itself, as well as for Maverick skills with other types. We think this is a more interesting direction for the Critical type and also helps to distinguish the Critical type from the Force type. We also made some further buffs and reworked some non-aura skills into auras. Please also take note of the new skills we added to support this rework (listed above)!<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Force (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Fire Blast (Action): Crit Chance increased to +30% (from +25%)<wbr></li>
<li>Stone Edge (Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 8 (from 3 x 9). Added: “On Crit: Applies 1 Bleed.”<wbr></li>
<li>Critical Bleed (Maverick Trait): Changed into a regular Critical Trait (no longer requires Affliction type in the party, is no longer a Maverick Trait)<wbr></li>
<li>Cruelty (Trait): Reworked into a Force + Power Maverick Trait: “At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force and&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;temporary Power to self.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect (as a regular Critical Trait): “Crit Damage +3. At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force to self.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical Hybridization (Trait): Reworked into an aura: “Aura: On Crit from an ally: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “On Crit: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assault Shield (Maverick Trait): Reworked into an aura: “On Crit from an ally: Shields them for 3.”<wbr>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Old effect: “This monster’s Sidekick Attack is always critical.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Force</b><wbr></p>
<p>Apart from the Critical rework, the most drastic set of changes are aimed at the Force type, which has been underperforming for a long time. These changes are meant to help promote the intended Force strategy of using Support Actions to build up Force stacks.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Petal Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Air Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 3 (from 2), but Shielding per Force stack reduced to 2 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Damage increased to 1 x 18 (from 1 x 15)<wbr></li>
<li>Into the Fray (Trait): Adjusted to apply 1 Force to each ally (instead of applying 1 Force to target ally and 1 Force to self)<wbr></li>
<li>Reinforce (Trait): Reduced the healing to 3 (from 5) and increased the Force applied to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Fierce Summoning (Maverick Trait): Also Shields the attached monster for 3 when it triggers<wbr></li>
<li>Massive Damage (Maverick Trait): Health required per +1 Crit Damage adjusted to 15 (from 20)<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Terror</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Chill (Action): Terror stacks applied increased to 5 (from 4)<wbr></li>
<li>Panic (Trait): Terror stacks applied increased to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Nighmare (Trait): The damage hits now ignore retaliates<wbr></li>
<li>Dark Exchange (Maverick Trait): Debuffs cleansed (and transferred) increased to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Frightful Lightning: Applies 3 Terror to each enemy (instead of 3 Terror to each other enemy)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Summon</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>New equipment affix: “Essence Summoning +1” (Minions summoned by this monster gain +1 Essence). Requires “Summon” type in the party to be obtained.<wbr></li>
<li>Protective Servitude (Trait): Increased healing and shielding to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Summon Mastery (Trait): Increased Minion Damage to +2 (from +1). Removed the aura tag.<wbr></li>
<li>Impactful Summoning (Trait): Increased the damage to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Totem Summons: Changed to apply 4 heal + 4 shield (instead of only doing 6 shield)<wbr></li>
<li>Faun: Heal changed to 2 x 3 (from 3x 2) (This was always meant to be 2 x 3, but was set up wrongly)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Shock (Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Split Aether (Maverick Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Wildflower Harvest (Maverick Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 4 (from 3 x 5)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weakness</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Hexing Strikes (Trait): No longer has Weakness Reduction +1<wbr></li>
<li>Warlock Party (Trait): Now also has Weakness Reduction +1, but only applies 1 Weakness to the enemy with the lowest amount of Weakness (instead of 2 Weakness distributed to up to 2 enemies with the lowest amount of Weakness)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Dodge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eye of the Storm: Required damage adjusted to 35 (from 30)<wbr></p>
