		<p>During Future Games Show LATAM, Run Games announced and shadow dropped a new free to play multiplayer football game called Football Heroes League. It seems to be inspired by Rocket League but with actual football instead of cars. We have essentially come full circle and can dub this Rocket League with people.</p>

<p>In Football Heroes League, you can compete in 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 matches to score the most goals and win. There is also a training mode to get to grips with the controls, and an instant replay system will be added soon. Players can currently choose from a roster of five heroes, with more to be added during the game’s early access phase. The five heroes available at the moment are Kenzo, Beckers, Leo, Frostine, and Bun-E, and each of them has a special ability. Kenzo has jet boots to give him super speed, Beckers has mag boots to control the ball direction so she can in theory bend it like Beckham, Leo has the strength to get passed opponents, Frostine is able to freeze opponents, and Bun-E commands BunBots that can be used to assist in defence and attack. I bet VAR wouldn’t be able to cope with all of these shenanigans.</p>

		<p>Developer Killasoft has revealed The Shadow Syndicate which has been described as a stealth action game set in 1930’s Brooklyn. You can check out the reveal trailer below from Future Games Show LATAM, with the footage giving a look at some gameplay and the noir kind of feel that you would expect from a detective game set in the 1930s.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Shadow Syndicate - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcxW7qOesd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Shadow Syndicate’s description says,<em> “The Shadow Syndicate is a narrative-driven stealth-action game set in a stylized 1930s Brooklyn. Step into the shoes of Sam Marlowe, a retired soldier turned private detective, as he unravels a city-wide conspiracy involving secret societies, occult forces, and a creeping darkness threatening to consume it all. Sneak, fight, and investigate through a rich cinematic experience blending noir storytelling with supernatural abilities and fast-paced action. Use your cursed Sacrifice Ring to unleash powerful skills—at a cost. Explore a living open city between missions, filled with colorful characters, mini-games, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.”</em></p>
<p>The gameplay will consist of investigating areas for clues, solving puzzles in your notebook, interrogating characters for information, and getting into gunfights. The combat will feature bullet time as well as supernatural abilities that will let Sam stun enemies, teleport, or instantly kill enemies. However, using these abilities builds up a deadly curse that will have consequences for Sam. Outside of the main story you take on side quests or you can go around Brooklyn to go bowling, play darts, or play blackjack.</p>

<p>A release date for The Shadow Syndicate is yet to be confirmed but it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has released 10 minutes of footage for Elden Ring Nightreign, with this video’s aim being to give an overview of the game’s systems and characters. It goes over the world of Limveld, the characters you can choose from, and the new systems players will have to get to grips with that were not present in Elden Ring.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Limveld is not going to be a simple place to traverse. It is filled with powerful enemies, bases filled with soldiers, and random events that can change everything. Players can explore together in groups of three or choose to split up and cover more ground alone to learn the secrets of the land. There are dungeons filled with gear and treasure, while bases can hold information that will reveal more to you about the world. Do not expect the world to be static while you explore though. Every expedition sees the layout of Limveld change, with the landscape subject to change at a moment’s notice due to meteor strikes, lava eruptions, and the appearance of forests. At night, the play area gets smaller and smaller until you are cornered in to a small space where very powerful enemies stir. These battles are unavoidable so you need to spend the day maximising your exploration to level up and get the best gear.</p>
<p>In Elden Ring you could customise your character in a number of ways, but in Nightreign you choose from one of six heroes to play as. Raider is for those of you who like to wield big and powerful weapons, while Ironeye is an archer who can hit from range. Wylder is a character that is adept at all skills but master of none, perfect for those who don’t want to get locked into a specific way of play but it will take some time to master the skills he possesses. Guardian is a tank character that is able to withstand all kinds of attacks, including the most dangerous. Recluse wields cursed magic to attack her enemies, and Duchess is a character adept at dodging and striking quickly. Each character has their own story and their true identities will slowly be revealed as memory fragments are uncovered, which in turn will lead to new objectives to tackle.</p>
<p>When not out in the field fighting enemies, players can find some respite at the Roundtable Hold. The Roundtable Hold is where players can equip relics, with these having various effects on players from increasing stats to changing the impact of skills. You can also buy different items at the Roundtable Hold from a Jar mechant. There is also an area where new costumes can be unlocked using the game currency to change the appearance of your character.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on 30th May.</p>
