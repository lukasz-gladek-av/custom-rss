		<p>It’s a good time to be a Monster Hunter fan, what with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> coming on 28th February… but what if you want to play sooner? Well, Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has good news for you, announcing that Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 is also coming in February!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?start=12&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 will take place across two weekends, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, with crossplay enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekend 1</strong> – Thursday 6th February 7PM PT through Sunday 9th February 6:59PM PT</li>
<li><strong>Weekend 2</strong> – Thursday 13th February 7PM PT through Sunday 16th February 6:59PM PT</li>
</ul>
<p>That translates to a 3AM start time on Friday mornings in the UK.</p>
<p>Open Beta Test 2 will expand on the first beta test with some additional monsters for you to take on. In addition to the full character creation suite, the story trial and the slay Doshaguma quest, you’ll also be able to hunt Gypceros.</p>

<p>You can carry forward your characters created for the first beta test, and that can also be transferred to the full game, though game progress is not transferring. If you do take part in the beta, you’ll also get a cute little charm for your weapon or Seikret.</p>
<p>The development team does warn that outside of content this will not be a significant shift when compared to the first beta. This includes adjustments to performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more that will only be made for the full game. Capcom detailed the changes being made in a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/monster-hunter-wilds-pre-launch-update-addresses-open-beta-issues/">community update</a> back in December.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game last year, sharing impressions in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>. Nic said, “Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say — I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.”</p>
