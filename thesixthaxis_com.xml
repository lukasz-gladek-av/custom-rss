		<p>The Sims Mobile is no longer playable as EA has turned off the servers for the game, having removed it from the Google Play Store and App Store back in October, along with monetary purchases. It had been a pretty long running game, having launched in March 2018 receiving regular content updates right through to October 2025.</p>
<p>On January 6th 2026, EA had made build mode and create a sim items free, having told players to spend any in game currency before that date as there would be no monetary refunds for unspent currency. Unlocking everything meant those who still had the game installed could try out everything in the game without restriction.</p>


<p>As The Sims Mobile requires an internet connection there is no way to play the game going forward, unless EA decides to suddenly resurrect it. When the announcement was made in relation to The Sims Mobile’s shut down the development team said, <em>“Thank you for making&nbsp;The Sims Mobile such a creative, kind, and imaginative community over the past seven years. We’ve loved seeing everything the community has created, and we hope this final chapter helps complete everything you have planned and more before we say goodbye.”</em></p>

		<p>Developer Kenny Sun has announced that Ball X Pit’s first free major update is launching on January 26th. The Regal Update will add two new treasure seekers, eight new balls, and new passives too. You can get a glimpse of the action in the video below. The two new seekers are the Carouser and the Falconer. The Carouser has returning balls orbiting around him, while the Falconeer has two falcons that throw balls. Ball X Pit players will also get an additional surprise, though no details have been revealed.</p>

<p>In our Ball X Pit review, Dom said,&nbsp;<em>“Ball X Pit carries the spirit of an arcade classic, while imbuing it with modern roguelike ideas. It’s immediately one of the best indie games of the year.”</em></p>
