		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000, leaping from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/total-war-warhammer-3-review/">Warhammer Fantasy</a> setting to the grimdark future and galactic warfare.</p>
<p>A release date has not been given, but the game is in development for PC as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/total-war-medieval-iii-announced-at-series-25th-anniversary-total-war-engine-gets-ready-for-console-gaming/">as was teased at the 25th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER 40,000 - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVgCDqLTaJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the brief snippets of gameplay hint at, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will actually look to adapt the war for the galaxy and planets as opposed to settlements and cities – a more thematic, but no less significant change for the feel of the game.</p>
<p>You’ll still have the same empire expansion gameplay here, capturing planets, upgrading your fleet and having a war economy to feed further growth. Sieges become orbital bombardments, assaulting the walls of the castle becomes sending in the drop pods and landing and army. And if you need to, there’s always planet-killing weapons.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Four factions will be playable to start with – Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and the Astra Militarum (AKA the Imperial Guard) – and you’ll have the ability to customise your troops, choosing colours, emblazening uniforms and armour with particular iconography and also affecting their gameplay style. Change a combat philogophy, arm them with tactical abilities, signature traits and arcane wargear.</span></p>
<p>Game director Attila Mohacsi said</p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">“Hi everyone!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to finally share this with you: Total War is heading into the Warhammer 40,000 universe! For so many of us on the team, this isn’t just another project. It’s a dream come true. We spent years imagining what Total War could look like in the grim darkness of the far future, and now we’re in the process of making it a reality.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">A lot of us are lifelong Warhammer 40,000 fans, so this is personal. We want to do justice to the scale, the drama and the sheer intensity of this universe while staying true to what makes Total War special. It’s the start of a brand-new chapter for the franchise, and we couldn’t be more excited to go on this galactic journey with you.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">We’ll have more to share, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.”</span></em></p>
<p>So… whaddya think? For more details, the studio will be hosting a round table discussion for broad strokes about this game’s development and direction.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly are going to be busy with developing Total War 40K as well as Total War: Medieval 3 (as was announced last week) and building their game engine to better handle consoles.</p>
