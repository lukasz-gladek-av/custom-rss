		<p>Shin’en has released the launch trailer for their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive anti-gravity racing sequel, Fast Fusion. The game is a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, coming out on 5th June alongside the new generation console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fast Fusion Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Shin’en’s Fast series has become a staple of Nintendo’s consoles, debuting on Wii in 2011 with Fast Racing League, before Fast Fusion Neo on Wii U, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a> remixed that game for the Switch’s launch, Fast Fusion is a brand new entry.</p>
<p>It looks to be a real technical showcase, with gorgeous, realistic looking environments and fast racing through them. The game will run at up to 4K and 60fps on the Switch 2, and support HDR as well. Heck, there’s even four-player local split-screen. The game will also adopt the GameShare and GameChat feature for two players to share one copy of the game for multiplayer, both locally and online.</p>
<p>The key trick for the game is that you can now fuse together vehicles, blending their visuals, stats and creating hundreds of possible combinations.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a> in 2017, I said, “Fast RMX is practically a must buy, but it’s a purist take on the genre and damn difficult without many, if any of the bells and whistles of other racers. That said, if you’re looking to scratch a certain F-Zero or Wipeout itch on Switch it’s absolutely worth a look.”</p>

			<p>Watching Rogue Factor’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-is-us">Hell Is Us</a> in action is like video game clickbait. At first glance it’s a dark and depressing modern war story, but suddenly there are white art-deco style creatures rising from the ground, huge balls of spinning time, and melee combat rather than guns. It invites investigation and that is a key element to the game, as there are no way points or quest markers; you need to use your instincts to work you way across the landscape and find out what exactly what is happening.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Is Us - Official Gameplay Trailer | State of Play 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMcqTSPjEak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in the fictional country of Hadea you play as Rémi, a native Hadean who moved out of the country when he was very young, leaving his family behind. Now a member of a United Nations-style peacekeeping force, he returns to his war ravaged home country in the 1990s and promptly goes AWOL so he can search for his parents. He is very much on his own, wandering through the country trying to piece together three overlapping stories: What happened to his family, what happened in the war, and what is the ‘Calamity’, the event that has caused the supernatural creatures to appear.</p>


<p>These creatures take strange humanoid forms that will attack you if you get to close, but they can have more dangerous forms. Get too close to one and a ball of glitching mass will spew from the creature and attack you as a secondary drone which needs to be defeated before trying to kill the creature itself. These extra nodes are colour-coded to specific emotions – red for rage, green for terror, yellow for ecstasy and blue for grief – with each emotion having a specific attack style.</p>


<p>While the game may look like an open-world Soulslike, it isn’t. Or at least, it’s not totally. Combat uses melee weapons made of a special Lymbic material as conventional firearms cannot harm the creatures. So you’ve got to resort to the swords, axes, poleaxes and other low-tech weapons that are available, each with their own strengths and weakness. You will need to use the block and dodge button effectively, running in and hacking away will lead to certain death, but chaining hits will gradually increase the damage from some weapons. You also have a stamina and health bar, attacking and dodging will use stamina which will eventually recover, but health does not and death will send you all the way back to your last save point.</p>
<p>You also have a drone, KAPI, and you might be thinking that would be used for extra firepower, and you’d be right, but not in the way you would expect. As conventional weapons do not hurt the enemies it would be pointless giving KAPI a gun, so it instead attaches itself to Rémi to power him up for special moves, such as a whirlwind of blades or an extra strong forward stab.</p>
<p>Now, I am not the biggest fan of Soulslike combat, but after unlocking a few special moves and power ups I really began to enjoy the core fighting loop, chaining together attacks and special moves soon becoming second nature. The development team are keen to stress that this game isn’t a hardcore battler like Elden Ring, and is maybe more of a “Souls-lite”. Think of a middle ground between modern <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/">God of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/03/30/bloodborne-review/">Bloodborne</a> and you’d be close; you can still do hacking and slashing, but carefully.</p>

<p>For my hands-on preview I played a large open world section near the start of the game and, after walking past a disturbing pile of corpses and a crying woman, a large marshland area was revealed with plenty of landmarks spread across it that invited investigation. The main task is to discover what happened to your father, the blacksmith in the village, but there are many other characters to talk to and pick up information and side quests. It’s worth talking to everyone you can as they may just reveal a small detail that sends you in a completely new direction, although many of them are wary of strangers. You also may also need to return to characters as moving the story forward will unlock new dialogue options.</p>
<p>Rémi’s village, Jova, is occupied by one of the forces in the civil war, so he must be careful with what he says and who he talks to. Suffice to say, Dad is no longer there and you are given directions as where he might have gone. I decided to ignore the main quest and have a wander around the rest of the map, uncovering more information on the war, the Calamity and an Abbey which I could not access due to soldiers barring the way. A little more wandering and an audio clue led me to a new character, who in turn unlocked the trainee blacksmith back at the village, who had more news on good old Dad and also allowed me to upgrade my weapons.</p>
<p>While there are no quest markers to direct you, you do have a handy digital device that keeps track of who you met and what they want, along with any significant details that will help you find what you are looking for.&nbsp; You can also access your inventory here and assign weapons and consumables and read any documents you have discovered. From the four hours I have played it does seem the world is packed with things to do and discover and you may want to have a notepad by your side to remind you of everything you are investigating.</p>

<p>I also played a section from later in the game, a water-filled dungeon packed full of enemies and contraptions. You have to unlock mechanisms that drain out the water, gradually revealing more and more of the dungeon. This section felt a little more guided as, while there are no clues what to do or where to go, your options are limited by locked doors or pools of water, and the obvious destination would usually have a key or mechanism for unlocking the next part of the dungeon. Oh, and there’s the obligatory boss battle at the end.</p>
<p>I think the most alluring part of Hell Is Us is the unknown.&nbsp; It has the feel of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">Death Stranding</a> where clearly something very odd is going on, but you have no idea what. Clearly there’s a link to the war and the creatures powered by emotions, but what has your family got to do with it? I have no idea how the story will unfold but Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête has said “The central theme of Hell is Us is that human violence is a perpetual cycle fuelled by human emotions and passions.”</p>

<p>I really enjoyed playing Hell Is Us, and from my hands-on time it could turn out to be something very special. I can’t wait for the final game, set to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-for-september/">release on September 4th, 2025</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><em>Hell is Us will also be part of the June Steam Next Fest and the game’s demo (with about 1.5 hours of play time) will be live ahead of time, from Monday, 2nd June at 3 PM BST / 4 PM CEST.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/scar-lead-salvation-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Scar-Lead Salvation can be succinctly summed up as PS5 classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/">Returnal</a> with an Anime aesthetic. It’s a third-person action-adventure roguelike, then, and one that sees its heroine battle through waves of robots to recover her memory and escape the mysterious factory she finds herself trapped within. Unfortunately, there’s also another way to describe Scar-Lead Salvation: a torrid, unfinished mess.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scar-Lead Salvation | Boss Trailer | PS4®, PS5®, Steam®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtMmL3AOs9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things start off promisingly enough. Your amnesiac avatar certainly looks cool, decked out in chunky armour and with that distinct anime visual style imbuing her with bucket loads of charm. She moves well too, smoothly darting around each enclosed area, blasting away with a multitude of weapons as she goes. In a neat touch, her armour is damaged and falls away as she’s injured, giving you a nice visual signifier of how close you are to death.</p>


<p>Initially, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there was nothing wrong with the game. Our hero shoots some bland looking robots, causing them to explode in a satisfactory manner. The floating big robo balls and giant can machines she faces spew out patterns of pulsing laser blasts, forcing the player to dodge and parry through the bullet hell. Once you are victorious you move on through an interconnecting corridor to a new room to do it all again.</p>
<p>Things become concerning when nothing changes. You face the same floating big robo balls and giant can machines again and again. Sure, a turret might get added, but you are ostensibly fighting the same handful of enemies, with boredom soon setting in. Worse, your foes are dumb as under-achieving bricks, mostly doing nothing until you attack. They don’t try to flank the player, pursue them, overwhelm them, or do anything interesting at all really, they just politely wait until you start shooting them.</p>


<p>Now, with most roguelikes, after clearing an area you get a choice of doors, usually with an indication of a certain type of enemy you’ll face or a specific reward you might earn for picking that path. Not so in Scar-Lead Salvation, as while there are always three doors leading out of every arena, two of them are inexplicably locked. I thought, at some point, as the game opens up, surely these doors will become accessible? Nope, this is a roguelike with a strictly linear path, leading to an incredibly tedious gameplay loop without a hint of self-determination. Worse, despite the basic visuals and bland environments, the game insists you run along a dull identical series of corridors to reach the next area, presumably to give it time to load up the encounter. As you careen along the next corridor, there’s some turgid banter between our protagonist and the AI voice that is guiding her. I wouldn’t bother trying to pay much attention; both characters are snarky, whiny, and deeply unlikeable.</p>
<p>The gameplay is so very boring. Partly because the game is insanely easy, outside of a scripted moment. I just didn’t die, which is kind of the whole point of a roguelike. But also, because every arena is the same grey shoe box shaped space with a slightly different configuration of walls, I became increasingly glassy-eyed, blasting away at more identical robo cans, but then I had an epiphany. The door out of the arena isn’t even locked.</p>
<p>That’s right, you don’t actually need to fight the enemies, you can just run straight through to the next corridor. Now, you’d be forgiven for thinking that would be a bad idea as, without killing enemies, how will you level up and receive powerful new abilities? Well, by collecting the new weapons and power ups in one of the reward rooms that pepper your journey – though, you don’t really need to bother choosing a new weapon, as the basic machine gun you get at the start is by far the best and will see you to the end.</p>

<p>In fact, so dull has the combat become, I elected to just run through each room, avoiding the robo cans and – in a new enemy type shocker – some drone thingies, until I reached the bosses. The bosses are rubbish too, there’s no tactics or strategy required, no attack patterns to overcome, just strafe and shoot for ten minutes and you’ll win. Shockingly, the frame rate drops at these points, resulting in lags and pauses that are just embarrassing considering the two or three polygons being thrown around on screen.</p>
<p>From the second boss onwards, the frame rate really gets choppy, even on PS5, but, fear not, because after a few hours or more of struggling through this drudgery, Scar-Lead Salvation comes to a welcome conclusion. And that’s the end of that.</p>
