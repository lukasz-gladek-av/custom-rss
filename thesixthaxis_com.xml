<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li>TSBonyman checked in with an update of his gaming antics, having run through plenty more No Man’s Sky with the custom ship designing, a cheap copy of Atomic Heart which impressed with its style, but less so its gameplay, and the System Shock remake for some classic immersive sim action. He’s also enjoyed&nbsp;Steamworld Dig 2 and Steamworld Heist, which are still lovely indie games.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>
