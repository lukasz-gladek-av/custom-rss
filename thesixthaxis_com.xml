		<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition was supported with no less than eight DLC packs but you will not be getting a single one for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The news was confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone who say Bioware have now moved all their staff on to working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series. The game is currently sitting at ratings of 70 for the PC version, 84 for the PS5 version, and 93 for the Xbox version over on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Metacritic,</a> our review is still in progress.</p>


<p>The next Mass Effect title was teased back on N7 Day, 7th November 2022, when Bioware said “Pre-production development has been proceeding very well. The team, comprised of Mass Effect franchise veterans as well as some amazing new additions to BioWare™, has grown steadily! They’ve been hard at work crafting new characters and locations that you’ll love, as well as revisiting many that you’ll remember.”</p>
<p>The game is set to follow on the from the original trilogy and will be a single player game.&nbsp; In the interview with Rolling Stone veteran Bioware creative director John Epler notes that while he likes multiplayer games, they are very hard to make.</p>
<p>“It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game.<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV </em>does an excellent job,” he said. “Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world, and the world changes.” For games like <em>Dragon Age</em>, the consequences of a player’s choice are intended to impact the narrative moving forward, but for a multiplayer game, it isn’t quite as simple. For example, one player could choose to save a certain person from their fate while another could do the opposite.”</p>


<p>“It’s funny, because the games I play the most on my personal time are actually multiplayer games,” he says. “But when it comes to crafting these worlds and crafting the experiences, I love the focus that single-player can give you.”</p>
<p>With N7 day just round the corner, maybe we will get an update then.</p>
