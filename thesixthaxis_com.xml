		<p>There’s a packed year of updates and new content coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> with its 2025 roadmap, starting with the Chronicle update, and extending to new maps, various map, character and event reworks, and more.</p>
<p>Alongside the roadmap reveal, Kinetic Games also announced that the game has passed 2 million sales on consoles, and over 22 million sales across all platforms. That’s great going!</p>



<p>The first major update of the year will be Chronicle, which was previewed at the end of 2024. This update will overhaul how evidence is collected, with a new Media tab that will gather together all the photos and videos you’ve collected, as well as audio recordings from the new Sound Recorder tool.</p>
<p>The second update in 2025 will the bring a player character overhaul, refreshing the character models, improving the animations, but stopping short of full player customisation, which will now come in 2026. That will allow the team to focus on the Horror 2.0 update that is also expected in 2026.</p>

<p>But there’s plenty more for 2025 still. A brand new map will be added, and there will be updated version of Bleasdale Farmhouse (arriving in March), Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. The first of which, Bleasdale, will be releasing in March. each will have a complete artistic overhaul, new assets, new animations and a few layout changes to refresh how hunts progress.</p>
<p>Seasonal Events are also getting a bit of an overhaul for 2025, taking the first iteration of these from 2024 and adapting them to player feedback. There will be events for Easter, Halloween and Winter. While the actual event modifiers and goals will be similar, there will be personal rewards, wider map rotations, and more.</p>
<p>We had a great time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/28/phasmophobia-early-access-console-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">exploring Phasmophobia for its console launch</a>, saying, “There’s a bunch of rough edges from adapting the controls to gamepad, and from that initial learning curve, but Phasmophobia is absolutely that kind of game – grab a few friends, go to a spooky house, and run around in the dark calling out to “Susan” or whatever their name was. You’ll have a hell of a time while you do.”</p>
