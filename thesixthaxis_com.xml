		<p>The narrative prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter,</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is set to launch into Steam Early Access on 14th January 2025.</p>

<p>Set decades before the acclaimed action adventure RPG, Hyper Light Breaker is making a pretty clean break(er) in terms of genre, even if it retains a lot of the visual traits of the original. This is now a 3D co-op roguelite where players will head into the Overgrowth and explore its procedurally generated worlds and challenges, looking to uncover the truth of the Crowns, the Abyss King and the eerie landscape in general.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t going to be the full game, with developer Heart Machine having plenty planned for the journey through Early Access. There will be new Breakers characters, Crowns bosses, gear, and more on the to-do list. They will also naturally be listening to the community feedback to help balance the experience and shape certain parts of it as it heads toward a 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>In our Hyper Light Drifter review, Miguel wrote, <em>“Hyper Light Drifter is a jaw-dropping experience no matter the platform you play it on. What started as an engaging masterpiece in 2016 continues to be just as rewarding and worthwhile of a video game in 2018. With the Nintendo Switch you get the valuable bonus of being able to take this journey with you anywhere you want and believe me when I say this is a journey you will not want to step away from once you start it.”</em></p>

		<p>TankHead has a release date and that release date is… today! That’s right, the thoroughly unusual tank combat, survival and scavenging game TankHead is out now, exclusively on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="TankHead - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyZo9AC0bsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TankHead takes place in an apocalyptic setting where the war-torn world of ECA has become almost entirely uninhabitable. It’s because of this that Whitaker needs to tele-project his consciousness into a Needle drone that can survive the harsh environment. Also pilot a tank. That’s also quite important.</p>
<p>Heading into the wasteland, you’ll need a tank, but you’ll have to scavenge and cobble it together from parts. collecting new weapons, wheels, armour, spare parts, engines and more to improve your vehicle.</p>
<p>Because of the scrappily put together tanks you have, you’ll need a tactical approach to combatting the enemy tanks you face, always trying to present your strongest side – you have separate control of the tank’s direction and the turret – evade incoming fire as much as possible and chip away at their armour to reveal weak points to target.</p>

<p>The better and cleaner the vicoty, the more valuable the loot you can recover from the burning carcass of your fallen foes, grabbing replacement parts and upgrades for your tank.</p>
<p>It all culminates in battles against truly bizarre boss tanks, which in the trailer seems to include a very angry walking hotel or river boat?</p>

		<p>Veewo Games has revealed Neon Abyss 2, a sequel to their hit run ‘n’ gun roguelike from 2020. Neon Abyss 2 is heading to Steam Early Access in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Neon Abyss 2 aims to take everything that was great about the original and amp it up to 11. There’s a wild range of weapons, from deadly plants to dragon-like creatures, all of which will shift your combat style in tandem with synergistic power-ups that you will combine and evolve through each run. You can also still hatch and train new companions, evolving them into allies that will fight alongside you.</p>
<p>And there’s now a Faith system that can be used to power up, recruit allies, or gamble away.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course there’s still minigames, with the trailer wrapping up with a little bit of basketball.</p>
