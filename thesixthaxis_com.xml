		<p>What a hectic week this has been at TSA Towers! There’s been three separate events on the go, and I’ve travelled to Krakow to take part in Digital Dragons, a celebration of the Polish games industry. While I was there, I played an absolute bucketload of stuff – seriously, the games were sloshing out of my pail. I’ve already started to tell you about them, and they include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/vales-echo-is-a-dark-gothic-foray-into-the-cosy-horror-genre/">Vale’s Echo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/war-mechanic-weaves-an-intriguing-alternate-history-where-ww2-never-ended/">War Mechanic</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school/">XYZ – Tear Them Down</a>, all of which showcased the talent nestling in Poland’s borders. Alongside that, I’ve finished off playing the excellent Roadcraft, and I’m ready for more vehicular action with F1 25 this weekend.</p>
<p>From the team, we’ll start the week with <strong>Aran</strong>, who played and rather enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/blades-of-fire-review/">Blades of Fire</a>, where he got to play as himself, Aran de Lira. It loosely falls into that Soulslike bracket, but the action RPG combat is mixed together with a fun weapon forging system where you do some pretty literal blacksmithing, and there’s a really nice, supportive relationship between the game’s two leads. Definitely <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/a-blades-of-fire-demo-drops-tomorrow-with-saves-carrying-over-to-the-full-game/">check out the demo</a> if you’re curious about it.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played something that&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> Destiny 2 this week, hopping onto a very slow Eurostar to Paris to go hands on with RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business and Hell Is Us… and that’s all he’s allowed to say about that right now, but keep your eyes peeled if you enjoy cyborg cops and mysterious Soulslikes.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Oblivion and Split Fiction this week, but his strong recommendations led to <strong>Ade</strong> playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. “From the first few hours onwards I’ve been totally hooked, it’s an absolutely brilliant game. And that ending to chapter 1… Oh, wow!” He was also enticed to play Revenge of the Savage Planet from Dom’s review, saying, “it’s a terrifically fun and delightfully silly game, and the very good local co-op option is helping to fill the Split Fiction shaped hole in our lives.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> is still taking his time with Doom: The Dark Ages, doing just one level each day. He did manage to finally mop up the 100% in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, “which is a huge relief after it became a chore by the end.” The weekend ahead has him looking forward to diving into a ton of indie games from the Endix indie game convention.</p>
<p>Also still on the Doom train is <strong>Miguel</strong>, who played some of that and a bit more of Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy. He’s also been getting back into Synduality: Echoes of Ada with Season 2 starting today, a bit of the cutesy co-op bunny farming game Cinnabun, and a random replay of Metal Gear Solid V.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> played his very first Civilization game with… Civ 6, because that one’s much cheaper than Civ 7 right now. “I can definitely see why Civ has a reputation as a “just one more turn” kind of game though, as with the Total War series, I find that engaging in the diplomacy system is boring and yields little benefit compared to being a brutal conqueror.”</p>

<p>And after that cheerful note, <strong>Tef</strong> rounds out this week having played a good chunk of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-review/">Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker</a>, the free DLC for the rather great RPG. And he’s also been hands on with a trio of Sega’s upcoming Switch 2 games, with a solid port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/">Yakuza 0</a> getting a barmy multiplayer mode, the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/raidou-remastered-preview/">Raidou remake</a>, and then a frankly very odd <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/is-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s-better-with-joy-con-2-mouse-controls/">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> re-release where the main addition is some wonky mouse controls. So… that’s nice?</p>
<p><em>Anyway, what have </em>you<em> been playing this week? Let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

		<p>It’s Friday! And there’s exciting news! <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">Elden Ring</a> remains one of the biggest games of all time, its Soulslike action crafted and honed by FromSoftware, who have got pretty good at the whole thing, having created the Souls genre in the first place. As one of the biggest games of all time, it’s little surprise to find that someone has eventually decided to turn Elden Ring into a movie, with Alex Garland – known for writing hit films like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, before moving into directing with titles like Ex Machina and Civil War – at the helm.</p>
<p>While this is undoubtedly exciting news, it does raise a few questions. While Alex Garland undoubtedly has the chops to craft a fantastical and emotionally resonant story, and to then bring it to fruition from the director’s chair, this will be his first true foray into the fantasy genre, previously having specialised in science fiction. It’s not his first brush with gaming though, as he co-wrote the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/11/review-enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Journey to the West</a>, a sci-fi take on the classic Monkey mythology, as well as serving as a story supervisor for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/01/14/dmc-devil-may-cry-review-ps3-xbox-360/">DMC: Devil May Cry</a>.</p>


<p>Elden Ring was created under the guidance of FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki, based on a mythological story written by George R. R. Martin, author of the fantasy novel series, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” That’s Game of Thrones if you’ve been living under a rock. The game has sold an astonishing 30 million copies worldwide, and we’re just about to witness the launch of a new entry in the series with Elden Ring: Nightreign due to launch on the 30th of May.</p>
<p>Elden Ring’s dark and menacing world of brutal challenges is undoubtedly an evocative setting, and, if done well, could be a fantasy epic to rival Lord of the Rings, or Martin’s own Game of Thrones. We’re definitely intrigued, and we can’t wait to find out more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/warhammer-40000-darktide-adds-the-brutal-arbites-class-this-june/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been a great week if you’re a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe and its digital interpretations, with the yearly Skulls event dropping a load of Games Workshop-related information on us. You’ve got to love the return of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, or a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/">remaster of the original Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a>, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> players haven’t been left out in the cold, with the announcement of the all-new Arbites class joining the roster next month on the 23rd of June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZ176VVTJZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s fair to say that the Arbites are not messing around. They’re the brutal law enforcers of the Imperium – think Judge Dredd, with fewer hangups – and not only do they get to handle some tasty weaponry, they also have a dog. It’s not one you’re going to want to pet mind you, at least not if you want to keep your arm, as this cybernetic pooch is trained to chasedown and maim the Emperor’s enemies without hesitation. The CG trailer showcases that in visceral fashion, and, frankly, I can’t wait to try the new class out.</p>
<p>Originally launching in 2022 for Xbox and PC, before arriving on PS5 last year, Darktide is a multiplayer-focussed co-op shooter, where you’re tasked with bringing the Emperor’s light to the decidedly dark and dismal Hive City of Tertium. It’s an absolute blast, with action reminiscent of classic co-op shooters like Left 4 Dead, all set against the compelling backdrop of the grim Warhammer 40,000 universe.</p>
<p>We awarded the original version an excellent 8/10, saying, “Darktide is an absolute blast. Its heavyweight blend of melee and gunplay ensure that the flow of frantic runs into the hive city just keep on coming.”</p>

<p>The Arbites Class will arrive across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on the 23rd of June, priced at $11.99 / €11.99. Stay tuned to TSA for more as we have it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[XYZ Tear Them Down takes cyberpunk traversal to school]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school.1197183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>You can feel the adrenalin rush of XYZ Tear Them Down almost immediately. This first-person, low-poly cyberpunk title gives you the ability to alter gravity while handing you an energy sword. While that already sounds like everything you could possibly need, in action this is a fast, visceral slice of futurism that keeps you on the move, and constantly on the edge of your gaming chair.</p>
<p>We were able to go hands on with the game at Digital Dragons in Krakow, where, incidentally, it came second in the show’s indie game awards. That’s immediately a glowing recommendation from the Polish game industry, and one that, based on our time with it, is thoroughly well deserved.</p>
<p><iframe title="XYZ - DEMO OUT NOW TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MiHty-eH_CY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>XYZ is fast. The movement here is sublime, and you can race through levels at lightspeed if you have the reactions and chops to do so. Specific surfaces allow you to change the gravity, making the wall the floor and vice versa, and once you’ve got the hang of it, this is a game that flows.</p>
<p>These sections are what the team term as ‘running’ sections, distinct from the second type which is ‘arena’. Here you get to put that energy sword to use, swinging it with abandon into the metallic bodies of the robot drones that stand in your way.</p>

<p>You can also bounce their projectiles back at them with a well-timed swing, though you have to also aim it with your cursor which takes a little more practice to perfect.</p>

<p>Each arena zone has a large door with the remaining number of enemies to dispatch emblazoned on it, and so you have to search around, utilising the gravity changing mechanic to find where they are in the level. It’s clever stuff, and even here, in its unfinished state, the game has a distinct vision and purpose.</p>
<p>It looks great too. I’d like to see more interactivity with your environment – smashing vases is surely the nunber one feature to put into your game – but the low-poly look works incredibly well here, providing a look that’s basically timeless.</p>

<p>Clearly influenced by games like Ultrakill, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/">Neon White</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/26/ghostrunner-review-pc/">Ghostrunner</a>, speed and movement lie at the heart of XYZ. The team have absolutely nailed that aspect from the off.</p>
<p>What’s most impressive is that, not only is this their debut title, but they’ve also only just graduated from high school, which is astonishing. I can’t wait to see the finished article, and, on the strength of XYZ – Tear It Down this is a group of developers to keep an eye on.</p>
