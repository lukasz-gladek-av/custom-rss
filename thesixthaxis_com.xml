		<p>I do like to play co-op games. Luckily for me, there’s enough of us kicking around in TSA towers that we’re able to generally find someone of a similar mind to play a game with. If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably pretty used to the odd spot of co-op too, and that’s about to get better as today marks the launch of two of the greatest co-op puzzle adventures of all time, appearing for the first time for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Those games are the iconic We Were Here and We Were Here Too, the first two games in the We Were Here series. </p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here &amp; We Were Here Too Launch Trailer I Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUn4X9HajDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frankly, if you’ve got a co-op buddy to call on, I’d tell you to just go and pick them up now, but if not, then here’s a little context in order to get you interested. The We Were Here series has captivated players with its co-op puzzle designs and challenging duos to think outside the box since 2017, when We Were Here launched as a free game that has now been downloaded almost 10 million times. </p>
<p>Since then, the We Were Here series has been enjoyed by more than 20 million players. We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip is the latest release and it broke all previous records out of the water by hitting more than 8 million downloads within its first year. The puzzling adventures are playable in any order, although a common narrative thread runs through them.</p>
<p>Communication and lateral thinking are your two biggest weapons in the We Were Here series, and things are made all the more interesting by physically having to activate the in-game walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammate. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans on the way to solving each puzzle, and there’s just such a strong sense of identity and visual design that you can’t help but be drawn ever further into its idisyncratic world. </p>

<p>Players can pre-purchase the third entry of the series, We Were Here Together, on September 25 in the Nintendo eShop. A demo will then also be playable from September 25 to 28 at the Total Mayhem Games booth at Tokyo Game Show. The release of We Were Here Together will follow on October 9.</p>
<p>The We Were Here series, including We Were Here, We Were Here Too, and We Were Here Together, has also undergone significant enhancements. These include a visual overhaul, updated user interface, expanded settings, additional language translations, bug fixes, and cross-platform compatibility with PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. These updates are also making their way to other platforms, with full implementation expected by 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>﻿The We Were Here games will be fully compatible with Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2. A Nintendo Switch Online Membership and a headset with a microphone (or a different way to communicate with your partner) will be required to play the We Were Here Series on Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>
