		<p>Sony and Sucker Punch have released details for the Ghost of Yōtei collector’s edition, but it will not be cheap coming in $249.99/£219.99. If you do not fancy spending that much you will also have the options of the standard edition for £69.99 or the Digital Deluxe Edition for £79.99. You can see the details of Ghost of Yōtei following the trailer for the collector’s edition.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei is set a couple of centuries after Ghost of Tsushima, and introduces Atsu as the new protagonist.&nbsp; A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Ghost of Tsushima review, I said, ”&nbsp;“Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei is due to be released on October 2nd exclusively for PS5.</p>
