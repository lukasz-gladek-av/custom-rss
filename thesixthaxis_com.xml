		<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans will now be included as part of the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 base game, following strong criticism of the previous plans to have them be premium DLC and for pricier editions of the game. In their place two Story Packs will be created and launched in 2026 as part of an Expansion Pass available separately or with the Premium Edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> has a release date confirmed for 21st October 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>“Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing,” said Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer. “We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.”</p>
<p>This change now means that there will be six clans available to all players – the Banu Haqim, Brujah, Lasombra, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue – which are equivalent to character classes in other RPGs.</p>
<p>The two new stories are Loose Cannon, which will give players Brujah Sheriff Benny’s perspective and let them experience his story of relentless pursuit, set for Q2 2026, and <b><i>The Flower &amp; the Flame, which follows</i></b> Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s path to creating her dark magnum opus in Q3 2026.</p>

<p>Both story packs can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99, and there’s also Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack with decor items inspired by the original cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines to feature in Phyre’s in-game apartment for $11.99/£9.99/€11.99. They’re bundled into the $34.99/£28.99/€34.99 Expansion Pass or as part of the Premium Edition $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£58.50/€69.99) is now worse value, as they get the Santa Monica Memories included, but there doesn’t seem to be a cheaper Expansion Pass option for them.</p>
<p>Physical Day One and limited Premium Editions are to be released in collaboration with PLAION, including character cards, a journal, and a steelbook case.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 is a game that’s evoked plenty of strong opinions amongst fans of the 2004 original, and the Vampire: The Masquerade setting in general. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game.</p>
<p>Still set in Seattle, the narrative has shifted away from casting you as a freshly fledged vamp and you are instead Phyre, an Elder Vampire who is known for being a harbinger of tumult and sudden change. That, for some, detracts from the fantasy of the setting, even if you are still able to tap into the abilities of a clan of your choosing and role play through the world. At the same time, it could be more accessible as an entry point for those unfamiliar with the TTRPG or original game.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the opening couple hours of the game in the run up to Gamescom, and there’s an intriguing blend of characters, dire situations and powerful vampire types. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">Check out our preview here</a>.</p>
