		<p>Total Mayhem Games has announced the next entry into the We Were Here series with the reveal of We Were Here Tomorrow. We Were Here Tomorrow is its own standalone entry in the series, and does not have story links to the previous games. It also features two player online co-op so players can work together to explore the mysterious facility they find themselves in.</p>

<p>The description for We Were Here Tomorrow says, <em>“In this next standalone entry of the We Were Here series, you and your partner wake up inside a mysterious facility. Strange machinery surrounds you, and a calm, confident voice guides you through a series of assignments. Often separated and equipped with different tools, you’ll need to rely on your walkie-talkies to communicate clearly and work together. Each assignment introduces new asymmetrical puzzles that can only be solved through cooperation with your fellow explorer. As you progress, you’ll slowly uncover why you ended up here and what your role is within the facility. Only by working together can you decide the fate of Tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p>Aside from the two player co-op, We Were Here Tomorrow will also feature asymmetrical puzzles, the two characters having distinct roles and abilities, and a facility that has a retro-future design to it. We previously reviewed the last entry to the series <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/08/we-were-here-forever-review/">We Were Here Forever</a>, and in our review Stefan said, <em>“We Were Here Forever certainly grew on us the more we played, with some great brain-teasing puzzles that really make the most of the split player perspectives (though we did give up on the walkie-talkies).”</em></p>

<p>We Were Here Tomorrow is going to release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with an aim of releasing this year but a concrete date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Liquid Swords has confirmed that its upcoming open world action game &nbsp;Samson: A Tyndalston Story is going to release very soon. In fact, it is only around six weeks away with Samson’s release date confirmed as April 8th. This is for PC only with the game coming to Steam and Epic Games Store, with console versions to come at a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrkHPvMOBwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/">previous FAQ</a>, we know that the main story will take around 10 hours to complete, but experiencing everything the game has to offer could take around 25 hours. It will be priced at $24.99 and will be a purely single player experience, so no multiplayer and no microtransactions either. This will be a grounded title so don’t expect too much wackiness, with players having to deal with the consequences of every action they take as Samson. In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt.Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progress, Samson will be able to hone his fighting and driving skills, both of which are crucial to surviving and carrying out the jobs that are offered to him. Samson will have to deal with the criminal underworld of Tyndalston as well as law enforcement, which will become more aggressive if Samson keeps on committing crimes in their presence. The PC minimum specs have also been confirmed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>
</ul>
