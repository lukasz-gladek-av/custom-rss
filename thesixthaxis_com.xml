		<p>Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2 is kicking off with some new DLC on December 4th, with Stardock Entertainment announcing the Tales of the Terran Alliance content. This is just the first of five DLCs that will make up Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2, with more coming in 2026 and 2027.

<p><em>“This expansion is a love letter to&nbsp;Galactic Civilizations&nbsp;fans who have been asking for deeper human lore,”</em> said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment.<em> “Tales of the Terran Alliance delivers not just new gameplay mechanics, but a rich narrative experience that explores what it means to be human in a galaxy full of ancient, powerful civilizations.”</em></p>
<p>The Tales of the Terran Alliance DLC will put players in humanity’s shoes as it looks at an era where the human race was expanding through space. In the DLC you will be playing as the Xendar, get access to a new human technology tree, experience new narrative events that shape the journey of humanity, and get new weapons, planetary improvements, defenses, and more ship components. This DLC pack will cost $14.99, though the Expansion Pack 2 will offer a discount on the total price of all five packs.</p>
