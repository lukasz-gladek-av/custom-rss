<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Football Manager review, I wrote, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>
