		<p>Bungie has released a new ViDoc for their upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, confirming a new release window for the game, changes that have been made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">since the delay</a>, and setting a price.</p>
<p>Marathon will now launch in March 2026 for PS5 and PC, and it comes with a $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99 price tag.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon - Bungie ViDoc: Vision of Marathon | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4J91kh56jiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the game’s delay earlier this year, Bungie has been playtesting in private and gathering more feedback, making the following changes to the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity chat is now featured in the game</li>
<li>Rook is a new solo scavenger character type</li>
<li>Solo Runner queue</li>
<li>Updates to visual fidelity across the board</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really key changes, given the success and popularity of Arc Raiders. Proximity chat that enables collaboration with other players ad hoc has greatly shaped the gaming community within that extraction shooter, and having a solo queue has enabled distinct playstyles.&nbsp;The Rook character shell is specifically designed to enable you to join matches in progress, coming in with less gear but more potential to quickly scavenge and get out.</p>

<p>Also important is the change to the visuals, which will allow for dead runner bodies to remain in the world, adding a darker layer to the sci-fi visuals.</p>
<p>All of this is good (and so too is a price point that matched Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders), but we’ll have to wait and see if this helps the game come out from under the long shadow cast by its aborted announcement earlier this year. The game’s public testing and the reaction to this went so badly that Sony and Bungie had to pull back to avoid another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>-like disaster. Bungie has also been under pressure with Destiny 2, the company enduring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, and some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/15/bungie-finally-admit-they-messed-up-destiny-2-and-are-going-to-make-changes/">underwhelming reactions to the Edge of Fate</a> expansion this year, which they’ve finally admitted was a misstep and will work to rectify.</p>

		<p>Multiverse has revealed that its mashup colony sim and roguelite first person shooter Pax Autocratica will launch into early access on February 2nd. A new trailer has been released to confirm the news of the release, showing elements of the colony building and the first person shooter action. You can get a glimpse of Pax Autocratica below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AF-giWpYuk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>
<p>You might be wondering where the first person shooting comes into all of this. Well, you are not the only civisilation around. There are other regimes in the Tyris System and each one presents a danger. The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em> “1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

<p>Pax Autocratica has so far only been confirmed for PC.</p>
