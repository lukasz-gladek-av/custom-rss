		<p>Semblance developer Nyamakop has revealed Relooted, a heisting game that has ties back to a very real issue facing cultures around the world. Relooted is in development for Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the near future where a treaty has been signed that is meant to force museums to repatriate artifacts to their home countries – most significantly for this game, to Africa – museums have found a loophole that only artifacts on display need to be repatriated, so shove everything back into storage.</p>
<p>In Retooled, you manage a team based in Johannesburg in South Africa, following leads and cooking up plans to break in to museums and private collections around the world and steal those artifacts back.</p>
<p>While the game is in a fictional future, the 70 artifacts from Western museums and private collections are real, each with history to learn about in-game. There’s been estimates that some 90% of sub-Saharan African artifacts, including human remains, are in museums and collections.</p>

<p>For the game itself, you’ll have to figure out a way to sneak into each level, before grabbing the artifact and then racing out as fast as you can, avoiding hazards, drones and traps as you go.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this raises awareness of this issue so that, next time Greece asks if they can have the Elgin Marbles back, maybe the UK gives it half a thought?</p>

		<p>It’s time to go back to higher education with Escape Academy: Back 2 School, as Coin Crew Games has revealed their escape room sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School - Summer Game Fest 2025 Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owh9OAeOMYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Escape Academy 2 looks to go bigger and broader than the original. Yes, there’s still the individual escape room challenges to take on, but this game has an all-new campus that you can wander around, filled with free roam puzzles. Can you unravel the conspiracy that swirls around the school again?</p>
<p>As with the original, you’ll be able to play solo, or get a buddy to play with you in either online or local co-op.</p>
<p>The first Escape Academy was an escape room delight, Coin Crew putting their real escape room designing chops to use in video game form. In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/13/escape-academy-review/">Escape Academy review</a>, I said, “Escape Academy captures the spirit of escape rooms in excellent fashion, wrapping up a string of thoroughly enjoyable puzzle-filled levels in a light and quirky story. Puzzle aficionados might find it a little easy, but it’s a commendable first effort that left me wanting more.”</p>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> launch today, 1047 had one more surprise for their portal-infused shooter: a whole battle royale mode! Even if that isn’t your thing, the rest of this Halo-inspired portally arena shooter could well be up your alley, and it’s out today across PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement of the battle royale mode came with some big ttalk on the stage of Summer Game Fest, as 1047 boss NAME decried playing “the same” Call of Duty every year, and wished that we could just finally get a Titanfall 3, please.</p>
<p>But that’s beside the point, really. Splitgate 2 is out now. From what I’ve played of the beta, it’s pretty fun.</p>
