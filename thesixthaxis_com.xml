		<p>One of the original team who pushed for the creation of the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley,&nbsp; has suggested that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, has been appointed to see the gradual wind down of the brand – because it’s nothing to do with AI.</p>
<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” Blackley told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night.”</p>


<p>“It just seems really true. I imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn’t like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who’d never seen a live show. Why would you do that?” he adds.</p>
<p>“The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI,” he continues. “That’s what you’re seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that’s what we’re seeing.”</p>
<p>He also had some views on how the gaming community would react to Sharma’s appointment, first stating the gamers are very tolerant of non-gamers telling them what to believe, but then make it’s clear he is joking, “No, they’re not tolerant of any of these things. That’s the wall she’s about to discover.”</p>

<p>Seamus Blackley is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-blackley-25733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently</a> CEO of Pacific Light &amp; Hologram, a “technology start-up working in stealth mode to realise fully immersive 3D experience.” He also taught the world how to make Sourdough bread using ancient yeast and historical baking methods during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>You can read the full interview over on <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>, it’s well worth a read. You can also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">read our thoughts about outgoing CEO. Phil Spencer’s legacy here.</a></p>
<p>Do you think Xbox will continue as a brand or get sidelined by Microsoft as the chase AI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced the requirements for the PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, some free DLC, and the performance options for the game.</p>
<p>“Death Stranding 2 for PC offers a range of Graphics Presets from Low to Very High, catering to both budget gaming PC’s and high-end systems,” say Nixxes, who are handling the port. “We’ve also added a Portable preset, aimed at handheld gaming devices, for those Porters who want to “keep on keeping on” while on the go.”</p>



<p>The performance-enhancing options are a special Chinese herb that has been used for millennia, which guarantees at least three extra inches to satisfy…. wait, wrong press release.</p>
<p><em>“The PC edition of Death Stranding 2 launches with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 4 and Intel XESS 2. Both upscaling and frame generation options are available for all technologies.”</em></p>

<p><em>“For the first time on PC, you’ll find Pico as an option in Upscale Settings. This “Progressive Image Compositor” is developed by Guerrilla for the Decima engine and is the same upscaling technology that’s used for Death Stranding 2 on PS5. Pico upscaling can be used with all supported graphics cards and can be combined with the various options for frame generation offered in the game.”</em></p>
<p><em>“All upscaling options can be used in combination with Dynamic Resolution Scaling, or with an upscaling quality setting of choice to improve performance. Native AA options are also available for maximum fidelity.”</em></p>
<p>You will also be able to play on ultra-wide screens if you have one, with all of the cut scenes in 21:9 aspect ratio and gameplay in 32:9 ratio.&nbsp; If you do not have an ultra-wide screen monitor you can still play in those resolutions but with some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>This mode will also be coming to the PS5 version of the game, and PS5 players will also get the Porter Suit: Link and Patch: Link for free when the game launches on PC.</p>

<p>I reviewed the PS5 version of Death Stranding 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/"> scoring it 8/10.</a> “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end,” said I. “The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>
