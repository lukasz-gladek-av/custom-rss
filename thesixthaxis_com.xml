		<p>You will soon be able to sheath your Fortnite character in a Fantastic Four skin. These delightful creations are to tie in with the Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which can be seen in UK cinemas from July 25th 2025.</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four skins have not been detailed, but it is assumed that you will be able to purchase all four members of the team: Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and the Thing. Data miners have porked around in the code and found the details below, but nothing official has been posted.</p>


<ul>
<li>Reed Richards: – Skin, has a beard – Emote (With Prop &amp; Hologram) – Glider – Bundle</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Skin – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: – Skin (Normal &amp; Fire Style) – Emote – Emoji – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>The Thing: – Skin – Spray – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Epic have not posted a release date but it is assumed it will be somewhere near the launch date of the film. Galactus is the main villain in the movie, but it is rumoured that many lesser-known characters may make an appearance so they may get a Fantastic Four skin as well.</p>
<p>Data miners have also found reference to four pairs of Nike shoes that are linked to the characters, all of which are based on existing real world kicks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reed Richards:- Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: -Red and orange Air Max 95s</li>
<li>The Thing: – Orange Dunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four skins are the latest Superheroes to be added to the game,&nbsp; on July 10th a version of Superman based on the new DC movie starring David Corenswet was added to the game. Previous additions included Dead Pool, Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Blade, Harley Quinn, Batman and Spider-Man.</p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed the next entry into the Sudden Strike series with the announcement of Sudden Strike 5, which is due to come out in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To mark this announcement, Kalypso Media has put Sudden Strike 4 on sale until Sunday 20th July, with the base game and all the DLC available for $16. An announcement trailer for Sudden Strike 5 has also been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sudden Strike 5 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlNfzXuifFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Much like the previous games in the series, Sudden Strike 5 will be set during World War 2 and maintain the real time strategy gameplay. This entry will have 25 missions in the main campaign, and give players access to 300 units, with this split between 190 vehicles and 110 infantry units. Players can also select a commander that is best suited to their strategic thinking. During play, you will be able to see the whole battlefield from above allowing for better tactical planning as you look to capture and defend key resources including headquarters and supply depots. Sudden Strike 5 will feature online PvP multiplayer too, so you can face off against other commanders to determine who has the best tactical ability.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in Sudden Strike 5, a closed beta will be taking place through which players can test the game and provide feedback to the developers ahead of the full release next year. To sign up for the Sudden Strike 5 closed beta you need to visit the official <a href="https://www.kalypsomedia.com/sudden-strike-5">Sudden Strike 5</a> website.</p>

		<p>EA has taken a slightly different approach this year for its EA Sports FC 26 reveal trailer. Instead of just having footballers running around and playing the beautiful game, this reveal trailer addresses player complaints about the previous entries to the series and how FC 26 is looking to improve them. Of course, there are still the big name stars present in the trailer including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Jude Bellingham, and Jamal Musiala.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,”</em> said John Shepherd, VP &amp; GM, EA SPORTS FC. <em>“We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these changes coming to EA Sports FC 26 a bit more, beginning with the Archetypes system. The Archetypes system will be part of Clubs and Player Career, with it being a class system. As part of Archetypes you will be able to unlock and develop different attributes, along with Archetype perks that provide additional bonuses. These perks are based on some of the best players in football. The gameplay is getting overhauled again to make things more fluid and responsive, with examples being better dribbling, improved goalkeeper reactions, better ball behaviour, more fluid passing, and better off the ball player movement and interactions. As part of the overhaul Competitive Gameplay and Authentic Gameplay presets will be available to choose from. Competitive Gameplay is aimed for the multiplayer parts of FC 26 including Clubs and Ultimate Team, while the Authentic preset is more for single player modes like career.</p>
<p>Manager Career is being changed for this release too with the introduction of Manager Live. Manager Live will introduce various challenges into the manager career mode, and there will be new scenarios introduced that are based upon real world football events. In Ultimate Team, there will be new live events and tournaments to take part in. Rivals and Champs will also be given updates too. Finally, EA has confirmed FC 26 will include over 35 leagues, over 750 teams across clubs and international, 120 stadiums, and over 20,000 footballers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review, I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>
