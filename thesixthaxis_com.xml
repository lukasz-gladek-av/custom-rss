		<p>An open beta for Steel Hunters, Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game, is now live on Steam as part of a broader Steam Publisher Weekend for the World of Tanks company.</p>
<p>The Steel Hunters beta is live now and through the weekend, from 20th February until 24th February, with a little competition to find the top players each day and prizes to be won.</p>


<p>Through the weekend, the top 10 players on the daily leaderboard will have a chance to win Steam gift cards and exclusive physical merchandise. All players will be able to compete and unlock a Trenchwalker skin that will carry through to the full game.</p>

<p>Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games. This is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>

<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>
<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game’s open beta to try it out for yourself.</p>

		<p>Funcom has announced that the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will launch on 20th May 2025 for PC, priced at $49.99, with the console release remaining TBC.</p>
<p>In the meantime, PC gamers can get a slight headstart with the freely available Character Creator and Benchmark Mode to test your hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The character creator and benchmarking tool is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">available now via Steam</a>, with gamers that download and open it up able to receive a free Frameblade knife skin.</p>
<p>The character creator is themed around the Reverend Mother’s test of the Gom Jabbar, letting you fiddle with ever aspect of your appearance, select your home planet, caste and mentor. This can then be imported into the full game at launch.</p>

<p>The benchmark sequence will use a fly-through of a player-built base in the desert, racing through to Harko Village – the Harkonnen player hub – and conclude with an encounter with a huge sandworm that defines this iconic sci-fi world. This should give a decent baseline to determine your PC performance and adjust graphics settings to meet your goals.</p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games have been popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>
