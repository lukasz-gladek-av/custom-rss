		<p>Update 1.55 is out now for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and it’s got some great new cars and additions to the racing game, including a new formula car inspired by classic 90s F1 designs, and wider support for the Gran Turismo Sophy AI.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - January 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLBtn5F5j2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Four cars have been added in Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gran Turismo F3500-A</li>
<li>Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) ’87</li>
<li>Hyundai IONIQ 5 N ‘24</li>
<li>Toyota C-HR S ’18</li>
</ul>
<p>All four can be purchased from Brand Central, giving us a modern crossover SUV, a rather popular electric car, an 80s touring car classic, and the original formula racing car as well.</p>
<p>The F3500-A is inspired by early 90s F1 cars, and I can definitely see shades of the Williams FW14B and FW15C, the McLaren MP4/8 and Jordan 191 in the curved from nose down to the front wing – there’s going to be some awesome custom liveries for this probably by later today! In-game, this will have a 3.5L naturally aspirated V12 that’s going to scream with high RPMs as you go through the 6-speed semi-auto gearbox.</p>

<p>Beyond the cars, there’s a new Extra Menu No. 43 for Group C cars, and there’s new World Circuit events:</p>
<p>Sunday Cup: Kyoto Driving Park – Miyabi<br>
Japanese FF Challenge 450: Sardegna – Road Track – C<br>
World Touring Car 600: Autódromo de Interlagos</p>
<p>Gran Turismo Sophy has also been expanded to two more circuits, no available to race against at Autódromo de Interlagos and Mount Panorama Circuit.</p>
<p>A strong update to start 2025!</p>
<p>Here’s the other patch notes for Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55 with some relief for driving over bumpy surfaces and dirty tyres in the physics simulation:</p>
