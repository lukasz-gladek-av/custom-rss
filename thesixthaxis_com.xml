		<p>Now I am not going to suggest the people behind these leaks are making stuff up, but at this point, almost any Xbox exclusive title seems likely to come to PS5. Microsoft has broken the barrier and with PS5 sales massively outstripping Xbox sales throwing a bunch of older games to hungry PS5 players is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>


<p>If you are reeling from the idea of Halo on PlayStation, he also suggests that the rumoured Gears of War collection will also come to PS5.</p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo"> adds</a> “I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are already set to land on PS5 this year.</p>
<p>It’s not all one way though, Nate also suggests that Final Fantasy VII Remake will land on&nbsp; Xbox this year with Rebirth following in 2026.</p>

		<p>A new gameplay overview video has been released by Rebellion for its upcoming survival action game Atomfall. Set after the real Windscale nuclear accident in British history, Atomfall is an alternate take on what happened after the events, with much more having gone wrong. Players are held within a quarantine zone where soldiers, bandits, and other dangers lurk.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCGyfXGPSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Atomfall gameplay video gives us a look at the world, including the village where you will spend a lot of time, plus the wilds and bunkers nearby. The start of the game will be quite Fallout-esque, in the sense you wake up and are unfamiliar with the world outside. The player character is a complete amnesiac, which gives a large amount of freedom in how you survive in this world. You could try and help everyone or be a menace to different groups. One of the groups present is the British military, who were sent in to establish the quarantine zone. However, under the rule of the military things are very strict with even the slightest indiscretion being an excuse for them to punish you.</p>
<p>The military are not the only potential threat. Outside the borders of the village, things are more dangerous. Outlaws and bandits roam this area, posing a real danger to the player. They will attack on sight, without a care of whether you could be friendly. The old quarry, the surrounding hills, and other locations all have their own secrets to discover. They also have resources that you will need to survive the world of Atomfall, The bunkers are home to irradiated creatures and patrolling security robots, both of which will attack players on sight too. But, these bunkers are key to discovering what happened so they will need to be explored.</p>
<p>Combat will be a mix of close up melee combat, with cricket bats being a weapon of choice. There are guns like pistols, shotguns, and rifles too, but as this is England ammo will not be easy to find. Using items found in the environment, weapons can be upgraded so they are more effective against foes. Crafting will be crucial to survival too, allowing players to make things such as bombs and healing items. A metal detector will be part of player’s inventory too, letting player’s search the ground for buried supply caches. Manuals will be found in the world of Atomfall too, unlocking new skills for your character like weapon throwing. The skills are grouped within four categories; ranged combat, melee combat, survival, and conditioning.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4 from March 27th, 2025.</p>
