		<p>Housemarque’s bullet hell roguelite successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a> is set to launch on 30th April, and with such little time before release, they’ve shared a look at the overarching progression and structure of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OcLGdMG0L8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The core of the game will be familiar to anyone that played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>, and there’s common ground to a lot of other roguelites in structure. You’ll play, you’ll die, you’ll upgrade and you’ll try again.</p>
<p>Between runs, Arjun Devraj (Rahul Kohli) is returned to the Passage, a Carcosan temple that is a hub to the game. Here you can talk to other crewmembers of the ship, as well as make use of the upgrade portal. Here you can increase armour, generate a material more quickly, upgrade power capacity for the shield and even the Second Chance system.</p>
<p>There’s also the Carcosan Modifiers, letting you tweak parts of the games difficulty, but for every boon, you’ll have to forego something in return to keep th world in balance. Protection Modifiers can make weapon reloads faster, boost the shield and more, but they’re balanced out by Trial Modifiers making enemies more aggressive, adding weapon power degradation and more. You choose the balance.</p>

<p>A great feature for day one is the inclusion of fast travel, so that you can immediately start a run at the last biome you reached. On death your main and power weapon are kept, so you can return right to the fight and try again, effectively. It’s great to see this will be there on day one, and not arrive in a patch months later.</p>
<p>Finally there’ the eclipse. You can trigger this by reaching a gnarly hand thing, causing the sun to be blocked out, but this sets the world ablaze, introducing corrupted enemies, changing the environments and more. The sound of the world is also twisted, with Sam Slater’s soundtrack gaining more distortion and layering.</p>

		<p>The platforming icon Rayman is marking his thirtieth birthday (last year) with Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition, launching… well, today, at the time of writing. 13th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition – Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6si6GIKIg24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by Digital Eclipse, this is a love letter to the arm-less helicoptering wonder and his debut game. There’s actually five versions of this game included in the bundle – PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance – &nbsp;all of which have been reformatted for modern consoles and screens. There’s also 120 additional levels from the Rayman’s New Levels pack, Rayman 60 Levels and Rayman by His Fans, and you can step back even further with early prototypes of the game that have been spruced up to be playable.</p>
<p>Throughout, the originals have been enhanced in the way many remakes and remasters are with a reimagined soundtrack by composer&nbsp;Christophe Héral alongside optional gameplay features, like a 60 second rewind, instant level unlocks and infinite lives.</p>
<p>And then there’s the documentary features that include 50 minutes of interviews with the original Ubisoft Montpellier team, concept art, sketches, design documents and more.</p>

<p>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition is out 13th February digitally, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, NIntendo Switch and PC, with a physical edition coming to certain regions in June.</p>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has shared a gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>, their highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. The video runs for a few minutes, showcasing some of Dylan’s growing abilities, the game’s combat style and the twisted world you’ll be battling through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Gameplay Reveal | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA71hdzim0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer picks up with Dylan on the trail of a Resonant, heading through an Inception-like folded rendition of Manhattan. He revcently acquired Shift as an ability, which allows him to defy the already broken gravity. His weapon is another transforming tool, but compared to the multi-tool gun of Control, this is all about melee. He also has more supernatural abilities for range, and the game looks to encourage you to switch between range and melee</p>
<p>The trailer builds up to snippets of a crazy battle against a giant laser-spewing whale or something, but that’s not the Resonant. No, that seems to be a kind of hammer-wielding ballet dancer?</p>
<p>Clearly there’s plenty more that Remedy don’t want to show just yet, but we’re excited for this one – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-control-resonant/">Control Resonant was right up there on our Most Wanted Games of 2026.</a></p>

<p>Control Resonant is expected to release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

		<p>The co-op Legends mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will launch on March 10th as a free update for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei Legends - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participated in Raids, and played as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format.</p>
<p><em>“Legends will launch with three mission types. In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps. You’ll fight to control territory on each map. While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage. Each map will have its own unique Curses and Blessings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In Story, you’ll team up with another player to tackle a series of 12 missions. After completing each set of three Story missions, you’ll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six. Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</em></p>

<p><em>As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we’ll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself”</em></p>
