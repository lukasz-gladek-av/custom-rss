		<p>If there is a mode that players love in Call of Duty, it is Zombies. It has been a staple since Call of Duty: World At War. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 continues the zombie tradition and there is now a trailer showing some gameplay from the upcoming release, backed with AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. There has also been confirmation that those who pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will get to play Zombies Survival in the beta.</p>

<p>The Black Ops 7 story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil. Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon. There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>
