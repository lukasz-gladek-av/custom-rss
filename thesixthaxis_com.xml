			<p>It’s been far too long, but Shinobi is back! After fourteen years in the wilderness, Joe Musashi has a new main series entry to showcase what he does best; running and jumping from left to right and killing mechanised ninjas with unstoppable style and grace. At this point, I could tease whether Lizardcube has been successful in rebooting one of Sega’s finest, but when a game is this good, it should be shouted about from the opening paragraph. And Shinobi: Art of Vengeance isn’t just good; it’s a masterclass in 2D platforming.</p>

<p>The ENE Corporation is up to no good, and has decided, as you do, to take over the world. The only obstacle in their path to global domination is the Shinobi Joe Musashi and his Ninja village. In a blistering opening chapter, the forces of ENE decimate Joe’s home, forcing the eponymous shinobi to go on a mission of vengeance; and for the player to have a very good time in the process.</p>


<p>First things first, you’ll notice that Shinobi: Art of Vengeance looks bloomin’ gorgeous. Lizardcube did an excellent job with the beautiful 2D visuals and slick animation of Streets of Rage 4, but with Shinobi, they’ve truly outdone themselves. The sumptuous movment of Joe himself is something to behold, as he darts across the screen, flipping over obstacles, unleashing a flame attack, all while his ninja garb billows in the breeze. Levels are cram-packed full of layered detail, with everything from spooky underground labs to stinky fish markets rendered with a visual flare that makes other 2D games green with envy. The character design is gorgeous too. Enemy monsters, mechs, mercs, and mutants have a distinctive and charismatic Bandes dessinées look that makes them a joy to hack apart.</p>


<p>Speaking of the hacking, all the visuals would matter little if the combat didn’t deliver, but thankfully, it absolutely does. Fighting is smooth, responsive, and bombastically satisfying. The only blemish in the other wise silky smooth skin of Joe Musashi is some pesky slow down that can sneak in when a whole load of explosions are kicking off on screen – hopefully an issue that can soon be remedied.</p>
<p>Each combat encounter is meticulously crafted, demanding that the player moves and thinks like a ninja, darting around the environment to take out vulnerable targets before focusing on bringing down bigger foes. Joe has a number of unlockable combos at his disposal, many of them bringing a welcome Dante-like juggle to proceedings, allowing you to knock enemies into the air before delivering a cavalcade of strikes and then seamlessly transitioning into one of the varied and visually explosive special attacks at your disposal. Ultimately, combat comes down to managing the space, separating enemies and fighting them on your terms, as it’s all too easy to be overwhelmed by their sheer numbers if you just button bash. Lizardcube places other demands on the player too, varying encounters by incorporating healers, snipers, and little things that take great delight in exploding in your face in order to keep things fresh. The challenge is furious but fair, pushing you to your limit and ensuring you earn your way to the boss.</p>

<p>Bosses are eminently memorable, each encounter testing different aspects of Joe’s ninja abilities. Be it using your newly acquired grappling hook to reach a flying foe or utilising your shield smashing abilities to break through a big bad’s defences, each bout has a reason for existing, rather than being stuck at the end of a level just for the sake of it. The bosses themselves are wonderfully distinctive too, from demons who attack you with the sword impaled in their own chest, to enormous screen smothering beasties, and a host of returning foes that are sure to please series stalwarts. Thankfully, every boss fight shares one consistent quality; they’re initially brutal, but once you’ve finally learned the attack patterns and incorporated your newest ability correctly, you can wipe the floor with your foe in seconds, leading to you feeling like a total super ninja bad ass.</p>
<p>Platforming is, as you would hope, precise and thrilling. Joe does double jumping, dashing, and wall climbing with easy abandon. Whilst it’s certainly challenging making your way past a cornucopia of traps, a suite of accessibility options makes the game doable for players of any ability. You can tinker with nearly every element of difficulty, even lowering the damage the traps cause so they are a mere annoyance rather than a game over causing insta-killer. But if you want unrelenting pain in your game, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance has you covered. Each level can be returned to and further explored with your new abilities, we’re not talking to a labyrinthian metroidvania extent, but there’s certainly a host of secrets to be found off the beaten path.</p>

<p>My one small gripe? Once you’ve uncovered a secret, it remains highlighted on the map, causing confusion if your trying to one hundred percent each level. However, this frustration is eased by the smart decision to allow the place to fast travel to any save point at any time, preventing any irritation from running along the same corridors again and again to get to the bit you want to further explore. Some of these secrets are brutal combat encounters against specialist troops, whilst others offer the demanding platforming perfection last scene in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Many of these were out of reach of my abilities, but the few I did manage resulted in some darn cool new weapons, spells, and skills, each shaking up combat encounters and traversal in fun ways, so there’ll no doubt be many more treats for the skilful player to discover.</p>
<p>What’s the downside to all this brilliance? Well, there’s an undoubted brevity to Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, you’ll see through the main story in six hours or so, depending on your ability level, and everything else in a few more. But when every minute of the experience is killer, with no filler, is that really such a problem?</p>

		<p>Turok’s heyday as a first person shooter franchise came and went in what feels like a blink of Mario’s eye. Bursting onto the N64 to pioneer the first person shooter on console, half a year before GoldenEye, and being an FPS mainstay over the following years. But Turok’s time-travelling, dino-blasting adventures lost their lustre when trying to jump to later generations, and it’s now been some 17 years since the last attempt. Saber are no strangers to a licensed franchise reboot, though, and are hoping to weave the same magic that they did for Space Marine 2 for Turok: Origins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turok: Origins - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK2sg_RgY2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Turok world has existed since the 1950, going through multiple iterations as the variously named Turok characters –&nbsp;is it their actual name, or an honorific? –&nbsp;gradually come to battle dinosaurs across time and space. Turok: Origins reimagines this once again, with the team at Saber stating right up front that they’ve engaged with the Native American community to ensure that the way that their culture is represented is respectful. Of course, this is still a comic book-inspired sci-fi action romp with squads of soldiers from the Order of Turok being a bit like a planet-hopping Native American Delta Force.</p>


<p>Oh, right. Turok: Origins is now all about co-op play instead of a sole hero, with up to three players diving in to take the fight to the reptillians and Xenia, able to lean into different weapon loadouts and character builds to compliment one another. It’s also both a first person and a third person shooter, letting you switch back and forth with a long button press, right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>For our hands on, we jumped through a handful of different scenarios, getting to see the different aspects of co-op shooter that Turok: Origins provides.</p>


<p>It started with a trek through a reptile-filled maze of a swamp, looking to battle through these basic enemies to reach power nodes and gain access to the next area. While we navigated the lower pathways of this area, various reptilian enemies would come at us, often shooting lasers from the tops of ridge-lines, or dropping down from them to close the gaps.</p>
<p>Before heading into the fray, we’d had the choice of three biomorphic Mantle suits and prepared weapon and ability loadouts. Raven came with a high-tech bow and arrow, rifle with bouncing projectiles and rocket launcher, while Bison’s shotgun made them great for closer range, combined with a pulse rifle and minigun for laying down damage. I also rather enjoyed Cougar, though, coming with an automatic crossbow and something called a Cerebral Bore to home in and explode the heads of enemies. All of these weapons had alternate fire modes, some lifted directly from previous games and some new creations.</p>

<p>While we didn’t really have time to fully explore each of the abilities granted to us, there’s a progression system for all aspects of your loadout, from the weapons to the abilities and the Mantle itself, which is a conduit for unlocking an animalistic primal energy within you. Through gathering the echoes from fallen enemies and plants in the environment, you can unlock the ability to use in combat. It’s something that can build up quite quickly as well, encouraging you to quickly use the powers as soon as they charge up and deal as much damage as possible.</p>
<p>That became more important as we made our way through each successive demo area. From the first labyrinthine area, we jumped to a facility of the Xenia forces, with a bony alien look to it as we progressed deeper and fought through now humanoid Xenia aliens. This area gave us a first use of the grapple hook, enhancing movement with grapple points to let us get up to higher platforms and navigate multi-layered areas.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead once again, and the hunt for a superweapon to turn the tide of war took us to an ancient temple biome, descending into darkness with more of a platforming angle, though with some fights against Xenia lieutenants and a variety of other enemies to keep things mixed up. The real treat, though, was the battle against a giant cybernetically enhanced triceratops. This towering beast could blast energy from its electrically charged horns, unleashed bullet hell barriers of energy to avoid, and could even teleport around before reappearing and rampaging through the arena.</p>
<p>All I’ll say is that it was actually quite handy that the Gamescom demo seemed to have deaths disabled, or I would have been downed half a dozen times during the tougher segments of this demo.</p>
<p>As a first taster of this game, I’m certainly intrigued and curious to see more of how Saber is reimagining and rebooting this franchise. Thirty minutes was not really long enough to dig deep into the various gameplay mechanics, the co-op and to appreciate the differences between a bunch of different loadouts, but there’s clearly a lot of variety baked into the new narrative, good touches like the 1st and 3rd person toggle, and bombastic dinosaur battling. There’s still a fondness for Turok from the N64’s heyday, and a new beginning could certainly bring this series back to the forefront.</p>
