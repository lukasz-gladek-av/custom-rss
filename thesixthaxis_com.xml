		<p>Cool and Good Games has confirmed that it will be taking more time to develop Starminer, meaning it will not be coming to Steam Early Access just yet. In an update video, the developers gave the reasons for the time needed with much of it to do with Starminer’s scope and making sure every system works together properly. The good news is that Cool and Good Games will be inviting 500 more testers to provide feedback, allowing the team to scale the game properly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dev Update | Developers to Community" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbuAvV6XeH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is no new release window for Starminer, but the dev team did recently provide answers in a recent Q&amp;A. In terms of release, Cool and Good Games have stated it will be able to determine that through the next phase of beta testing. The team has also confirmed it is working on a feature to allow players to share blueprints of their spacestations with others, and there are no build limits so stations can grow as big as you want them to. Starminer will have campaign, sandbox, and survival modes. The campaign will help players get to grips with Starminer’s systems while allowing some creative freedom, and you will learn more about the game’s lore through this mode too. Sandbox is a much more customisable experience allowing choices of starting ship, starting location, and whether enemies are active. Survival will have players facing endless waves of enemies with the goal to stay alive for as long as possible. Physics also plays a crucial part in Starminer with structural integrity and mass really impacting how your station moves. You can move using direct controls though the team is also working on a point and click navigation system too. You will also be able to manage the power levels of ships, allowing you to toggle consumption of various modules including factories, shields, and lasers.</p>
<p>In Starminer, your goal is to build an interstellar mining fleet to find resources among the asteroids in space, and sell those resources for profit. However, doing so will incur the wrath of alien civilisations that will do all that they can to stop you from stripping areas of resources. To counter them you can have warships and defense platforms as part of your fleet.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nascar-25-review-%E2%80%93-heart-pounding-racing-action.1331191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>A little bit of context goes a long way. Just like Drive to Survive brought thousands of new fans to Formula 1, NASCAR: Full Speed has done a good job of selling the American-based racing series to places that think Daytona is just an old Sega game and that NASCAR drivers only know how to turn left. NASCAR 25 has a whole new audience to court then, and as the best (and admittedly only) place to properly embody drivers like Denny Hamlin and Ryan Blaney, this could be NASCAR’s breakout year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NASCAR 25 | Official Hype Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEIYrJoXBf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Career mode is framed in moving style by Dale Earnhardt Junior’s journey from a promising rookie to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and it certainly sets the right tone for a game that’s designed to take you to sporting glory. Alongside the on-track action, vehicle tuning, and back-office tinkering, there’s a series of Dale JR Download podcast shows that make the experience feel thoroughly authentic, and bring you right into the thick of the world of NASCAR.</p>


<p>Creating a character is as laughably short as inputting a name, but you’ll be glad to discover that there’s a whole suite of much more important customisation options beyond that, letting you choose your car and team logo, your racing number, and then dig right into the visual look of your car, helmet and race suit. It’s easy and intuitive, and while you might be able to do more with various other racing games, I appreciated the straightforward batch of controls, and you unlock more designs as you progress.</p>


<p>The greatest shade thrown at NASCAR by racing fans around the world is that there’s no art to going round and round in a circle. NASCAR 25 shows that not only are they utterly wrong, but you need to find a place of zen and calm to be in with a hope of taking home a trophy. NASCAR is about driving on the absolute knife-edge of speed, holding your racing line, staying out of trouble, and doing so consistently, lap after lap. There isn’t anything easy in that, and frankly, I found it utterly mesmerising. Also, some of the tracks do actually have corners, with races at COTA, Sonoma, Watkins Glen and some street circuits as well, depending on the championship.</p>
<p>Somehow, the fact that your input has to be so precise, so smooth, and so controlled, makes your heart thump with the force of a punctured tyre. While Days of Thunder famously said that rubbing is racing, you’re ideally going to work your way through the pack without too much friction, finding yourself let loose by the minute mistakes made by other drivers. Honestly, it’s about the most edge-of-the-seat racing experience I’ve had in, well, forever. There’s no rewind, only a restart, and the smallest mistake can be the difference between the top 5 and 35th. It feels excellent.</p>

<p>Completing events sees you earning Rep. That’s not just based on where you finished the race, but also hitting your target in practice and qualifying, your lap speed, leading a race, and whether you raced clean. That last one is perhaps the hardest one to earn – there’s bound to be at least a little jostling in the pack – but it gives you other things to target beyond that elusive first place, and it can lead to better opportunities with sponsors, and the opportunity to earn more money.</p>
<p>There’s another reason to keep things clean, as each part of your car carries a Performance Rating. If you damage them, it’ll affect the overall performance of your vehicle, making it much tougher to perform well on race day. You’ll also get a social media blast from your opponents if they feel like you weren’t exactly trying not to run into them, and some of these definitely raised a few wry smiles along the way.</p>

<p>The pace of NASCAR 25’s Career mode might also raise a few more smiles, as it has options that allow it to be punchier and faster than you’d expect from the notoriously long-winded category. At a mere 7% race length, Practice, Qualifying and the race itself might see you complete as few as 5 to 10 laps in total, and then the back office repairs and PR choices tend to be fairly straightforward and binary. Repair decisions do become slightly tougher later on as you balance resources and cash, but the admin definitely takes a back seat to the on-track action.</p>
<p>Fans of NASCAR will be glad to know that you can race each race to its full length, and one of NASCAR 25’s greatest strengths is its adjustability. You can opt for a much lighter sim experience, dialling down the length, difficulty and damage, or you can move all the sliders to the right and make things as realistic and challenging as possible. What shines throughout is the handling model, which feels absolutely tuned in. Playing with controller is certainly an easier experience, but if you want the closest thing to being on track yourself, grab your steering wheel and check out just how good NASCAR 25 feels.</p>
<p>As you progress through Career mode, you move up through the different race categories, and you can participate in the Craftsmen Truck series at the same time, with races happening through the same weekend, maximising your time on track, which, depending on where you are could be a blessing or a curse. Your team changes and evolves as you progress too, and you can fire and hire new staff in each crucial role, giving you a boost when it comes to repairs, or helping you to gain more Rep. You may find yourself becoming strangely attached to them, and I felt a few twinges of guilt as I sacked a staff member that had been with me for a while.</p>
<p>While the Career mode is likely the main draw, you’ve got the option of Quick Race, Championship and 40-player online multiplayer to sink your teeth into as well. The multiplayer is often as chaotic as you’d expect, but if you hit upon the Goldilocks of lobbies, it’s a great experience, with reliably smooth performance and connection. Through these modes, there’s also a full roster of racers, from Cup Series stars like Byron, Hill and Reddick through to up and coming drivers like Brenden Queen and Andres Perez. The whole thing feels thoroughly authentic.</p>

<p>While this might be the premier rendition of the racing category, there’s a few elements that occasionally make it feel like slightly more of a budget release than you might be expecting. Some visual elements of the UI are very basic, and while there’s customisation, your character doesn’t even get the option of a placeholder image, or an actual character model. The car upgrade system also doesn’t extend very far beyond the fact that more expensive parts are better, which is a shame, and definitely loses out on an injection of depth into your downtime between races.</p>

		<p>Valve has released a new feature for Steam so people can discover games they may be interested in, as well as keeping an eye on games that they are already interested in. The new feature is the Personal Calendar, which displays games that have been recently released and is also populated with games that you may be interested in based on playtimes of similar users and the games they have been wishlisting. The feature is currently a Steam Labs experiment, so it will likely have changes made to it. You can check out your own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/personalcalendar?snr=1_2108_9__2107">calendar at the link.</a></p>
<p>The Personal Calendar only has Monday to Friday showing due to games rarely being released on weekends, and it will cover a rolling eight week period so it is not overwhelming. You can further customise the calendar to filter out different tags and determine how many game recommendations it is showing, with the default set to 100. It is also already populated with games that you have wishlisted, so you can see when a game you are wanting to play is going to be released. The recommendations themselves will be updated daily, but Valve does not see the recommended games changing too often due to the parameters that have been set. This is because as well as using similar profiles to provide recommendations, Steam will also take into account the games you are and have been playing, using the most played ones to populate the calendar too.</p>


<p>When it comes to the feedback Valve is looking for, the company has said, <em>“Really, we’re interested to know whatever feedback you may have about this experiment. Do you find this format of recommendations to be useful? What do you think about this new set of recommendations and calendar view? Are there other things we should include on the calendar? Does it seem to be generating good recommendations for you?”</em></p>
<p>To give feedback you join the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamLabs/discussions/19/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">discussions for Experiment 16: Personal Calendar</a>.<wbr></p>

		<p>Paper Cult has announced that following feedback from players that played the Tears of Metal Steam Next Fest demo, the decision has been made to push the game’s release back. The new release window that has been given is Q1 2026, allowing the development team to take on board the feedback and use the additional time to polish up later parts of Tears of Metal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tears of Metal - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdt4o55qMG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Paper Cult Games said, <em>“First off, a massive thank you to everyone who played the demo, shared feedback, ideas, and reviews! Your support has been incredible, we’re honestly blown away. During Steam Next Fest, Tears of Metal climbed all the way to #16 in player count, earning a spot in Steam’s “50 Most-Played Demos of the October 2025 Event.” That’s huge for us and it’s all thanks to you!Even more heartwarming was earning the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review rating on the demo. It’s been an incredible boost to our morale, and we can’t wait to get the full game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>With all this momentum and plenty (or dare I say infinite) of new feedback in hand, we’ve decided to shift our release window to Q1 2026. We mostly want to take the extra time to polish the experience in the later part of the game. We promise, the wait will be worth it! Thanks again for marching with us. Your support truly gives us the final push to make Tears of Metal everything it deserves to be.”</em></p>

<p>Tears of Metal is a hack and slash co-op roguelike set in the Scottish Highlands. Hordes of enemies have invaded your home island, so it is up to you and your battalion of Scottish warriors to cleave through this vast number of soldiers to take back the island, and discover more about the Dragon Stone Meteor which caused the invasion to begin with. Tears of Metal has been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Galaxies Gaming Showcase, Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios have tempered expectations around the release date for Mouse: P.I For Hire, the 1930’s cartoon inspired first person shooter. A little while ago, the studio said that there would be a release date announcement for the game this weekend, but now that has changed with Mouse: P.I. For Hire now no longer releasing in 2025, but in early 2026 instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire - Troy Baker is Jack Pepper | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QhWXpfjBjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios said, <em>“Hey everyone. We know that you are excited for the release date announcement of Mouse: P.I. For Hire at the Galaxies Gaming Showcase this week 23 October. Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026. The support you have shown over the years has meant the world to us. Our single highest priority is for the game to deliver you the best possible experience, and this will help ensure we can live up to that goal. Thanks for everything and we will see you at Galaxies!”</em></p>
<p>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is due to be released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>
