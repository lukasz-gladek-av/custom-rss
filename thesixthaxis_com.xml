		<p>A pair of behind the scenes videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, the delightful, hand-crafted co-op platformer from Kong Orange, WiredFly and Epic Games Publishing.</p>
<p>Out of Words stars Kurt and Karla, whose mouths have disappeared and need to adventure through the colourful world of Vokabulantis. A story about the first time they ever held hands, it’s a game to be played in co-op, whether locally or online.</p>


<p>However, not everyone is without a mouth, and they have a teasing older brother-like figure in the form of the rather mocking Prince.</p>
<p>The first of two videos sees Art Director Mikkel discussing how the character was designed, from how extravagant he is to some of the back and forth about visual details.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet a Real Stop Motion Prince | Out of Words Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9k2v5flAmUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second goes further into the actual craftsmanship that goes into this game, with&nbsp;Senior Fabricator Sofie Kjær walking us through how the puppet is created, sculpting different expressions, hand positions, and painting the models to conjure the character into stop motion life.</p>

<p>It’s all really rather lovely looking. Out of Words is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> &amp; PC via Epic Games Store in 2026.</p>

		<p>It’s been an unexpectedly hectic week for me away from the video game shenanigans, but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been plenty of gaming in my life still. While this week’s biggest hitters have been put into other people’s hands, as you’ll see below, I’ve had one of next week’s biggest games on the go. I’m keeping that particular card close to my chest for now, but I’ve also had some enjoyably silly times in some tactical shooters, checking out Rainbow 6 Mobile’s launch and chatting to one of the developers, and also jumping into Rogue Point for some lighter, more arcade tactical shooter-ing with Miguel as my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued to dig through his backlog and has been playing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. “I’ve only just got to Hawaii” he says, which makes it sound like he’s following Ichiban’s story in real life…. before continuing “and I’m waiting for the game to open up so I can truly go exploring.”</p>

<p>There’s a big new horror game in town with Resident Evil Requiem and so <strong>Nic</strong> has been playing…. Resident Evil Village. But Steve? <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-review/">Requiem for our review</a> and he’s loved it! He’s started on the speed runs for it, while also checking out the Switch 2 port of Resident Evil 7… and still has found time to return to Breath of Fire 3 for some retro gaming, has the Legacy of Kain: Defiance remaster downloading, and has even snuck in some Steam Next Fest demos! Absolute mad lad.</p>
<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> been playing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War: Sons of Sparta</a>, but he’s not quite sure if he like it. Based on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-review/">Gamoc’s re-review</a>, though, he’s grabbed Echoes of the End in the sale and found that it’s really enjoyable. “It’s the kind of linear third-person action adventure that I absolutely love, but just doesn’t seem to get made much any more. Not an open world, soul, or rogue in sight, and I love it!”</p>


<p>Continuing to wrap himself up in the Wild West of Red Dead Redemption, <strong>Jim</strong> has just about finished the last few story missions, and has now passed through the veil and starting the Undead Nightmare expansion. “It’s a fun reframing of Rockstars open-world cowboy sim and – by 2010 standards – a rather meaty expansion that still has plenty of satirical humour.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuff</strong> has dipped into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> for the Server Slam, but says it “Seems a bit.. empty? Also very odd your team mates can extract without you.” He was abandoned by his fellows after just 15 minutes! Expect more in-depth thoughts on this soon, especially with the full release next week.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s juggled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review-a-stunning-port/">Resident Evil Requiem and its impressive Switch 2 release</a>, Overwatch, where he’s very happy that they’ve ditched the ‘2’, and Monster Hunter Stories 3 for review next week. That’s been most of it, but he’s also had a little bit of Lumines Arise, and made a wee start on Fallout 4’s Switch 2 port. How has that fared?</p>
<p><em>That’s us, but what about you? What have you all been playing?</em></p>

		<p>You do not have long to wait to sail through the skies in your ship because Enjoy Studio has confirmed that Everwind, its sky faring RPG, will be launching into Early Access on March 17th. The aim is to get the full 1.0 release out in 2027 for all platforms. The Early Access launch is PC only at first, but Enjoy Studio has confirmed it is looking at getting Everwind on consoles during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everwind - Early Access Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cv2lcemuOrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the announcement post regarding Everwind’s Early Access release, Enjoy Studio wrote, <em>“Whether you brave the skies alone or team up with up to 4 players, prepare to set sail toward a brand-new world filled with ancient mysteries and dangerous wildlife. Early Access is just the beginning. Throughout the year, we’re planning regular updates, expanding the world, refining systems, and introducing new content as we move toward full release. We’ll be sharing our complete roadmap soon so you can see exactly what lies ahead.”</em></p>
<p>Everwind is a co-op survival RPG where the hook is that your base is a flying island ship that you can take across a procedurally generated world. The world itself is filled with floating islands with each one having its own things to discover from ruins and caves, to animals that could pose a threat, and all sorts of resources to keep your ship flying. A detailed roadmap is going to be released at a later date which will give us a much better idea of what to expect through the early access journey.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/27/sprawl-zero-announced-and-its-looking-to-bring-back-the-vibe-of-early-2000s-fps/</link>

		<p>Maeth has announced a prequel to its hardcore FPS Sprawl with the new entry Sprawl Zero looking to the first person shooters of the early 2000s as inspiration for both look and feel. In the original Sprawl players took on the role of Seven, a special ops super soldier that was trying to survive the Junta. In Sprawl Zero you play as Five, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier who is part of the Junta and is on a mission to kill Silas, the leader of techno-religious group IMAGO-DEI.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPRAWL ZERO - REVEAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju0rQ_aA-aQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From the announcement trailer, you can see that Maeth is really digging into the FPS style of a couple a decades ago. As Five, you have access to 40 weapons, Gravity Gloves, and a Gravity Shield to throw projectiles back at enemies. Enemies will work together to try and contain Five but levels have been designed with multiple pathways so you can find ways to outmanoeuvre enemy squads. There are different enemy factions and types to deal with as you hunt down Silas so you will need to adapt your approach to combat to counter different threats. Sprawl Zero will also feature an original soundtrack whose music has been inspired by the same games that the gameplay has.</p>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Sprawl Zero, but the platforms have been confirmed as PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

			<p>I Hate This Place is based on the cult-favourite Image Comics series of the same name (with the alternative title being the slightly less marketing-friendly Fuck This Place) written by Kyle Starks. This comic features the adventures of a young lesbian couple who inherit a farmhouse, only to find that it is at the centre of a host of mysterious events. The resulting story contains ghosts, monsters, aliens, secret government operations, time travel and just about every other pulp horror trope you can think of. The game takes this inspiration and turns in a thoroughly fine adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Hate This Place - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4P27Vxs3Sns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with your lead character, Elena, and best friend, Lou, attempting to carry out a ritual to summon the mysterious Horned Man – the main antagonist of the original comic books. This ritual immediately goes wrong and Lou disappears. The rest of the game sees Elena trying to track down what has happened to Lou, and in the process discovering much more about the mysteries of Rutherford Ranch.</p>


<p>Aesthetically, I Hate This Place benefits from a suitable cartoony design. Characters and locations look as if they’ve been lifted straight from the pages of a comic book, with text boxes and onomatopoeic sound effect words to match. The latter is used to show the amount of noise that Elena is making – a key aspect for the stealth sections in the game. Voice acting is, however, a little stiff and I found myself skipping the spoken dialogue and relying on the subtitles.</p>


<p>The environments surrounding Rutherford Ranch are relatively varied, with a treacherous swampland, a huge cornfield, threatening forest, cultist village, a mine, and various secret bunkers to explore. Each of these contains a mixture of enemies and environmental puzzles to solve, the latter of which involving a mixture of finding keys, activating switches, and examining notes to find clues for keycodes and passwords. Aside from the exploration, the game also features combat and base building mechanics.</p>
<p>Combat takes place through a mixture of melee and ranged attacks. Your baseball bat can be upgraded, but is mostly to be used as a last resort or restricted to less powerful foes. As you progress through the game you’ll find various ranged weapons or the blueprints to make them at your crafting table, from simple pistols to powerful automatic rifles and shotguns. These take a variety of ammunition, but your inventory is relatively generous meaning that you can carry a real arsenal into your adventures. The automatic rifle in particular proved particularly satisfying, and powerful enough to take down a late game boss before it could really get anywhere near me.</p>

<p>Alongside your health bar, you’ll also need to manage stamina and hunger. Stamina unfortunately continues to drain outside of combat which can make exploring the map more tedious than it should be whilst only really proving a hindrance when resorting to melee attacks. Hunger can be replenished through a range of consumables to prevent it negatively affecting your other stats. On the whole this became just another thing to manage and never really caused much of an issue as consumables are common items. I didn’t really need to resort to the various cooking recipes, instead living on crisps and tins of beans, which reminded me of my student days.</p>
<p>Alongside the items and equipment you find and scavenge you’ll also need to construct various buildings at Rutherford Ranch. At first this is restricted to a simple stove and crafting bench but later more elaborate blueprints can be found such as ammunition tables which can be set to passively work whilst you explore. This part never becomes too complicated but is a welcome addition to the game.</p>

<p>One part of the game that I found surprisingly underwhelming was the overarching story. I finished the game in just under 7 hours and completed most of the side quests – fortunately so, as a lot of the narrative is hidden within these. The main story ends quite abruptly and leaves quite a lot of questions unanswered. I also found that some side quests did not complete properly and I encountered a couple of crashes and bugs where I fell through the floor.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I Hate This Place is close to being a really good fusion of base building and isometric shooter, but never quite nails the game feel. Stealth is mostly a case of sneaking through vents, combat is repetitive and becomes too easy with more powerful weapons, and the base building parts function more like an idle game. To top it off, the story kind of fizzles out and the game ends just as the mechanics start to get established. There is a fun pulp horror experience here, but it doesn’t meet its clear potential.	</p></div>
