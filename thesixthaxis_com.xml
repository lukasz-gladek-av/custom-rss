		<p>Tucked away in the State of Play stream was the confirmation of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games line up for October 2025, with Sony bringing a fantastic horror game to the table for the spookiest month of the year. Have you seen Alan lately?</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus October 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 7th October</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Goat Simulator 3</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is a great headliner for this month’s PS Plus games. After a thirteen year wait, Remedy returned to the setting of one of their most beloved games, but took a distinctly more horror-tinged tone compared to the Xbox 360 original. Still, that totally worked for us. Nick gave it a glowing 10/10, and said:</p>

<p><em>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror. Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 Review –&nbsp;Worth the wait" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qi7NHf15a5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How do you top that? Well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cocoon">Cocoon</a> is a simply sublime little puzzle adventure with worlds nested in worlds. It’s “a beautiful experience that marries a gorgeous aesthetic with increasingly complex puzzles that really push you to experiment with the game’s mechanics,” Steve said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/cocoon-review/">our review</a>. “Whilst it isn’t a long or excessively challenging game, I would urge you to absorb yourselves in its dimension-hopping delights.”</p>

<p>And then you can go all the way into the left field for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a>, the latest entry in the meme-able game series. The game launched back in 2022, with Pilgor the goat going on many an adventure which, through DLC, has included some dimension hopping of its own.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 6th Ocober September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>Psychonauts 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/septembers-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>

		<p>Surprising literally nobody, Flight Simulator 2024 has been announced for PlayStation 5, the latest Xbox exclusive to breach the previous platform divide. The game will arrive on PS5 on 8th December 2025, while PSVR 2 support is also in development for a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Flight Simulator 2024, launched for Xbox and PC at the end of last year, an overhauled successor to the 2020 Flight Simulator, building on the same rendering of the real world that you can fly around, but building in a career mode, more missions, from Search and Rescue to tourism, agricultural crop dusting, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s a great simulator, but I think I’m most intrigued to see how PSVR 2 support looks on console, as the game is pretty heavy to run.</p>

		<p>Housemarque and Sony have released a chunky five minutes of gameplay for the upcoming looper shooter roguelike Saros – the sequel to Returnal. The team have confirmed that Saros is coming to PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> on 20th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | September 24, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QcEoGC51ZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet Carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony which is repeatedly being destroyed by way and the death of the planet’s sun. He’s a bit chattier, it seems, as he has an AI companion, and hunt down Soltari datalog vaults to reveal more of the game’s story.</p>
<p>The gameplay structure will sound pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of Returnal, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Second Chance is one of he permanent progression features, able to revive Arjun on his first death to immediately throw him back into the action of a particular run.</p>
<p>The video built up to the reveal of a big many-armed boss, with many more snippets of titanic gameplay to round things out.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>
