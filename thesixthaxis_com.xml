		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation Stars reward program is coming to an end, shutting off access to new users today, and with a rolling shutdown that will see it fully closed by November 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/14/sony-announced-playstation-stars-loyalty-scheme-with-digital-rewards-not-nft/">Launched in 2022</a>, the two main hooks for PlayStation Stars were the ability to earn digital collectables themed around popular PlayStation properties and franchises, as well as the typical loyalty scheme fare of PlayStation store top ups and vouchers.</p>


<p>It seems that this really didn’t strike a cord with enough people, as the company is now shutting the program down. Personally, I never really “got” what PlayStation Stars was meant to be about. The push for digital collectibles doesn’t speak to me, and the main allure of loyalty programmes like this and Microsoft Rewards is more to do with getting shop vouchers… but that felt like a secondary</p>
<p>“Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to,” wrote Grace Chen, &nbsp;as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.”</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for PlayStation Stars users? Well, the program will still continue to work for the time being, but new members cannot sign up for it. Sony is also no longer going to produce new rewards for it, and everything will kind of be in stasis after July. The program will fully end in November 2026, but PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles after this point… somehow.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting today, PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program.</li>
<li>If members choose to cancel their PlayStation Stars membership starting today, it will not be possible to rejoin this version of the program, and members will lose all earned Points.</li>
<li>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status until July 23, 2025 at 7:59AM PDT | 3:59PM BST | 11:59PM JST. After this date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars Campaigns available, or any additional rewards or status benefits to earn.</li>
<li>This version of the PlayStation Stars program will fully end on November 2, 2026 and current PlayStation Stars members can continue to redeem Points as long as their Points don’t expire before then.</li>
<li>PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles, even after these changes take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the next attempt goes better and is more actively rewarding.</p>
