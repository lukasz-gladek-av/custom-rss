		<p>Having skin is kind of overrated, don’t you think? Looking like a bad guy getting flayed after opening the Ark of the Covenant is definitely the look for the 2100s, and you will soon be able to prove that beauty is more than skin deep with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76’s</a> playable Ghouls when they arrive in early 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Fallout 76 Playable Ghouls –&nbsp;Grabbed by the Ghoul-ies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH2vPV7a4t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, with Ghouls being more popular than ever thanks to Walter Goggins’ star turn as a bounty hunting Ghoul in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">Fallout TV series</a>, you’ll soon be able to play as a Ghoul yourself in Fallout 76. But you aren’t born &nbsp;with it, and it definitely doesn’t involve make up. No, you’ll have to undertake a quest to be all Ghoul-ified once you’re deep into this game – you need to have a level 50 character, to be precise.</p>


<p>It all starts when you pick up a radio transmission from a distressed man who’s just about survived and attack by some rather ghastly bandits, and should you follow up on the call track Leman down as he visits the human doctor, it quickly becomes clear that he’s not going to be long for this world. The only chance he has it to find a… different kind of doctor and scientist way up in the North East of the map. Maybe they someway, somehow have a solution?</p>
<p>Well, since they’re part of a secretive society of Ghouls, they might have a thought or two on how to handle lethal doses of radiation, and so their solution is to transform Leman into a Ghoul himself. Along the way you’re given some almost perfunctory decisions to make. Do you egg Leman on and encourage him to accept the transformation to join this small community of outcasts? And following that, will you more willingly choose to become a Ghoul yourself?</p>


<p>There’s a ton of reasons why you might want to. You lose none of the stats and skills that you have from before, but there’s now a whole new endgame progression to engage in with 30 new Special cards focussed on all the special traits and abilities of the Ghoul characters.</p>
<p>The biggest perk is that Ghouls are not only resistant to the radiation that caused their transformation, it will actually help and heal you now. No need to avoid dirty water anymore, you can just slurp it up and eventually gain Glow, even. But you don’t really need to, since you’re no longer subject to hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like Fallout 76 easy mode, then there are some downsides as well. Instead of hunger and thirst, you have to manage your Feral meter which, if you let it get a bit out of hand will significantly debuff your ability to use ranged weapons, though your melee attacks are boosted quite a lot.</p>

<p>Being a Ghoul, pretty much all the regular humans will now absolutely detest you. Any cities and encampments will want to turn you away if you ever show your face, and the Brotherhood of Steel will really not take kindly to your presence… so you’ll now have to hide it. Visit makeover guru Jaye Vo within the Ghoul enclave’s bunker, and she will work wonders to help hide your ghastly appearance from view.</p>
<p>It’s a rather randomised process that can sometimes cover you up with a bandana and nice hat… or basically just wrap your head up in a bin bag with some breathing apparatus. It would be nice to have more flexibility here, as you don’t get to make the choice for what your disguise will be, and have to revisit Jaye Vo to swap between displaying your Ghoul publicly and keeping it private. It’s a bit clumsy and feels like you should have a little more of a handle on it alongside the rest of the customisation suite, where you still have a great deal of freedom to customise your Ghoul’s appearance, right down to the skin texture.</p>
<p>If that all becomes a bit too much, you will have the opportunity to revert from Ghoul-dom to being human. This can be done once for free, as Bethesda don’t really want people switching back and forth at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a rather attractive proposition, especially when considering the kinds of challenges that you will face in Fallout 76’s end game. There’s the recently released Gleaming Depths raid where the sequence of challenging boss fights could use a bit of added durability from your character build, for example, and there’s no doubt that radiation resistance will be handy at more than a few other instances across the irradiated wastelands.</p>
<p>Fallout 76 seems to be in a pretty good place right now. The lasting memory of this game for many will be of its rather rocky launch, but that’s more than six years ago now, and Bethesda has brought a lot of big updates into the mix, and introduced broader ideas, like MMO-style raids and map expansions. It’s not Fallout 5, of course, but similar to The Elder Scrolls Online, it can scratch some of that itch.</p>
<p>Oh man, I bet being a Ghoul is really itchy…</p>

		<p>Just before they presumably clock off for Christmas, GSC Game Worlds has released the first major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. STALKER 2 patch 1.1 promised fixes for over 1,800 issues, including a first set of improvements for the game’s A-Life 2.0 system.</p>
<p>Since launch, A-Life 2.0 has been a major source of disappointment for players of STALKER 2. A-Life is responsible for a fluid game world that’s filled with AI characters and creatures going about their own business, even while a kilometer away from you. There could be factional battles that you never see, regions can change hands or be overrun by mutants overnight, and more. However, GSC seemingly had to make cuts and compromises to the system in order to get STALKER 2 out the door and with a decent frame rate, especially on Xbox Series X|S.</p>


<p>Now A-Life will be more able to spawn and exist in “offline” mode, which is when they’re outside of a player’s visualisation range, being more persistent to run into again later, and more able to take on tasks, like clearing out mutants. It’s a good first step to realising the potential of the system.</p>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (with possible spoilers redacted) for STALKER 2 Patch 1.1:</p>


<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue with spawning NPCs behind the player’s back.</li>
<li>Players can now encounter roaming NPCs across the Zone more often.</li>

<li>Players may now have opportunities to encounter A-Life NPCs they’ve previously met by following in the same direction as the NPCs.</li>

		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>
