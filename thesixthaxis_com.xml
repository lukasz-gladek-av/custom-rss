		<p>THQ Nordic have announced that their new user generated racer, Wreckreation, will be out this October, and dropped a new trailer to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEMB3PehB38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For more on this game, got to preview Wreckreation and speak to Three Fields at Gamescom last year.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/28/wreckreation-preview-the-age-of-the-developer-is-over-the-age-of-the-player-begins-now/" aria-label="“Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”” (Edit)">Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”</a></h2>
<p>Wreckreation takes place in MixWorld, a 400km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;open world setting that combines racing with creation. The ‘live mix’ enables you to build and alter your racing track while you’re racing on it, and while there’s friends in the same space as you. And it’s not just boring old race tracks that are bound by the limits of reality and physics.&nbsp;You can drop audacious loops, ramps into the world, build up into the heavens with race track that arcs through the sky, and throw all manner of crazy props into the mix as well.</p>
<p>As a creation-based racer, Wreckreation will be building on a familiar feeling template for fans of games like ModNation Racers, Trackmania, and even Grand Theft Auto Online, but this will be custom built around the idea of creation within an online open world. It certainly looks different and the console market is screaming out for arcade racers so this should do well.</p>

<p>The game is coming from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/01/26/former-criterion-devs-three-field-entertainment-announce-dangerous-golf/">Three Fields Entertainment, the studio founded by Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward</a> after their departure from Criterion Games in 2014. The pair had led Criterion Games through the creation of their breakout hit Burnout and its sequels, as well as the shift to the Need for Speed franchise in the early 2010s, but when EA decided to downsize Criterion (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/12/need-for-speed-ps5-xbox-series-x-criterion-ghost-games-ea-gothenburg/">a decision they eventually backtracked on</a>), Sperry and Ward went their own way and founded Three Fields Entertainment.</p>
<p>Wreckreation will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on October 28th, 2025.</p>
