		<p>Krafton have announced their plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg/">PUBG</a> which is still going strong after eight years. The big news is at the end of 2025 the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will launch “bringing significant improvements to performance, FPS, map loading speeds, and overall graphical quality.”</p>
<p>“This transition will optimize PUBG for modern hardware, addressing long-standing limitations and enhancing the overall experience for console players,” say Krafton, which does seem to suggest that the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game may be closed down. The game will also move on to Unreal Engine 5 so should look rather nice.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to come, here are a few highlights:</p>
<p><em>Gunplay remains a top priority, with regular balance updates planned throughout the year. Every two months, balance patches will address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. Additionally, an annual large-scale rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage diverse playstyles. Alongside these changes, underutilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and Handguns will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also currently in development, further expanding the arsenal available to players.</em></p>

<p><em>PUBG’s AI system is undergoing a fundamental transformation, making bots behave in a more realistic and strategic manner. AI opponents will react to the shrinking Blue Zone, take cover more effectively, and even deploy smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These enhancements aim to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</em></p>
<p><em>A major world update is planned for the end of the year, transforming existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while maintaining the essence of what players love. Rather than introducing an entirely new map, KRAFTON is reimagining old favorites to offer fresh challenges and strategic opportunities. Additionally, the&nbsp;Destructible Terrain&nbsp;feature is being introduced in Taego, Miramar, and Erangel, further deepening player-world interactions.</em></p>
<p>Along with all of that there will be new guns, new vehicles,&nbsp; and an expansion in Arcade modes and collaborative content.</p>

		<p>Developer Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury have announced The Séance of Blake Manor, a detective game that puts you in a spooky missing person case. Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09m6cxehfFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, developer Spooky Doorway said, <em>“Inspired by Irish Mythology and the spiritualist movements of the Victorian era, The Séance of Blake Manor is depicted by a beautiful comic-book art style and comes to you from the creators of The Darkside Detective. We’ve been working on this for a long time and are delighted to finally share some new updates. You’ll be hearing a lot more about Blake Manor in the weeks and months ahead…”</em></p>
<p>As a detective players will need to question those gathered at Blake Manor, make observations about each individual, search for clues, and uncover the past stories of the manor to really understand what is going on. As clues are gathered, you will need to make logical deductions even with illogical situations popping up to figure out what happened to Evelyn Deane. Time is not on your side either as the minutes will tick by, and the other people will be going about their day. You may miss vital clues if you are not in the right place when a significant event happens.</p>

<p>A release date has not yet been set for The Séance of Blake Manor, and it appears PC is the only platform confirmed.</p>
