		<p>The week has built itself into another UK heatwave, and while I know some people will be loving all the sun, I’m honestly a little bit over all the heatwaves we’ve had this summer. I wouldn’t mind getting back to a bit of slightly drizzly misery for a few weeks. Either way, we’ve been able to stay out of the weather and play plenty of games.</p>
<p>Since previewing the game a little while ago, I’ve been continuing my ground-slapping adventure in Donkey Kong Bananza, which you’ll hear all about when the review embargo lifts before launch next week. I’ve also joined <strong>Miguel</strong> for some tactical SWAT action in Ready or Not… which you’ll also hear about when embargo lifts next week.</p>
<p>So let’s move on rather swiftly from all that secretive stuff and pay a visit to <strong>Steve’s </strong>den of gaming. He’s been playing FromSoftware classic Ninja Blade, initially starting with a German edition of the game before finding the German text unworkable and switching to an English version. “It’s not a good game,” he says, “but by God its one of the most video gamey games to ever game. You haven’t lived until you’ve played a FromSoft game in which a ninja called Ken pulls off a sick kick flip on a missile in mid air.”</p>

<p>He also played through all the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/gex-trilogy-review-the-joy-of-gex/">Gex Trilogy</a> games, dabbled with ReCore to meet his Xbox Rewards box-ticking, and started Space Marine 2 with his co-op buddies, which is “satisfyingly visceral”.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> journey into Switch 2 gaming has seen him playing more Mario Kart World and being impressed by the update to Pokémon Violet – “I can’t stress enough that it’s still not a great game, but at least it works now.” That really was one of the most transformative free Switch 2 patches, I agree.</p>
<p>For <strong>Aran</strong>, he’s been finding Wild Hearts a more relaxed take on the Monster Hunter formula, while Ade has been playing some Eternal Strands, with awesome boss battles wrapped up in by-the-numbers exploration and combat. Oh, and he’s started to review Wuchang: Fallen Feathers which, true to its name, has an awful lot of feathers in it.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> game Blue Prince a try, but “while I like the concept there’s a bit too much cerebral busywork going on. My current casual gaming habits don’t exactly dovetail with roguelike puzzlers that require a healthy attention span and copious notetaking.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been enjoying Islanders: New Shores, which is a city-builder that’s brought some zen state relaxation to her life. “I’ve never reached the top of a gaming leaderboard before so I felt I’d achieved a (slightly sad) life-goal by becoming no.1 on the Islanders: New Shores worldwide leaderboard. It only lasted so long as I was competing with the small number of other pre-release gamers, but I’ll take it!”</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has had a bundle of very different games on the go, with the rhythm-action warfare of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a> getting that game’s chanting lodged in his game once more, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/">Ra Ra Boom</a> having some real beat ’em up potential.</p>

<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played Chains of Freedom and then waves his arms around for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/maestro-review/">Maestro’s</a> review. He’s also played “an ungodly amount of Terraria with three mods that are so big I needed a fourth mod to get them to work together. And then twenty more mods. Then two more mods to improve storage and expand my inventory because there’s so much loot. It’s fantastic.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this past week?</p>

		<p>Kayak VR: Mirage, as we noted in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/21/kayak-vr-mirage-psvr-2-review/">our original review</a>, is a rather minimalist experience. Sure, there’s a competitive mode where you can race against ghosts of other players, but you can also just jump in a Kayak and pootle around some stunningly gorgeous locations and relax. In his review, Stefan also commented, “For me, though, I was left wanting something more […] a kayak slalom in the whitewater rapids.” It appears developers Better Than Life – who win all the points for that Red Dwarf VR reference – were listening, as that’s exactly what you get in the Yucatán DLC pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kayak VR: Mirage - Yucatán DLC (including whitewater) | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAAGWaM0Fxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The level begins in a lagoon surrounded on all sides by high cliffs that are covered in tropical vegetation. It is stunning to look at; I have been lucky enough to go to places like this and it does feel real with birds flying around and fish swimming under your kayak. As I was playing this in London during a heatwave, I was suitably hot and humid as well. Sadly, this gorgeous location is not indicative of what you get to play as the rest of the level is set in caves and an old mine.</p>



<p>The first section is very sedate and has you paddling through a few tunnels, ducking down now and then to avoid the cave roof, before things open up into a large cavern full of stalactites and stalagmites, all of which are lit by glowworms crawling up the walls. It’s very pretty and looks like something from a fantasy game, but a quick paddle sees you heading into more caves, which gradually turn into tunnels from an old mine. There’s almost a puzzle element to this section as you paddle through a maze with rockfalls crashing down around you, blocking what seems to be the obvious route.</p>

<p>Eventually the tunnels widen out to another larger cave and the water begins to flow faster, pushing you forward and into, you you guessed it, more tunnels! As the pace picks up have to be alert as the game throws all sorts of obstacles at you, narrowing the passages so you have to lean to squeeze through and even that video game staple, giant fans blade that slice through the water. However, as the game is rated E for Everyone, don’t expect a gory decapitation if you smash in to a slicing blade, you just bump off and can have another try.</p>

<p>And that’s about it. It’s a short and sweet experience, twenty minutes from end to end if you paddle at a decent pace. There’s a time attack mode where you can race ghosts of other players and a tour mode in which you can sit back and let the Kayak navigate itself through the map, the same as the other maps in game.</p>
<p>The cave system is completely different to other locations in the game, which are all set in wide open areas, and this change adds some variety to your paddling, but it does mean you don’t get the majestic views found in other locations. You also have to rely on a head mounted torch for some sections and, like all torches in all video games, it’s weaker than a cup of tea made by an American.</p>
<p>The Yucatán DLC is definitely worth a look if you already own Kayak VR: Mirage as it does bring something new to the game, but I think I preferred some of the other locations which were less enclosed and allowed you to marvel at how gorgeous VR can look.</p>
