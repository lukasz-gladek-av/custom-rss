		<p>Resolution Games has announced a release date for their upcoming digital boardgame crossover, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. The game will be launching across PC, PS5, PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 on 20th November, with a demo arriving in time for Steam Next Fest on 13th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kasgPB71yLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While it’s a contender for one of the most word salad-y game names of the year, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked – DxD&amp;D:B for short – is an exciting combination of the digital tabletop adventuring of Demeo and the themes and familiar setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. injecting more narrative and things to do between quests. That said, the main focus is really on combat and not the broader adventuring of either video game or tabletop D&amp;D.</p>
<p>The gameplay trailer showcases some of these, so characters now have skill tree upgrades to work through, you can visit a tavern and grab side quests, and of course the dice system has become D20-based (albeit with simplified icons so you don’t have to cross reference numbers)</p>
<p>Available from 13th to 20th October, the demo will provide players with two quests from the game’s first campaign, and let you explore some of the bespoke characters and their classes. You’ve got the dragonborn paladin, Bolthrax; the halfling sorcerer, Tibby; the human ranger Jessix; and the tiefling rogue, Ash. Two more characters – the dwarven fighter Tharok and elf bard Lyria – will be available in the full game.</p>

<p>The demo, just as with the full game, will be playable solo or with up to four players, taking on a goblin ambush in Neverwinter Wood and then explore a Myconid colony where the typically-serene fungi have become suspiciously hostile.</p>
<p>Playing the demo and defeating both quests will reward players of the full game with two special skins for the Battlemarked 20-sided dice.</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">the original Demeo</a>, it was one of my favourite games from the PSVR 2 launch, and I said, “Demeo is a fun and accessible digital board game, evoking games like HeroQuest with its turn-based dungeon-crawling. In VR it’s a pleasingly tactile experience that’s great to share with co-op friends, but if you need or prefer to play on a TV screen? Well that’s still good too.”</p>

		<p>Sometimes, you get to take joy in everything new and fresh. In experiences that you’ve never previously imagined.&nbsp; Other times, it’s the known, the cosy, the comfortable that invites you in like a long-lost friend. So it is today, with the latest release from Plaion Replai, where they invite you to ‘Unlock 1982’, with the announcement of physical re-releases of old-school classics Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig-Dug and Xevious for the Atari 2600+ and Atari 7800+, all of which are fully compatible with the original Atari 7800.</p>
<p><iframe title="GALAGA, PAC-MAN Double Feature, DIG DUG, XEVIOUS | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhmXfUCePf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>1982 was the year that arcade gaming really hit its stride, with all four of these classic titles arriving in the space of 12 months. Admittedly, a good proportion of people reading this probably weren’t alive – or perhaps only just – in 1982, but if you’re a fan of gaming you won’t have escaped the long term legacy of each of these games. Heck, a new Pac-Man game came out last week!</p>
<p>Details of the four games can be found here:</p>
<p><b>GALAGA – Alien Swarm Attack!</b><br>
Defend your starfighter against endless waves of alien attackers in one of the greatest arcade shooters of all time.&nbsp; Rescue captured ships, unleash dual-fighter firepower, and prove yourself in a timeless battle for the high score.</p>

<p><b>PAC-MAN Double Feature – Two Games. One Legend.</b><br>
The world’s most famous maze-chaser returns in a special double feature: the classic Atari 2600 release alongside the upgraded Atari 7800 edition.&nbsp; Outsmart Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in two definitive versions of PAC-MAN.</p>
<p><b><span lang="SV">Dig Dug – Dig Deep. Pump Fast!</span></b><span lang="SV"><br>
</span>Grab your pump and tunnel underground in Namco’s quirky action-puzzler.&nbsp; Trap enemies, inflate them until they pop, or crush them with rocks in a unique blend of strategy and arcade action.</p>
<p><b>Xevious – Blast the Sky. Bomb the Earth.</b><br>
Pilot the Solvalou fighter in one of the most influential vertical shooters ever made.&nbsp; Master dual attacks – lasers for airborne enemies, bombs for ground targets, and uncover hidden secrets as you battle for humanity’s survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games aren’t just nostalgic releases, they’re cultural touchstones,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Ben Jones, Commercial Director of PLAION REPLAI.&nbsp;&nbsp;“With GALAGA as our flagship, and PAC-MAN, Dig Dug, and Xevious completing the set, we’re celebrating 1982 as the year that defined the golden age of arcades.&nbsp; We want fans old and new to unlock that moment in time and experience it all over again on Atari consoles.”</p>

			<p>LEGO Voyagers might just be the cutest game ever. As my partner and I guided our adorable single-block Lego pieces though this co-op puzzle platformer, we emitted many a coo of ‘ooohhhh’ and ‘aaahhhh’, and thankfully it wasn’t followed by running and screaming. But is there more to Light Brick Studios’ latest LEGO adventure than looking disarmingly delightful?</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idgrndka0AQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Akin to the local and online co-op experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">offered by Hazelight Studios</a>, Lego Voyagers requires two players to work together to navigate through its isometric levels. Your eyed Lego pieces are steered like rolling wagon wheels, tumbling through the environment with clumsy abandon. Most of the levels are made up of those smooth Lego pieces that are much easier to dust on your display models than the studded ones. Though, every now and again, you’ll find some studs to attach to with the tap of a button. Like Katamari Damacy, you can end up coated in chunks of plastic, each impacting the physics of your character, causing you to trundle hilariously – and precariously – around the place.</p>


<p>Even better, both players can connect together with a stupendously satisfying ‘click’, and then can both take control of your Frankenstein-like Lego monstrosity, requiring you to work together to get around the place. It’s tremendous silly fun, and, thanks to a very quick respawn, frustration caused by the chaos is kept to an absolute minimum. Having said that, despite the kid friendly visuals, I can’t help but feel that the challenging physics-based controls might not make this one suitable to play with the smallest Lego-fans in your family.</p>


<p>Platforming is simple, which is a relief, as the isometric viewpoint prevents anything more complex. Even simple jumps are made agonisingly tricky by often being unable to tell where your player character is in the space. Once more, that aforementioned rapid respawn saves the day. Even if you’ve failed a basic jump several times or more, you’re hurled back into the action before irritation sets in.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hit and miss platforming, the puzzles are a delight, requiring both players to work together to solve numerous satisfyingly brain-ticking conundrums. One player might be tasked with controlling a bridge say, whilst the other player crosses it safely – or unsafely, if the first player is feeling cheeky. In my case, I often am.</p>
<p>The best puzzles are those that involve building something together from the random bits and bobs you find littered around the landscape. Often, you don’t quite know what you are building until suddenly the penny drops and you realise, you’re halfway through constructing a catapult to haphazardly fling your buddy over a hazardous ravine! Or, in a page straight out of Hazelight Studios’ co-op book, you’re tasked with controlling a boat together, one playing steering, the other accelerating. It’s easy charming fun, the game breezily flinging ideas at you, never waiting too long before moving onto the next one.</p>

<p>The only downside? It’s all over far too quickly. As such, it never quite feels like the game explores any one idea to a satisfying conclusion. You do a bit of something, it’s enjoyable, but it always feels like the mechanic could be further explored. Light Brick Studios clearly doesn’t want to stick with an idea too long, just in case you get bored. This, combined with a very short run time of a handful of hours, means that whilst Lego Voyagers is tremendous fun, it’s likely done and forgotten before the end credits have finished rolling.</p>
