		<p>Arrowhead has announced that the Helldivers will have a new objective to deal with from September 2nd, which is when Helldivers 2: Into the Unjust will launch. These new missions will take players deep into the Terminid Hive Worlds where there will be new missions to beat, and new enemies to push back in locations that will be creeping with all sorts of creatures.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Into the Unjust Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJi8VsvnkoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Hive Worlds have been shrouded by the Gloom, so it is time to lift the veil and shoot at whatever is hidden by it. Locations will include huge towers to scale and caverns deep underground where you and your squad could be hit at any time. Arrowhead has stated that when you are in the caverns there will be no Super Destroyer support, meaning it is just your squad and whatever weapons you can carry. Some of the new creatures that will be encountered on the Hive Worlds include variants of Terminid Warriors and Bile Spewers, along with Chargers that will dig underground and emerge in front of its enemies, aka you. There is also the new Dragonroach creature which flies and fires down burning bile. Arrowhead has stated there are other creatures which players will discover for themselves. The new missions include escorting an oil rig across the planet’s surface, and destroying Hive Lungs in the caverns below. New additional objectives will be added to Helldivers 2 for Into the Unjust too.</p>
<p>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond will also be available from September 2nd, and it will include:</p>
