		<p>I hope you’ve got a bowl of sweets ready to go by the front door and fend off sugar seeking children tonight, because the final (un)death throes of October are here for Halloween. If you’re expecting small, spookily dressed guests to come knocking, it’s going to make any concerted gaming sessions tonight a bit tricky to get into until they’ve all gone home.</p>
<p>To get into the mood, my gaming this week has been dominated by the dense Grand Strategy of Europa Universalis V, with a review for that later today, but there’s also been the odd game of Battlefield 6 in there as well. I’m not as vociferous about it, but having a battle pass, battle royale and more shoved into it has taken a little bit of the shine off. I can generally just go and play the modes I want and be unbothered by it.</p>

<p>As for everyone else, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played some Sweet Surrender and Painkiller for review, and returned to Atomfall for its second DLC and “complete edition” patch, which you’ll read about in a little while. There was also as some Alan Wake 2 and Ball x Pit for the sake of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The most football-y lad among us, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Football Manager 26 and Umami for review. He has some good news and some bad news about the former of these, already sharing his thoughts on the game’s early access beta, which is laying the foundations for a bright new era, but maybe isn’t quite there yet.</p>


<p><strong>Miguel</strong> burst into the chat with a boisterous “oy whots all this then!!!” before more calmly informing us that he’s been playing Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, plus a new online shooter RPG called Duet Night Abyss. Then he’s also been dabbling in a little bit of Silent Hill f and Tekken 3.</p>
<p>While Miguel loved Ninja Gaiden 4, <strong>Ade’s</strong> found that “it’s good but the combat gets oddly grindy and repetitive after a while, so I’ve discovered I enjoy the game more in short doses. Shows you really can have too much of a good thing!”</p>
<p>While his opinions of Pokémon Legends: Z-A have remained “controversial” through his continued playtime – as in, he really likes it, and won’t apologise – Nic has broken out the Ring Fit Adventure ring to help get a little cardio in.</p>

<p><strong>Steven</strong> made what he claims to be a fatal mistake by installing PowerWash Simulator 2, “which has consumed my life much as the first one did, leaving a pile of recent purchases and other games struggling to get a look in…” Doesn’t sound particularly fatal to me, especially as he’s started playing Tormented Souls 2, and has plans for a bunch more indie horror games thihs weekend, “although a large part of it will see me meditatively soaping the filth from a range of imaginative objects and locations.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Battlefield 6, having finally put the turgid single player campaign behind him, and been enjoying Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks “which, despite the 40K shenanigans, could be the best car combat I’ve played in many long years.”</p>
<p>And with <strong>Dom</strong> swanning off on holiday for half term, he remembered to pack his Switch 2, so he’s been playing&nbsp;Mario Kart World, Hyrule Warriors, Plants vs. Zombies, and Lumines Arise!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you all played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Horror fans are truly spoiled at the moment. Hot on the heels of the fantastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">Silent Hill f</a> we are now excitedly waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">the latest in Capcom’s legendary Resident Evil</a> series. But the wait shouldn’t be bereft of awesome horror games as indie developers are producing titles of superb quality. Recent classics like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, The Mute House, and Dead of Darkness are all great choices if you’ve not played them yet, but with Halloween tonight, we’re right in the middle of a flourish of horrifying highlights. So many games are coming out that I’m not going to be able to fully cover them with reviews so here’s what’s going to be keeping me busy in my personal gaming time over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p>I’m working on a review for this sequel to the cult classic original, which launched last week. That game really captured the feel and challenge of survival horror whilst also adding some unique twists of its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tormented Souls 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qstF5gZ-Zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The second game continues this and adds an extra layer of polish on top. The combat remains refreshingly hard and the puzzles often require some lateral thinking whilst the narrative is dark and full of mystery. This is an easy recommend but my full review should be up next week.</p>

<h2>Painted in Blood</h2>
<p>Out now in Early Access, Painted in Blood offers a more action packed first person perspective and feels like the fusion of classic survival horror atmosphere and the Painkiller series. The clear Boomer Shooter influence makes this title stand out amongst the more traditional fixed camera games that populate this list and the look and feel of the game only cement this as a stand out title</p>
<p><iframe title="Painted In Blood - Early Access Launch Trailer (Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmSk5OtKHPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Silly Polly Beast</h2>
<p>Strange name aside, this recently released title has a striking visual style and unique identity, taking part through multiple camera perspective and playstyles. The titular Polly escapes from her orphanage prison and finds herself trapped in Hell. As she makes her way through she encounters many demons and otherworldy creatures who can be friend or foe whilst learning magic spells to unleash her full strength and potential.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Silly Polly Beast ► Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBwVIzD5t40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Flesh Made Fear</h2>
<p>One of two classic fixed camera angle survival horror games scheduled to release today, on Halloween itself, Flesh Made Fear brings grindhouse visuals and sensibilities to the genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Flesh Made Fear - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxDBVgIlp44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The atmosphere reminds me of horror films like Night of the Living Dead as your group of special forces operatives find themselves stranded in the nightmarish Rotwood Forest in search of the sinister Victor Ripper, a mad scientist whose experiments have turned the town into a horrific mix of mutations and occult rituals. The demo for this showed a real understanding of the genre whilst promising some new twists and I’m excited to start it as soon as I can.</p>
<h2>Echoes of the Living</h2>
<p>The other Halloween release is a game I’ve been following for years since the first announcement and early demos. Echoes of the Living is a ridiculously polished looking project from a husband and wife dev team that absolutely nails the Resident Evil 2 vibe with alternating characters and routes through a city at the mercy of a zombie virus. This has been up there with the new Silent Hills and Resident Evils in my most wanted list and its upcoming release is a testament to the passion of indie developers in this genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living | Early Access Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZYvJvttIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<hr>
<p>If this isn’t enough horror to tide you over, then the releases keep coming. While dates aren’t yet confirmed, the following games have demos or playtests to try out before adding them to your wishlist.</p>
<h2>Becrowned</h2>
<p>Becrowned is another game that I have been following closely for a while now, with each demo showcasing the progression of a title that promises a fusion of Silent Hill and Resident Evil. The most recent demo features the beginning of the game and offers a glimpse of the psychological horror it contains. The surreal and dream-like atmosphere sees your player character, Richard Torrance, venture through a range of locations in a purgatorial quest to unravel the nature of his imprisonment in such a nightmare.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BECROWNED ► New Demo Release Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19qxr_XnEJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Pinnacle Point</h2>
<p>Like many other games in this list, Pinnacle Point takes clear inspiration from the two main survival horror juggernauts but also adds in some Alan Wake to the equation. You play as Aron, a troubled scientist returning to the location of a world changing experiment to find his brother who he left behind.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pinnacle Point - Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RpaEkjQtcQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The island of Pinnacle Point stays in Aron’s dreams and calls out to him, leading him into a world of twisted mutations and cosmic horror. Shadowy foes are protected by a radiation field that must be disrupted before they can be hurt, with the mechanic playing out similarly to the torch and gun approach of Alan Wake.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even this list isn’t exhaustive, with promising titles such as Kingdom of Night, SSR Wives: The Murder of My Winter Crush, Welcome to Doll Town, Wicked Seed, Shutter Story, Project Songbird, Withering Realms, and the recently announced Darkwood 2 all due over the next year or so. There’s almost certainly more titles that I’ve forgotten as the new golden age of indie horror continues to offer terrifying delights.</p>

		<p>Chief Rebel has announced a small patch for its multiplayer online PvE dungeon game Fellowship, which addresses some issues raised in a previous patch and introduces some rebalances and fixes. The game will be down while the patch is applied. Fellowship is currently in early access on Steam, which the development team expect to last for around six months. The early access version of Fellowship has nine heroes to choose from and a selection of dungeons to fight through.</p>
