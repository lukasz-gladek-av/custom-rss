		<p>Merry Switchmas, one and all. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came out yesterday, so there’s been a burst of activity here, as those of us who have the latest Nintendo console in hand have got to playing a whole bunch of Mario Kart World, and checking out all the other games, new and old, that are on the system.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been the most-played game of mine on Switch 2, I’ve been bouncing back and forth between what feels like countless other games. I’m having to write down and keep track what I’m playing for the purposes of comparisons back to last gen.</p>
<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> been doing the same. alongside Mario Kart World, he’s quickly spun out reviews of the excellent anti-grav racer Fast Fusion, ran through Welcome Tour, and gave a middling review of “the game of waiting for the delivery person on Thursday.”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> has not been playing Switch 2, “because nobody bought me one, very rude”, and since he doesn’t feel like sharing beyond that, we’ll move right along to Gamoc, who finished Split Fiction with his sister last night, “which is still mechanically brilliant, though it’s story doesn’t do as well.” There’s also been Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, and the newly launched Atomfall DLC for a review sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been working on Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon for a review coming next week, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> had The Alters on the go for review as well.</p>
<p>Digging back through Resident Evil, <strong>Jim</strong> played through the Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village, “which offers a bizarre detour from the main game that supposedly sets up the next arc in the series.” He found it quite unsettling at times with the creepy mannequins. He also played some of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/">Nioh 3 demo</a>, which is a big evolution over past games, taking a bit of inspiration from Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As is tradition, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing many, many demos and will have a recommendation post up ready for the start of Next Fest. He also hopes to be joining the Switch 2-athon later today, but what else has he played? “I also enjoyed rattling through Spray Paint Simulator on Game Pass before making the perhaps unwise decision to start Metaphor: ReFantazio as if I have time for another huge JRPG at the moment..</p>

<p>Another Switch acolyte is <strong>Nic</strong>, but for him Mario Kart has been joined by Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and there’s Magic: The Gathering, of course.</p>
<p>There’s no Switch 2 for <strong>Miguel</strong>, but he’s played a few games that are on it, namely Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review/">Fantasy Life i</a>, joining those with Zenless Zone Zero and Elden Ring Nightrein.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tuffcub</strong> has made a start on our Death Stranding 2 review. That’s all he can say for now…</p>
<p>But what have you been playing this week?</p>

		<p>For almost a decade Japanese developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> has been hot on the heels of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>, the studio behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, and indeed the wider “Soulslike” genre. Many have tried to replicate and remix that formula to varying levels of success, Team Ninja being the most dogged and consistent in that pursuit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>2017’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> ticked all the boxes, including brutal skill-based combat, a dark oppressive world, and a satisfying risk/reward progression, while adding its own kinetic combat touches. After all, these are the guys who developed the 3D <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series. Since then, the studio has put its name to a successive string of Souslike games including <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, each wrapping that familiar action RPG core with new and interesting design ideas.</p>


<p>Announced during Sony’s recent State of Play broadcast, Nioh 3 doesn’t require you to have played the two previous games in the series, even if that might help. It may share the same setting and core gameplay design, but this isn’t a continuous story. As a lone warrior destined to become Shogun, you enter a world gripped by a bloody conflict as Japanese warlords vye for power amidst a demonic Yokai invasion.</p>
<p>The Nioh series has always excelled in blending elements of mythology and folklore with real-world history, giving the games a distinct identity that is equal parts grim and enchanting. Once idyllic landscapes are now wreathed in a pulsating aura of corruption as a menagerie of spirits, beasts, and other monstrosities predate upon the remaining pockets of humanity who have yet to succumb to war.</p>


<p>Nioh fans will immediately feel at home, though there are some new gameplay quirks that take some getting used to. Players will notice that the main character is more agile and dynamic in their movements – something carried forward from Wo Long and the more recent Rise of the Ronin. They can double jump and dodge in mid-air, adding a greater sense of verticality to Nioh’s combat and exploration.</p>
<p>Another major new gameplay feature allows the player to seamlessly switch between Samurai and Ninja playstyles, both with their own unique abilities, movesets, and equipment loadouts. Where the Samurai is more defence-focused with hard-hitting charged attacks the Ninja is capable of running rings around sluggish opponents, delivering a flurry of attacks before using their Mist evade to fall back. Naturally, players are likely to gravitate towards one of playstyle, though Team Ninja makes an argument for using both to suit different combat scenarios.</p>
<p>Nioh 3’s evolution doesn’t stop there. With FromSoftware having broken the bonds of its traditional “open linear” level design with Elden Ring’s open world, Nioh was bound to follow suit. Again, we got a taste of this in Rise of the Ronin, and at first it can be a little disorientating. Nioh 3’s opening stage serves as a tight-knit tutorial, allowing newcomers and veterans to cut their teeth on a few skirmishes before squaring up to a tough first boss – a member of Takeda Shingen’s Crimson Cavalry.</p>

<p>However, it isn’t long before players are unleashed upon a vast new landscape that stretches in just about every direction. Although there’s a gleaming icon on the HUD compass, players are invited to forge their own path, discovering hidden treasures, completing side quests, and stumbling upon horrific enemies they have no chance of defeating. The Shrines dotted throughout act as resting points where you can replenish items, trade goods, and funnel resources into boosting various stats and skills, enabling a multitude of build possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-revealed-for-ps5-with-a-demo-available-today/">Playing the Nioh 3 alpha demo</a> it’s clear to see how ambitious the scope of this game is, building on countless gameplay innovations and experiments Team Ninja has developed across its stable of recent action RPGs. It’s not just bigger, it’s deeper and more layered, instantly becoming one of our most anticipated PlayStation 5 games of 2026.</p>
