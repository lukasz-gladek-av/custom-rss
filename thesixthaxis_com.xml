		<p>While big blockbuster games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and Call of Duty pull in huge audience numbers, there are games that quietly ramp up the player numbers without entering the global consciousness. That’s definitely the case for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046300/Pirates_Outlaws/">Pirates Outlaws</a>, a game which racked up an astounding 3 million downloads, while accruing over 30,000 positive reviews on Android. Fans will be happy to find that not only will the sequel, Pirate Outlaws 2: Heritage, be sailing to iOS, Android and PC later in 2025, but they can already test out its roguelike deckbuilding charms via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025160/Pirates_Outlaws_2_Heritage/">brand new demo that’s just dropped on Steam</a>.</p>
