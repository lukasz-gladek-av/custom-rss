		<p>I can happily say that a further week with the Switch 2 is cementing it as my current console of choice. I’ve been playing a lot of Splatoon 3, which I think I’m doing alright at, or just being very lucky with my teammates. It remains a great game, and having cooled on my Overwatch obsession, it’s filling the competitive shooter void in my life. Besides that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/27/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review/">Ruffy and the Riverside</a>, which is a delightful throwback to the days of the N64, as well as Lost In Random: The Eternal Die, more family Mario Kart World, and more Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has had a frustrating week, but one with some romance in it, telling us, “After a particularly gruelling boss fight in Clair Obscur which I found intensely irritating – so much so my controller almost got lobbed, something I’ve not done in decades – so I took a break from all that stress by reviewing the sand-box dating sim <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/date-everything-review/">Date Everything</a>&nbsp;and succeeded in seducing my lamp. So that’s nice.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> had a busy one this week, saying, “In addition to Atomfall, Maestro, Zombie Army VR, and Chains of Freedom for review, I also started Death Stranding. I also did a sci-fi DND one-shot that I based on a book over the weekend, which was cool.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> was on <em>BIG REVIEW DUTY</em> this week with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">Death Stranding 2</a>. He says it’s got it all wrong though, “Death Stranding 2: Not On The Beach At All The Title Is Very Misleading. I have also played Sand Land, which I later found out is based on a manga, it’s rather fun.” See, at least that one sounds like it is on a beach.</p>


<p>Spending a good chunk of time playing Split/Second from the PlayStation Plus classics streaming library, Jim says, “It’s still a sublime arcade racer that doesn’t pull its punches with cheap rubber banding – then, of course, there’s the massively destructible tracks. I’m having great fun and will definitely complete a playthrough of the campaign before not doubt going back and grabbing 1st place in tougher races using the game’s best motors.” He continues, “After dipping in and out of the game for what feels like multiple years, I also wrapped Valiant Hearts. It transported me back in time, not just to The Great War, but a time when Ubisoft were taking more risks and banging out some stellar, smaller-scale titles.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/">Rematch</a>, saying, “It is fine but needs a community where players know how to pass. I also played a Contra inspired run and gun game called Wild Dogs which let’s you use pilot a mech suit with a dog. I’ve also started Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins, and the combat is good in that. I’ve also started I Am Your Beast for review.”</p>
<p>Going for something gaming adjacent, <strong>Nic B</strong> tells us, “I have finally had a chance to catch up on Final Fantasy in Magic the Gathering. It is very, very good.” Meanwhile, <strong>Miguel</strong> has played lots of Elden Ring: Nightrein, a bit of Peak, and the global release of Umamusume: Pretty Derby.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> tried out The Alters, but says, “I found it got too stressful as I kept on running out of food so will return to that when I’m feeling up to it.’ He then joined me by starting Lost In Random: The Eternal Die which he thinks is, “A really fun Hades clone that’s well worth playing on Game Pass”. He’s been carrying on though with his path to Metroid Prime 4, telling us, “I’m deep into the incredible fanmade AMR2. I played Samus Returns back on the 3DS and that was mostly a matter of parrying so playing an alternative take on Metroid 2 that doesn’t have this mechanic feels very different. It is still a bit too easy to get lost as many essential areas are hidden in secret rooms.” Finally, he started exploring the Switch 2 Welcome Tour and played a few rounds of Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has played a bunch of upcoming games. He went hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">Pragmata</a> just hours before the gameplay reveal in last night’s Capcom Spotlight stream, and really enjoyed the unusual hacking minigame being thrown into the shooting. He also visited Raw Fury to check out a bunch of their upcoming games, already sharing impressions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters Are Coming!</a>, and with Esoteric Ebb and more to come soon. He was then complimented on some a Mario Kart World win by an onlooking stranger on the flight back home.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</em></p>

		<p>While the Mortal Kombat movies seem to be happy with casting lesser known actors the new Street Fighter movie seems to be following the pattern set by the 1994 movie, which had wacky stunt casting with Jean Claude Van Damme facing against Australian pop princess, Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>Here’s the cast for the new Street Fighter movie so far:</p>


<ul>
<li>Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson should need no introduction and he will be playing Balrog, which seems a good fit.</li>
<li>Jason Momoa will be playing Blanka. Mr. Momao while muscly, is is notably not a hulk, and also not green, so how this is going to work remains to be seen.</li>
<li>Noah Centineo is a teen idol over in the United States but over here in the UK you may remember him (and I’m being generous here) as Atom Smasher in the Black Adam movie.</li>
<li>Andrew Koji is a British actor who specialise in martials art. You may have seen him as Storm Shadow in Snake Eyes and Yuichi “The Father” Kimura in the excellent Bullet Train, and he will be playing Ryu.</li>
<li>Orville Peck, the gay country and western singer, will be playing Vega. This is genius casting, Vega is camp as tits. Also it links back to the original movie as Orville and Kylie recently released a single together, so Vega and Cammy can duet!</li>
<li>Joe Anoa’i will be more familiar to you as WWE superstar Roman Reign, and he has been cast as Akuma.</li>
<li>Callina Liang is a Canadian actress best known for Steven Soderbergh’s Presence her role in the ITVX teen drama Tell Me Everything.</li>
<li>Andrew Schulz is the latest casting, the American stand-up comedian, actor, and podcaster, will be playing a lesser know character, Dan Hibiki.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kitao Sakurai will be directing the movie, his previous directing credits include the 2021 Netflix film Bad Trip… and that’s it.</p>
<p>It is said that the cast are already in training, although there is no word on a script yet.</p>
