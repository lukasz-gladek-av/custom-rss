		<p>Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch was pretty naff, let’s be honest. A remarkable achievement, but one that was inevitably heavily compromised just to get it running at the low level that it managed. By contrast, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is a huge accomplishment that captures so much more of the tone and feel of the game on PS5, Xbox Series X or PC that it feels so much more worth playing.</p>

<p>This is a brand-new port of the game to Nintendo Switch, retaining none of the heavy compromises that were needed to work on Switch, and making its own adjustments to match the new hardware platform’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>


<p>The difference is night and day, though. The often very flat lighting and shading of the interior of Hogwarts on Nintendo Switch is replaced by the rich light and dark of more realistic internal lighting and illumination. This is one of the key areas where the game gets much closer to the game on PS5.</p>

<p>To me, that is one of the most impactful changes, but there’s so many other changes that were made for the game on Switch that have effectively been reverted for Switch 2. It’s everything from how thick the grass looks on the ground with the draw distance, to the variety of fidelity of the trees in the grounds around Hogwarts, the shadows that things cast.</p>

<p>It’s seriously impressive.</p>

<p>Alongside this has come a general gameplay experience that better matches the game on PS5. Where Switch 1 had loading transitions to get into Hogsmeade and to walk into shops, Switch 2 is able to get back to the style of PS5, where the doors all just feel like they’re a bit haunted and slow to respond –&nbsp;most noticeable at major area transitions.</p>
<p>Flying around on a broomstick has also been sped back up, the faster storage and larger amount of RAM in the Switch 2 allowing for dynamic loading to keep up better. It’s one of those things you might notice most in side-by-side comparisons, or if you ever compare your records for time trials.</p>
<p>On a simplistic level, Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is able to hold onto a 30fps target very well, Running through Hogwarts grounds on the path to Hogsmeade is basically just locked to 30fps, and when you reach Hogsmeade itself, you don’t have a loading screen like on Switch 1 and can just run straight into the tight village streets where, once again, performance is great.</p>

<p>Really, the main issues we’ve found have been with instances of loading stutter when coming up to the hidden loading screens at doors between areas –&nbsp;which when Hogwarts itself is a maze of doors and courtyards, does add frequent little blips, in addition to some pop-in and the fade of new lighting conditions. Flying around on a broom also leads to poor frame pacing, so this introductory time trial, for example, is 30fps, but it feels more juddery than it should be.</p>
<p>In any case, this all makes for a much more pleasant experience than the Switch 1, which can pretty much never maintain its 30fps target. Just running through the halls dips to the mid-20s, and the broom flying is seriously taxing for the system, such that this port slowed down the speed of flight to try and keep up.</p>
<p>You can, of course, play the Switch 1 port on Switch 2 via backward compatibility, and this does make it much more palatable. Dynamic resolutions will be better (though I’d argue still not exactly good), and the frame rate does steady up to 30fps, but there’s bad frame pacing here when running to Hogsmeade in particular. I guess Shiver Entertainment who did this Switch 1 port didn’t feel the need to look at this when they had much bigger problems!</p>
<p>Of course, even 30fps is a big step back from what is possible on PS5 and other more powerful platforms. They have graphics performance options, ranging from 30fps fidelity and ray tracing modes, through a standard 60fps performance mode and even a higher frame rate mode.</p>

<p>The main comparison, to my mind, would be from Switch 2 to PS5 performance mode. Not the max fidelity or performance, but the safe middle-ground. With this, you definitely notice some of the compromises still being made for Switch 2. And…. well, honestly you don’t even need to make this comparison to see how the Switch 2 relies on lower resolutions and upscaling to get the job done. The key area that always grabs my attention is when in the dialogue scenes and you can see the low resolution hair with jaggies and floating isolated strands. The diffuse reflections on shiny walls and floors through Hogwarts also have much more of a speckled look at you get to the ends, though intriguingly, it does seem that there are more of these reflections by default on Switch 1, vs. performance mode on PS5.</p>

<p>However, in general, this is an incredibly impressive new port of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, there are of course compromises, but it really captures the look and feel of the original game release that makes it feel of that generation, and not like the necessarily cut down port of the original Switch.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to see that, while this is new work, Warner Bros. is offering upgrade pricing. If you own the game on Switch 1, you can access a DLC from the game’s main menu to enable a discount price for the full Switch 2 game to bring it down to $10 or £8.50. This could have been made more obvious with a Switch 2 Edition style release, but has the major benefit that you won’t need the Switch 1 cartridge to play anymore, if you’re coming from a physical copy. For one of the biggest generational leaps you’ll ever likely see, that’s a bargain, but it’s also just a nice good faith upgrade in general.</p>

<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a great port for Nintendo Switch 2, and another great showcase of how the console can punch above its weight.</p>

			<p>I’m a massive fan of&nbsp;TRON, but more specifically, I’m a massive fan of TRON: Legacy. The 2010 sci-fi sequel has been cemented in my subconscious since the day it came out. The world it built has always been so captivating to me, with sleek metal obelisks and neon colorized highlights dancing around in my dreams most nights. It’s all complemented by gripping audio design, from the roar of the light cycles to the zap of a bouncing identity disc and the iconic Daft Punk&nbsp;curated score. Every opportunity I get to revisit that world is a thrill, so I’ve been chomping at the bit to get my hands on the latest spinoff of my favorite sci-fi property –&nbsp;TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrt-GkCO-ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it doesn’t have a number in the title, TRON: Catalyst pretty much a direct follow-up to Bithell Games’ 2023 visual novel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tron-identity">TRON: Identity</a>. The two titles make a really complementary pair and, after rolling credits on this latest release, it’s clear they’re aiming to continue this story further with a third entry. TRON: Catalyst focuses our sights on Exo, a program working as a courier in the virtual city of Vertical_Slice who lands in hot water when her last delivery of the night ends up being an explosive device that goes off in her hands. She makes it out alive, but not unaffected. Whatever she was tasked to deliver ended up giving her the ability to Glitch, which lets her rewind time to an earlier point whenever she chooses. Hunting for answers on why she can do this and who’s responsible lands her in the middle of a plot of resistance and uprising, and a race against the clock to stop a Glitch storm from wiping out the entire system.</p>


<p>Mechanically, the glitch ability is a lot less exciting than it sounds. I’m a sucker for a good time-loop game, but it needs to smartly loop that concept equally through the narrative and the gameplay. TRON: Catalyst doesn’t strike that balance. Your hand is often held tightly by the game as your objects guide you on when to press the loop button to reset the current chapter, retaining your obtained info and abilities to progress down a new path. Despite the illusion of dialogue choices and branching exploration, the entire experience is incredibly linear, never once feeling like you have the ability to shape any outcomes yourself.</p>


<p>Despite the middling use of time-loop gameplay, I was still in awe getting to run around the world of TRON and explore such lovingly crafted locales. The dense Iso-populated cities and barren, green-tinted Outlands perfectly matched my memories of them from other TRON properties, and the pink-tinted Automata add a new element to the mix that I loved exploring. You’re given iconic tools like the Identity Disc and a Lightcycle to play around with, too.</p>
<p>Tossing and slicing your disc plays out in pretty basic real-time combat, with a skill-tree that helps expand your abilities. It’s hardly the focus of the game or it’s strongest suit, but it helps break up the exploration heavy segments that occupy the rest of the game. Lightcycle chases and battles, on the other hand, are a delight. The top-down viewpoint of the game never properly captures the sense of speed you’d hope for from these moments, but the battles are so satisfying and I could honestly see myself getting lost in a mode that was nothing but those bike battles for hours, if it was on offer.</p>

<p>If there’s one element of TRON: Catalyst that actively disappointed me, though, it was the soundtrack. A major part of the modern identity for the TRON franchise is it’s music. TRON: Legacy introduced us to the electronic and orchestral fusion of Daft Punk excellence that has gone on to influence the music of every spin-off title since then, and the upcoming TRON: Ares film promises to carve out an equally exciting audio identity for itself with a soundtrack composed by Nine Inch Nails. TRON: Catalyst fails to ignite the same excitement that most Tron music does, its score often playing it safe and basic and remaining buried far too deep into the background. It also doesn’t buck trends and try to establish it’s own identity with those tracks. Instead, it feels like the safest, undetectable interpretation of what TRON: Legacy introduced to us.</p>
<p>That’s probably the best word I could use to describe TRON: Catalyst –<strong>&nbsp;</strong>safe. It has a lot of big ideas, but only gives you the faintest taste of each of them. As a fan of the franchise, I still adored every second of it, but I was never truly wowed or inspired playing this as I was from any other entries in the series. With an ending that so clearly queues up a sequel, my biggest wish is that whatever comes next is bigger, bolder, and louder in every way possible.</p>
