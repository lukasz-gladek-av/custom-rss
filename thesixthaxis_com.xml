		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced Surviving Mars Relaunched, an expanded version of 2018’s Surviving Mars. This relaunch version will include the base game, all of the original DLCs, including content packs and radio stations. Paradox has also confirmed that those with the original release will have an upgrade pathway, but the original version of Surviving Mars will be removed from sale on all platforms when Relaunched is launched.</p>

<p>Surviving Mars: Relaunched is not just going to be a repackage of Surviving Mars, with this release including user interface improvements as well as new content. That new content is called Martian Assembly, something not available in the original release, where a dynamic political system will be added. In the Martian Assembly, you will pass laws to balance the needs and wants of the colonists including domestic matters to full Martian independence.</p>
<p>If you own Surviving Mars and want to upgrade to Surviving Mars Relaunched, you will get a discount. Paradox has said, <em>” An automatic discount of $20 on the standard price $39.99 (discounted price $19.99) will be applied to your purchase of the base game Surviving Mars: Relaunched if the original Surviving Mars is already in your library. The discount will only be applied if you are purchasing it on the same platform and using the same account as your original purchase. The offer cannot be applied across platforms.”</em></p>

<p>In our Surviving Mars review, Stefan wrote, <em>“If we ever try to colonise our red neighbour, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges that mankind will ever undertake. Though Surviving Mars makes a game out of it, Haemimont have brilliantly kept that hard edge, as it constantly pushes and tests your ability to plan with survival in mind, especially with the unpredictability of the Mysteries of Mars. There’s plenty of ways to improve it and put more colony control in the hands of the player, but the first landing is already off to a great start.”</em></p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed Tropico 7 for 2026, with the game confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox Game Pass. This new entry into the long running series will introduce new elements including face to face talks with different faction leaders, and the ability to terraform the island to suit your own needs. If a river is not running in the direction you like, feel free to reroute it. You also be able to pick different dictatorship styles depending on political affiliations and the use of edicts.</p>

<p><em>“With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics — giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love,”</em> says Daniel Dumont, Studio and Creative Director at Gaming Minds Studios. <em>“This isn’t just a sequel, it’s the ultimate sandbox for would-be dictators. El Presidente would say: ‘The best Tropico ever — because it’s mine!’”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/01/tropico-6-review/">Tropico 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tropico 6 review, Nick said, <em>“Tropico 6 feels like the kind of game that you can fall back on when every other game gets a little too stressful. The economy can be tricky to get started, but you can soon start to kick back and take it easy. If you are finding it too hard though, turn on unlimited money and enjoy your break. It’s almost like going on holiday to the Caribbean, which is fitting really.”</em></p>
