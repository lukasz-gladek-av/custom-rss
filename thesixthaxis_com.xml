		<p>Atari has agreed to acquire an 82% stake in Swedish indie publisher and developer Thunderful Games, purchasing shares worth SEK 50 million (around €4.5 million). Thunderful is best known for&nbsp;SteamWorld, Islanders and Lost in Random.</p>
<p>Sadly, a restructuring of the company’s studios will take place following the acquisition.</p>


<p>The purchase is subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled for 28th August, but has already received support of Thunderful’s Board of Directors and the two largest shareholders right now – Owe Bergsten and Brjann Sigurgeirsson – who currently hold 29.9% of the company’s capital and voting rights. The purchase is being made possible by issuing new shares, so their stake and voting rights going forward will be significantly diminished.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari said, “This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari’s development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful’s teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe.”</p>

<p>Thunderful has a complicated business history, but boils down to having started as a merger between indie developers Image &amp; Form (best known for the SteamWorld series) and Zoink (Stick it to the Man!, Fe, Lost in Random), and Swedish retailer and distributor Bergsala in the 2019. In the following years, Thunderful has acquired more developers and publishers, including Headup Games (for a while), Coatsink and others, but the company has struggled in the last couple years. Through 2024, they made layoffs, divested Headup Games, and branched off the distribution businesses to make Thunderful Group a purely game development and game publishing entity, which is what Atari is now acquiring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Achilles: Legends Untold, released in 2023, introduced us to a new developer with great potential. Sure, several aspects of the game were certainly rough around the edges, but there was enough quality gaming to be had in this action RPG to suggest Dark Point Game had what it took to release an absolute banger. Their follow-up game, Achilles Survivor, is the realisation of that potential, offering one of the most-compelling and thrilling experiences available in the embryotic bullet heaven genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles: Survivor. Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15ahxwZMgYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Smartly reusing many of their gorgeous visual assets from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/03/achilles-legends-untold-review/">Achilles: Legends Untold</a>, Achilles Survivor bears an uncanny resemblance to its forbear. Played from a top-down perspective, Achilles or one of many other unlockable mythological characters, must survive for either ten or twenty minutes against an unending horde of monsters. This being a twist on Vampire Survivors, you do that with only one controller input: movement. You steer your character around the small, enclosed environment, dodging hordes of enemies, or smashing headlong through the smallest pack of them to break free.</p>
<p>Combat is automated, with each of your attacks auto-targeting foes on a repeating cycle. As you kill monsters, ranging from Ray Harryhausen style skeletons, to Cyclopes, and unpleasantly animated giant spiders, you quickly level-up. Doing so is crucial, as each incremental level provides you with a selection of additional attack powers or heightened abilities to choose from. Soon, you become the bullet hell, spewing out a multitude of deadly blades, a plume of poisoned griffin talons, and a parade of marching giants. It’s up to you to position and move your character just right to ensure you hit as many of your enemies as possible, whilst still being able to nimbly dodge their attacks.</p>


<p>One aspect that sets Achilles Survivor apart from many of its bullet heaven brethren is the rather neat building mechanic, which adds a lashing of strategy and consideration to your actions. As your survivor explorers the environment they’ll fine stone mines. Hang out around the perimeter of the mine and you’ll gradually accrue stone – this in and of itself adds to the tension, as gathering resources whilst a horde of enemies lumber towards you is quite the thrill – this can then be used to build defences at specific locations marked by a flag. You’ll get a random selection of four structures to choose from, some with offensive properties and others defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Defence types are varied, from flame thrower turrets and healing stations to poison emitting fountains and friendly warrior spawning Trojan Horses. Some defences only activate whilst you remain beside them, forcing you to bravely lure the enemies towards you before frantically fleeing at the last moment, while others work better in combination, such as a device that blasts enemies away so that they land in the spikey embrace of a nearby spear turret. Experimenting with different combinations to best thin the numbers of the enemy is all part of Achilles Survivor’s appeal.</p>
<p>There are various challenges to take on in each level that helps keeps things fresh. You can open up portals to add to the enemy count and ultimately be rewarded with some powerful loot, or close enemy spawn points by seeing off a set number of extra-powerful beasties. There are zones that if you remain within whilst killing enough baddies you’ll get a tasty bonus ability and treasure chests that can be peeked inside if you can just get past the veritable army blocking your way.</p>

<p>It all adds up to a ridiculously fun gameplay loop, satisfying and accessible, and one in which anyone could pick up a controller and have a riotous blast. Pacing is perfect, the volume of enemies gradually increasing until there are hundreds of the blighters on screen, as you desperately attempt to flank them before they close off your escape route, whilst the final remaining seconds on the clock tick down.</p>
<p>After each run, your character gains permanent upgrades, and also class specific bonuses which impact any other character you choose too. There’s always something cool to unlock, fostering that ‘just one more go’ mentality, be it new abilities, spells, buildings, characters, or levels. It’s intoxicatingly addictive, and before you know it hours of your life have gone by, as you sat with a glazed expression, slightly drooling from the ridiculous grin plastered on your face as you finally make it through a particularly challenging level.</p>


<p>My only complaint? Well, the bosses are a drag. They pop up infrequently but when they do, they often overstay their welcome. It’s not like they are particularly challenging – their area attacks can be easily dodged – it’s just that they are ridiculous bullet sponges who absorb a stupendous amount of damage. As such, the precise pacing and rhythm of the game is lost when the bosses turn up, turning proceedings into a slog until you finally whittle down their expansive health bar. One ten-minute level was doubled in length after a particularly gruelling battle with Paris – not the city, but the irritating prat from Troy. With any luck, a patch or two will refine the boss experience. Either way, bosses or not, Achilles Survivor staunchly remains one of the best examples of its genre currently available.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft have released update 1.07 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it brings a popular feature, New Game+ mode. In short, if you have finished the main story you can restart the game but keep all the trinkets and gubbins you acquired during your first run, so you are super powerful to start with.</p>
<p>Here are the Assassin’s Creed Shadow Update 1.07 patch notes:</p>


<h3 id="TkVXIEdBTUUr">NEW GAME+</h3>
<p>Upon completing the main story on any difficulty, start a new game while keeping all collected skills, gear, Allies and hideout progression from your first playthrough. You can start a New Game+ playthrough from the Memory Menu in the Animus after finishing all journeys of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro.</p>
<p>Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough you’ll be awarded Whisper of Gold, and Dragon’s Gold! Brand new gold plated Legendary Long Katana and Legendary Katana with their own unique perk engravings.</p>
<p>Take your journey through Feudal Japan to the next level as many times as you want… or at least up to 8 times with New Game+! With each new venture into New Game+, face stronger foes, more demanding challenges, and tests of your Shinobi and Samurai skills.</p>

<h3 id="S05PV0xFREdFIFJBTksg">KNOWLEDGE RANK &amp; LEVEL CAP INCREASE</h3>
<p>Prepare to push beyond your limits! We’ve raised the level cap from 60 to 80, meaning tougher foes with enhanced tactics and awareness – demanding sharper reflexes and smarter strategies.</p>
<p>To meet this rising threat, we’ve also expanded the Knowledge Rank system to 9 &amp; 10 allowing players to unlock and develop a broader array of skills, passives, and combat techniques to become even more masterful.</p>
<p>New Game+ awaits! But before taking on the task of a new journey, you can upgrade the passives and skills of Naoe and Yasuke! Players will gain 1 new rank for multiple nodes in their Mastery Skills, and 10 new ranks for all existing Knowledge passives to become even more formidable.</p>
<p>A test of your skills is no match without the right gear! The Forge can now be upgraded to level 4, allowing players to upgrade all weapons and gear to level 80 to have the edge on the rising threats that await.</p>
<p>With new levels and ranks, come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enjoy the Ride</strong>: Reach Level 80</li>
<li><strong>Stars Unseen</strong>: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>
<li><strong>Worth its Wait</strong>: Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana (by completing the story on New Game+).</li>

		<p>Nintendo has finally added Mario Paint to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the SNES painting game considered a true classic by connoisseurs, and in a pleasant surprise, it arrives with full Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and USB mouse support in general!</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Paint - Super NES – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different modes in Mario Paint that engage different styles of early digital artistry. For beginners, the colouring book mode lets you select from a palette of colours and fill in the line art of whatever scene is before you, but there’s further fun quirks like filling with pixel art sheets. Drawing Board is then more like a full on MS Paint with different brush types to bring your digital paining into reality – it’s where the iconic Undo Dog comes from to… undo stuff.</p>
<p>Stamp Designer lets you create 16×16 pixel art, saving a small handful of these tiles that you can then combine and animate across scenes with up to nine frames that repeat and follow a path you draw.&nbsp;Then there’s Music Composition creating songs from 15 distinctive sounds, including dog, cat, pig, goose and baby!</p>
<p>All of these can be combined to create and play scenes of your own devising. The original cartridge and game seriously limits how much you can save, but with four save slots available to suspend the game in Switch Online, you can quadruple the possibilities.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Gnat Attack, a mode where you break out a fly swatter and slap flies that are buzzing around.</p>
<p>All of this was played best with a mouse on SNES, and will be here as well. On Switch 2, you can just detach a Joy-Con 2, hold it on its side to a surface and use mouse mode, but there is also support for USB mice on both Switch 2 and the original Switch, plugging them into the dock.</p>
<p>In a nice little extra, all the music from Mario Paint is also now available in the Nintendo Music app, which Switch Online subscribers all have access to.</p>
