		<p>The Game of Thrones furore seems like a long time ago. The original book, A Song of Ice and Fire was released in 1996, while the TV show finished in 2019. Still, “You know nothing, Jon Snow” remains part of our daily banter, and the series legacy on the page and the screen is as strong as ever, thanks to the ongoing House of the Dragon show filling in many of the world’s blanks. Netease are hoping to continue the franchise’s popularity with the arrival of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and today is the last day you can <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">sign up for the upcoming closed beta test</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is set for release later this year on iOS, Android and PC, and this closed beta will be the first time for players to go hands-on with the title. It was announced very recently at The Game Awards show, with the accompanying trailer certainly looking the part, capturing the bleak and wintry world of northern Westeros.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will see you take on the role of an unknown new character, who, through a quirk of fate, becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house in the north of Westeros. There’ll be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin. There’s going to be a focus on player vs player combat, and it looks as though it has a touch of For Honor about it, though whether it turns out to be as in-depth or challenging as Ubisoft’s game remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta will run January 16 to January 22nd for Android and PC, while the game will eventually launch on iOS as well. Netease are known for creating visually impressive titles, and their take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/ni-no-kuni-cross-worlds-review-ios-android-pc/">Ni No Kuni</a> was absolutely beautiful, even if the gameplay couldn’t match up to the original PS3 release. Game of Thrones has never managed to turn in a truly great video game adapatation, though the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/19/telltales-game-of-thrones-episode-six-the-ice-dragon-review/">Telltale series</a> did a decent enough job of bringing the world to life.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing how Game of Thrones: Kingsroad turns out, this is the perfect chance, though you only have <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">today to get your sign-up in</a>! If you do take part then you’ll receive exclusive rewards for your character once the game officially launches later this year.</p>

		<p>Marvel Rivals is good, isn’t it? More chaotic and unbalanced than its inspiration, Overwatch, but that means it’s also wilder, less prescribed, and arguably a lot of fun. It helps that Marvel Rivals is packed full of recognisable comic-book characters, and the development team at NAME are already adding more to that roster with the arrival of Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night, with new characters Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman representing the Fantastic Four in a fan-friendly way. Seriously, between this and Pedro Pascale, expect to see a lot of Mr Fantastic fan art in the next few months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1 Battle Pass: Darkhold | Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FWR6mwGDTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most important arrival with Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night is the new Battle Pass, entitled Darkhold. This book of the damned is thoroughly evil, so each of the new character skins gives them a darker vibe than you might be used to. Wolverine definitely has something of a Van Helsing vibe, while Moon Knight’s outfit is more like an eclipse than normal. As a Rocket Racoon main I’m looking forward to nabbing his Steampunk outfit for sure.</p>
<p>If you’re not trying to pimp out your current character, perhaps you’re planning on playing as one of the new ones. Duelist-class Mister Fantastic brings some Dhalsim-like stretchy melee to the mix, his limbs shooting out to smack enemies around, while he can also pump himself up to take more damage. His special sees him repeatedly bouncing up and down on a controllable area, which looks as though it’s going to cause absolute chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mister Fantastic: Stretching Into Action | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQjjy1po-ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also Mister Fantastic’s partner to think about. Sue Storm appears – or is that disappears? – as Invisible Woman, a Strategist class character bringing concussive blasts and shields to bear against her opponents. She can fire individual blasts, or use a powerful push to force enemies out of the way or bounce them off the side of a map which looks deeply annoying already.  Her special can hide an area from sight, stopping external characters from being able to see in, while trapping those inside.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Invisible Woman: Unseen Force | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhgYIMEG1Zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on who you’re playing as, there’s two new maps for you to explore. The first of these is the Sanctum Sanctorum, with Dr Strange’s mystic home appearing so that you can make a horrible mess of it. Stalking the halls, players can expect to see a variety of odd and unusual sights, while checking out a range of fan-teasing artwork, set off by a portrait of Dr Strange and his dog, Bats.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Empire Of Eternal Night: The Mystical Sanctum Sanctorum | Map Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVlerpIo3Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second new map is Midtown. Empire of the Eternal Night has seen Dracula and his cohort attacking New York, and here recognisable Marvel landmarks like the Baxter Building have clearly been having a hard time of it. There’s plenty of destruction for you to work your way around, all topped off by a cheeky inverted A on the Avengers building where the horizontal line blinks in and out so it looks like a ‘V’. For vampire, right?</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 – Empire of the Eternal Night launches on January 10th on all platforms, and also coincides with the game’s launch on GeForce Now, so you can indulge in the darker side of Marvel wherever you are!</p>
