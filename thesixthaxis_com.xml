		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> Obelisk update is here, and it’s the biggest update for the game to date, bringing a new map for the Operations PvE mode, a new Chaos enemy, and a Dark Angels cosmetics pack for those with the Season Pass. The update is out now across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> (with new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support), <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>

<p>Return to the burial world of Demerium in the new Operation, Obelisk. Here you’ll battle against the new Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, who have fast paced attacks and zip around the world on a flying Disc of Tzeentch. However, they won’t be limited to just this map. As a new Majoris enemy, they can be found in every Operation that features the Thousand Sons from now on.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Season Pass has some new goodies with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, which includes a new Champion skin for the Bulwak class, and new skins for the Plasma Pistol, Auto Bolt Rifle and Power Sword. You’ve also got a new Storm Shield skin and over 40 unique cosmetics celebrating eight of the Dark Angels Successor Chapters.</p>
<p>The Obelisk update brings some enhancement for PS5 Pro and PC gamers, with the patch adding new maximum resolutions for both the 60FPS Performance Mode and 30FPS Quality mode, using PS5 Pro’s PSSR upscaling technique to hit 4K in both situations. PC players will now also have FSR 3 upscaling support, and DLSS 3 with frame generation support.</p>

<p>Saber is committed to bringing more content to the game through 2025. This will include both free updates that add the Neo-Volkite pistol, more new PvE opeartions, PvP maps and modes, and a new Horde Mode in a later update. The Season Passes will then have more premium cosmetics to unlock for your Space Marines, so you can represent your favourite chapters.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>
