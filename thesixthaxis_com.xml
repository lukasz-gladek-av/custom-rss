		<p>Popular gaming accessory maker <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/8bitdo">8BitDo</a> is halting shipments to the US from its Chinese warehouses and manufacturing because of the impact that Trump’s tariffs are having. Existing stock within US warehouses will continue to be sold, but there’s no restocks coming until the situation has been resolved or worked around.</p>
<p>They’re joining other companies like gaming handheld maker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/562454/retro-handheld-industry-retroid-anbernic">Anbernic</a>, PC case maker <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/pc-case-maker-hyte-halts-shipments-to-us-due-to-trumps-tariffs">Hyte</a> and others in halting shipments to the US through the uncertain times for Chinese imports ahead.</p>


<p>Originally known for their retro controller recreations and replacement boards for classic gamepads, 8BitDo’s brand has grown in the last few years as they’ve shipped more general purpose controllers for all modern platforms, whether it’s a full-sized Ultimate 2 controller, a retro-style mechanical keyboard and mouse, or the tiny Micro controller for quick pick-up gaming. They’re among the many accessory makers who have adopted Hall Effect sensors for their analogue sticks, while maintaining comparable or lower prices to first party controllers for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p>
<p>The pause in shipping to the US is down to two policies that the Trump administration has put in place, with the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and an end to <em>de minimis&nbsp;</em>exemptions for shipments valued under $800 coming about as close to a trade ban as you can get without actually putting one in place. While there’s a stay of execution for smartphones and other consumer electronics, video game consoles and accessories are classified as toys by the US ITC.</p>
<p>The full impact of Trump’s tariffs is yet to really be felt, as many companies with Chinese supply chains rushed to get imports through before tariffs would be applied and some of the biggest tech giants have diversified their manufacturing hubs to use other countries throughout Asia – Apple, for example, has built up manufacturing in India, Nintendo is using Vietnam for some Switch 2 production, and so on – and so are able to get the lower 10% tariff rate that is applied to the rest of the world… for now.</p>

<p>There is the looming threat of the higher tariffs for almost all countries that were announced back at the start of April coming back, but given just how much manufacturing is still centralised in China, the US will start to feel the impact of this very soon.</p>

		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>
