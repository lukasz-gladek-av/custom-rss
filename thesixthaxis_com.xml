		<p>All-consuming audiovisual VR odyssey <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thrasher">Thrasher</a> is getting a flatscreen release later this year, alongside the PC VR port of the game. There’s no release date just yet, but this port will let you play this successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thumper">Thumper</a> across PC headsets, gaming PCs and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> as well.</p>

<p>Originally releasing last year for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro, the game skipped out on PC or consoles to start with. We can only hope that there are plans for a PS5 and PSVR 2 release in this game’s future as well.</p>
<p>Coming from Brian Gibon, the artist and composer of Thumper, and Mike Mandel or Rock Band VR at their new studio Puddle, Thrasher looks to explore the rhythm action genre in a similarly dark and moody style. In this game you guide a space eel that is swooping through alien worlds in a race for survival, with players digging into a combo system that ties in with a chase to the top of leaderboards.</p>
<p>This was designed with VR in mind, fully immersing you into the game’s world, but it’s now being reworked to keep as much of that atmosphere when playing on a traditional flat screen platform. The visuals are being enhanced to take advantage of the power of modern gaming PCs when compared to standalone VR headsets. You’ll probably want to have a great pair of headphones plugged in, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/18/thumper-psvr2-review/">Returning to the 2016 classic Thumper in 2023</a>, Dom said, “Thumper remains a true VR classic, and its upgrade for PSVR2 makes it the best place to experience its violent audio charms.”</p>
