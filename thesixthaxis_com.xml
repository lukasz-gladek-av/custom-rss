		<p>Rahul Kohli introduced a new story trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>, Housemarque’s roguelite shooter successor coming out on 30th April 2026 for PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s an intriguing element here with, as Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli), is not alone here. He’s led a team of Soltari Enforcers to this planet, but for some reason they’re now trapped here in a time loop with a dying sun. This is a…. stressful situation and they’re not handling it all too well in the trailer.</p>
<p>From what we’ve seen in previous trailer and reveals, the gameplay structure will be pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

		<p>James Bond will be facing a piratical villain in 007: First Light as rock legend Lenny Kravitz steps in the world of video games in his first role. He will play as Bawma, “the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who’s as charismatic as he is unpredictable.”</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light – Lenny Kravitz Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hT1kFDUmu_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>

<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

		<p>Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog have announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis a reimagining and remake of Lara’s original adventure. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">an original game expected in 2027</a>, Legacy of Atlantis will arrive in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Tomb Raider has been revisited a good few times over the years. Originally released in 1996, Tomb Raider: Anniversary was released in 2007, a PS3 era remake that came early on in Crystal Dynamics’ tenure as the franchise developer.</p>
<p>Now we’re entering into a new era for Tomb Raider, with Amazon acting as publisher after Crystal Dynamics was sold off by Square Enix a few years ago. A remake tends to be an easy go-to for publishers to greenlight and developers to refind a series’ core and often make a jump to a new game engine – usually Unreal Engine, let’s be honest. It will be interesting to see how faithful and how reimagined this game ends up being.</p>
<p>Want some blurb to pad the word count? Yeah, let’s have that.</p>

<p><em>As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time—from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether you’re a veteran raider or new to Lara’s world, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis delivers jaw-dropping visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises, while honoring the spirit and atmosphere of Lara Croft’s debut adventure.</em></p>
