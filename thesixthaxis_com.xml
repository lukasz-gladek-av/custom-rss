		<p>The most premium of games which is only for premium players, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a>, is absolutely great and there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s your PC that’s rubbish and you don’t know how to configure it. That’s what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/randy-pitchford-reminds-you-that-borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers/">Randy Pritchford say</a>s so we can all ignore the statement released by Gearbox that states:</p>
<p>“We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming. This is our top priority.”</p>



<p data-start="0" data-end="456">Look, folks, let me tell you something very important about Borderlands 4—it runs beautifully.&nbsp; Everybody’s saying it’s one of the smoothest, most incredible games ever made. No performance issues, none. The people trying to say otherwise? Fake news. They’re the same people who always want to tear down great American entertainment, the same tired critics like Jimmy Kimmel, a bad man, who has been wrong about everything from the beginning. Believe me.</p>
<p data-start="458" data-end="780">Borderlands 4 is fast, it’s sharp, it looks amazing—better than anyone thought possible. The developers did a tremendous job, maybe the best job ever. Everybody’s talking about how great it feels, how stable it is, how much fun they’re having. And you know what? They’re right. Because it works perfectly. Zero problems.</p>

<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The fake news media doesn’t want you to enjoy it, they want to make up stories about “frame drops” or “performance problems.” Total lies. Don’t believe them. Ask the gamers, ask the fans—they’ll tell you the truth. Borderlands 4 is a massive success, running flawlessly, and people are loving it more than ever before. It’s a big, beautiful win. And we’re not going to let fake news take that away.</p>
<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">You know me, I like a border, big beautiful borders with big fences and to keep the robotic pyschos out of my game. We need more Borderlands like this because it’s the biggliest and best Borderlands ever.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new video for Football Manager 26 has been released by Sports Interactive, and the core subject is the introduction of women’s football to the series. The video shows how Sports Interactive has incorporated women’s football into Football Manager, confirming there will be 14 leagues across 11 countries with WSL and WSL2 among those leagues. Women’s football has been fully integrated into the game, allowing players to have both men and women’s league active in their games, or you can choose to play either men’s football or women’s football only.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | Introducing Women's Football" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJ39Hd-O-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The women’s football database will include over 40,000 players as well, making it the biggest women’s football database in any game. Women’s player stats are equivalent to the men’s stats, but also within the context of the women’s game. Sports Interactive has gone further with animations with women footballers being used to motion capture movements, so the on the pitch action resembles close to the reality of how women play football. Sports Interactive has also confirmed that this is just the first step for women’s football in the Football Manager series, with the database set to expand and the experience to get more depth in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/10/football-manager-26-releases-on-november-4th/">Sports Interactive recently confirmed that Football Manager 26 releases on November 4th</a> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, Game Pass, and mobile exclusively through Netflix. Football Manager 26 Touch will launch on December 4th for Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Codemasters might have the official F1 license, but that hasn’t stopped indie developers from creating their own take on the premier racing class. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/new-star-gp-review/">New Star GP</a> drew on classic Sega arcade racing thrills last year, but speeding toward a fierce braking zone is Formula Legends, the fresh-faced rookie, which has taken the hard-nosed, serious sport and given it a cute, hyper-deformed makeover, all the while attempting to retain the competitive racing action of its inspiration. It’s a pretty successful attempt too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Formula Legends - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgUCx--1qfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Formula Legends is not officially licensed by the FIA, so there’s no official drivers, no official constructors, and no official tracks. What there is, however, is a roster of drivers inspired by their real-life counterparts, so you can welcome Danny Ricchiordi and Luis Hammerton to the sport, rather than Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton. You can laugh your little socks off at Batteri Voltas and Charlie Lacreme, or just enjoy my personal favourite, Hans Troll, simply because of how much it might annoy Lance… or more probably his dad.</p>


<p>Formula Legends takes you through the history of F1, through a lightly distorted lens. Starting in the 1960s, the central Story Mode offers a range of races in each era, providing a taste of the different cars, steadily improving technology, and the changes to the layout of each track over the years.</p>
<p>While they’re not allowed to use the official names for each location, the different tracks and their alternate layouts across the decades are close enough to their real-world inspirations to let you pick out the sweeping curves of Spa-Francorchamps and the iconic setting at Monza. They’re definitely ‘inspired by’ though, so if you think you know the Melbourne Park circuit like the back of the hand, you might need to prepare to stare questioningly at the skin there. In some cases the tracks are mirrored too, presumably to avoid too many angry looks from license holders, so you come away with a flavour of the sport, rather than a full course.</p>


<p>The little F1 race cars we get in Formula Legends are undoubtedly cute to look at, but they’re almost as difficult to drive as the real thing. Dropping things down to Easy, alongside a couple of driving assists for braking and traction control, will likely see you whizz by the competition, and Formula Legends becomes wholly approachable here. Meanwhile, playing on Normal really ramps the difficulty up, and it’s a welcome and rewarding challenge where track knowledge and braking points need to be spot on. The Hard setting following that isn’t as much of a leap, but you will need to drive more or less flawlessly to be in with a chance of a podium.</p>
<p>The AI drivers won’t make that very easy. To say that they’re aggressive would be to downplay just how little they care about whose corner it is, and you’ll be glad to discover that damage is a health bar, rather than individual pace-wrecking components. They’re not really all that smart, and you’ll see them careening off at various points, but when Logan Sargeant was still in the sport up until a year ago, that remains fairly realistic.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Formula Legends handling model. It’s undoubtedly an arcade racer, and they feel more like the toy cars they look like than open-wheel race cars, but once you’ve got into the flow of things, sweeping around corners with surety becomes second nature. You can’t treat it like a simulation, and if you do, you’ll actually come off far worse than you might expect.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nods to realism though, including having to select the right tyres, coping with their degradation, and conducting pitstops. These involve a fun little mini-game where you have to match the right button press, all the while repairing and refuelling your car, before mashing the analogue stick buttons in, and it definitely adds to the experience, especially in a tight race. Alongside that, the attention to detail given to each era is a real treat, from the sepia tones and the pitstop tents of the early years through to the inclusion of BRS – definitely not DRS – in the modern age.</p>

<p>Formula Legends is a small-scale taste of F1, and that becomes more apparent the longer you spend with it. There are no multiplayer modes here, whether local or online, and that’s a real shame for an approachable arcade racer. Equally, there are only 14 tracks, and while that number is buoyed by the different renditions of them across each era, they are fundamentally the same track. When the sport has expanded as far as it has, with sprint races and 24 race seasons, that means there’s some obvious gaps.</p>
<p>Those gaps continue onto the grid, so races host 14 cars, rather than the 20 we’re used to, and the maximum championship length you can create is 14 too – fine if you want to recreate a season from the 1980s, but limited for the modern sport. I’d really like the option of multi-season championships, and racers moving about, but that’s clearly not what Formula Legends is designed for. This is an indie game created with a genuine love for the sport, and it offers a wholly different take from its peers.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is generally very good, with crisp, clear visuals that make the most of the cute art design. There’s the tiniest hint of pop in, but it fades into the distance so much that you won’t notice while you’re concentrating on the more immediate racing line. We did also get to check out the Nintendo Switch version, and that’s a wholly different story, with glaring pop-in, massively reduced resolution, and the lack of analogue triggers causing all sorts of issues. Make sure to pick up the PC, PS5 or Xbox versions, and cross your fingers for a Switch 2 update…</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/tencent-hit-back-at-sonys-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-hit-back-at-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram.1302315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tencent have rebuffed Sony’s claims that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a> is a “slavish clone” of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon franchise</a> and that it copies multiple elements from they games that would confuse consumers.&nbsp; Sony asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram, Tencent are asking for the whole thing to be thrown out of court.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants—about the unreleased video game&nbsp;Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony’s game&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn and its spinoffs,” the complaint reads, according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">TheGamePost.</a></p>
<p>“At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony’s exclusive domain.”</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the rest of the legal waffle but the short version is that Tencent claim that elements such as a red-haired heroine, robotic creatures, and ruined cities are tropes that can be found in many video games, and they give examples such as Far Cry, BioMutant, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>. Sony themselves published a Ninja Theory game with a red haired heroine, Heavenly Sword, but that doesn’t get a mention.</p>

<p>“In Sony’s telling, Horizon Zero Dawn is ‘like no fictional world created before [or] since.’ That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolize through this lawsuit,” say Tencent.</p>
<p>That line about Sony’s own developers may be a problem for the PlayStation giant. Sony released a documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn, and in it, Jan-Bart Van Beek, the art director for the game, references Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and suggests the new Horizon title is similar: “I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points.”</p>
<p>“Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game,” say Tencent.&nbsp;Enslaved is an action game with mechanical beasties set in a ruined landscape but the hero is male, the red-haired character, Trip, is not playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved: Odyssey to the West - PS3  Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzwQX_orYf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at Enslaved at first glance it does resemble Horizon but I don’t think Tencent have much of a chance, Sony’s complaint isn’t really about claiming all the individual elements are their own, they are claiming the combination of all these things, along with the art style and music, make Light of Motiram a copy of Horizon.&nbsp; Their claim is comparable to a claim over music copyright; there are only so many notes and everyone uses them, but if you put them in the same order as someone else, then you are making a copy.</p>
<p>Tencent have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page</a> and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine.</p>
<p>Now, can we please, please have that remaster of Enslaved now?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/two-of-the-best-co-op-games-of-all-time-launch-today-on-nintendo-switch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do like to play co-op games. Luckily for me, there’s enough of us kicking around in TSA towers that we’re able to generally find someone of a similar mind to play a game with. If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably pretty used to the odd spot of co-op too, and that’s about to get better as today marks the launch of two of the greatest co-op puzzle adventures of all time, appearing for the first time for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Those games are the iconic We Were Here and We Were Here Too, the first two games in the We Were Here series. </p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here &amp; We Were Here Too Launch Trailer I Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUn4X9HajDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frankly, if you’ve got a co-op buddy to call on, I’d tell you to just go and pick them up now, but if not, then here’s a little context in order to get you interested. The We Were Here series has captivated players with its co-op puzzle designs and challenging duos to think outside the box since 2017, when We Were Here launched as a free game that has now been downloaded almost 10 million times. </p>
<p>Since then, the We Were Here series has been enjoyed by more than 20 million players. We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip is the latest release and it broke all previous records out of the water by hitting more than 8 million downloads within its first year. The puzzling adventures are playable in any order, although a common narrative thread runs through them.</p>
<p>Communication and lateral thinking are your two biggest weapons in the We Were Here series, and things are made all the more interesting by physically having to activate the in-game walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammate. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans on the way to solving each puzzle, and there’s just such a strong sense of identity and visual design that you can’t help but be drawn ever further into its idisyncratic world. </p>

<p>Players can pre-purchase the third entry of the series, We Were Here Together, on September 25 in the Nintendo eShop. A demo will then also be playable from September 25 to 28 at the Total Mayhem Games booth at Tokyo Game Show. The release of We Were Here Together will follow on October 9.</p>
<p>The We Were Here series, including We Were Here, We Were Here Too, and We Were Here Together, has also undergone significant enhancements. These include a visual overhaul, updated user interface, expanded settings, additional language translations, bug fixes, and cross-platform compatibility with PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. These updates are also making their way to other platforms, with full implementation expected by 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>﻿The We Were Here games will be fully compatible with Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2. A Nintendo Switch Online Membership and a headset with a microphone (or a different way to communicate with your partner) will be required to play the We Were Here Series on Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>
