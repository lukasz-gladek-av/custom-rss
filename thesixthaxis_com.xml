		<p>The next big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> update has been previewed ahead of its February release, with Patch 6.0 set to introduce a new PvP map, Datavault, Tyranid Biovore and more.</p>
<p>There’s also the dangled thread that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. As we head into Season 3 of content for Winter 2025, there’s just Season 4 and Spring 2025 left to come, but the team writes, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>


<p>But back to the (almost) here and now, the 6.0 update has got a fresh batch of new content for players to take on:</p>
<ul>
<li>New PvP Map – Tomb</li>
<li>New PvE Enemy – Tyranid Biovore</li>
<li>New Battle Barge Feature – Datavault</li>
<li>Aboslute Difficulty</li>
<li>Perks Rework</li>
<li>FoV Slider for PC</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Salamander Champion</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Raven Guard Pack</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig in a little deeper.</p>


<p>The new PvP map, Tomb, takes place under the surface of Demerium, digging into the creepy environs of a Necron tomb. It’s a map that is closed off with narrow passages, so there’s plenty of blind spots to be aware of, though there is also a more open arena for a change of combat range.</p>
<p>In PvE, the Tyranid Biovore can now appear in all Operations featuring the Tyranids. This is an Extremis enemy that shoots out Spore Mines that you need to dodge and destroy before they impact, but it can also be deadly at close range.</p>

<p>The Datavault on the Battle Barge is a new area to give unlockable information on different parts of the game and cosmetic rewards. You’ll nead to earn special currency from completing the in-game Ordeals achievements across all modes. These could be thinks like making a Carnifex stun itself, knocking back Spore Mines to kill Tyranids, or completing missions in Operations at specific threat levels.</p>
<p>Through the rest of the update, there will be a perks rework, though Saber didn’t go into details here, an FOV slider on PC – useful for ultra-wide monitors – an Absolute difficulty level, and the following smaller improvements and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New finisher animations on Zoanthropes, Scarab Occult Terminators and Rubric Marines.</li>
<li>A new functionality will be added, allowing you to upgrade your Master-Crafted and Artificer Armoury Data to Relic by trading them. You can also sell your Armoury Data to get Requisition Points.</li>
<li>Absolute Difficulty (unlocked after completing 1 Operation in Lethal Difficulty) will unlock a bloodstained Knife Combat and a new pauldron.</li>
<li>Base Decals available for Right Pauldrons</li>
<li>A new option to share your skin between PvE and PvP modes will be added. This option also allows you to share your patterns between classes.</li>
<li>PvP Crossplay Toggle On/Off: allows console players to play with PC players. You now have the option to be matched with either PC players or Console players independently.</li>
<li>New Emotes – Strengthen the bond with your fellow Brothers with the new emotes! So go ahead and use them without moderation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding things out for Season Pass holders, the Salamanders Champion will be available for the Sniper class, and the Ravens Guard cosmetic pack will bring the classic MK VI ‘Corvus’ helmet design, a fan-favourite beaky look that dates back to the earliest versions of Warhammer 40,000.</p>

		<p>Microsoft’s Q2 earnings call has provided a number of highlights for the Xbox gaming division, including strong game and Xbox Game Pass performance, but the most important statistic is that the company saw a 7% revenue decline, year-on-year, in large part because of a huge 29% drop in Xbox hardware revenue through the final few months of 2024.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has brought in over 4 million players across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this is an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5 in the first half of this year.</p>


<p>Microsoft CEO <a title="People > Satya Nadella [120 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/satya-nadella/">Satya Nadella</a> also touted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> as having a record breaking launch quarter, as it topped sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation, showing the value in multi-platform releases for Microsoft going forward.</p>
<p>Both of these launches fuelled a 30% growth in Game Pass subscribers on PC, which also indicates the potential of this subscription service, after a few years of slower growth than Microsoft had wanted. This helped Game Pass set a new quarterly revenue record, with the overall Xbox content and services revenue growing 2%.</p>
<p>However, in the quarter ending on 31st December 2024, the gaming division made $6.6 billion in revenue, which was a drop of $530 million year-over-year. That’s quite significant and revealing, as 2023’s figures had the massive bump of acquiring <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard in October 2023</a>, flooding the financial report with all the sales of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Diablo revenue. That helped to mask whatever else was going on with Microsoft’s gaming business through 2024’s quarterly reports, but we’re now seeing a meaningful comparison once again.</p>

<p>It’s really looking like Xbox’s decline as a console manufacturer is now irreversible, and little in Microsoft’s new multiplatform release plan is going to arrest that slide. The company has a huge deficit to PlayStation this generation, without the impetus of exclusive games, there’s little reason for gamers to really consider jumping to Xbox in future. Things could slide even further as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 releases later this year</a>…</p>
