		<p>THQ Nordic has announced a Sacred 2 Remaster, a modernised version of the 2008 action RPG, coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sacred 2 Remaster | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YzPPceRfyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remaster is in development by Jumpgate and SparklingBit, revitalising the game with high resolution textures and improved lighting effects, improved combat, a modernised UI, and bugfixes for the game. This will also include all of the expansions and updates previously released for the game, and I think you can see from the trailer that this will still look and feels like a game from 2008.</p>
<p>A prequel to the original Sacred, this game takes players to the world of Ancaria as itâ€™s on the precipice of disaster. T-Energy, the power source that helped to bring prosperity to the world, has been twisted and corrupted to bring conflict and chaos. Six heroes step forward, each with their own path and story to explore in this world.</p>
