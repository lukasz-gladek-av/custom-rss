		<p>Xbox has announced a new “multi-year strategic partnership” with AMD, securing the chipmaker to develop the processors for the next-generation of Xbox devices, which will include consoles, PC, handheld and cloud gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>President of Xbox Sarah Bond announces the partnership and confirms that AMD will co-engineer silicon with Microsoft for a wide portfolio of devices, which does include the next-generation Xbox console.</p>
<p>This confirms that Microsoft is sticking around in the console-making business and will release a successor to the Xbox Series X|S to go up against the inevitable PlayStation 6.</p>
<p>Bond promises that this will enable “deeper visual quality, immersive gameplay, and AI-powered experiences”, as well as noting that the platforms and the ecosystems will “not tied to a single store or device, and fully compatible with your existing Xbox game library.”</p>

<p>This is largely a confirmation of the direction that Microsoft is heading in, following on from the announcements at Summer Game Fest. There Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/xbox-just-announced-their-first-ever-handhelds-the-rog-xbox-ally-and-ally-x/">ROG Ally X</a>, a new Windows PC handheld developed by Asus and with Xbox branding and integration. They also doubled down on Xbox Play Anywhere, a scheme in which you can purchase a game from Microsoft and play it across both Xbox consoles and Windows PC… except that they now brand this as Xbox PC to unify the approach.</p>
<p>Sticking with AMD makes an awful lot of sense. AMD’s CPUs are market leading on PC at the moment and their GPUs have made great strides with the most recent generation to catch up with Nvidia in areas like neural upscaling and ray tracing. Their work is continuing with <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/337062/amd-announces-fsr-4-updates-project-redstone">Project Redstone for the Radeon 9000 series</a>, though Microsoft is obviously privvy to behind-the-scenes work being done for future generations as well.</p>
<p>Similar to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft and AMD will co-develop future chipsets for Xbox consoles and devices – just as AMD and Sony co-develop the chips for PlayStation consoles in the last two generations. What this generally looks like is AMD providing the technology and Microsoft fine-tuning the configuration, potentially pushing to include certain key features that could be coming from future CPU and GPU technology, rolling it back into the fixed platform of a console.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft’s sticking around with a more traditional console, it sounds like, and it will be backward compatible. Good news!</p>

		<p>Bungie has announced the delay of Marathon, their upcoming extraction shooter. The game will no longer release on 23rd September, and no new date has been given by Bungie for the game’s release.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team writes in a Marathon Development Update. “We’ve taken&nbsp;this&nbsp;to heart, and we know we need more time to craft&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;into the game that truly reflects your passion.&nbsp;After much discussion within our Dev team,&nbsp;we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release.</p>


<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat.</p>
<p>“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players. ”</p>
<p>The blog post also highlights areas that the studio is looking to improve before the game can be fully released, and which will be put under the microscope in upcoming testing. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding more social experiences
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bungie likely won’t give further updates on the game’s development for the next few months, as they say, “You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date.&nbsp;Thank you again for your patience and— much more importantly— your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make&nbsp;Marathon the&nbsp;incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team and PlayStation alike, as console maker looks to avoid having another ignominious flop of a live service title – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, of course, was a huge financial write down when the game was released, quickly pulled from shelves, and shut down last year. Bungie has endured <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> over the last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. With the initial reaction to Marathon since the gameplay reveal being rather mixed, Sony has put on a brave face for the game’s future, but it makes sense that the game is delayed to try and stick the landing.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that a delay could see Marathon miss the boat even further and fail to capitalise on the interest that there is in a new extraction shooter.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more later this year.</p>
