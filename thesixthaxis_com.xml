		<p>Watching the credits roll on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> after twenty something hours, I had a sudden realisation. Apart from one completely avoidable KO (I forgot to pause the game while answering the door), I had managed to blitz my way through the game without failing a single quest.&nbsp;It got me thinking, is Monster Hunter Wilds too easy?</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For context, I barreled my way through all the main quests, engaging in as little side content as possible, and only started upgraded my weapons and armour during the game’s final act. Even then, I wasn’t paying any particular attention to my loadout, slapping together a patchwork of different armour sets and only caring about the overall defence rating.</p>
<p>The reason for this wasn’t for lack of caring – Wilds offers a huge amount of customisation and scope for build optimisation – but as with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, there was little incentive to fuss over armour until reaching the endgame, mainly focusing on weapon crafting and making sure I had a small arsenal that could exploit any elemental weaknesses.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t accuse Monster Hunter Wilds of aggressive hand-holding, though there are plenty of revised features and mechanics that make it by far the most streamlined and accessible games in the series to date. With its shift towards a seamless open world (instead of travelling between self-contained biomes) there’s been a shift away from making meticulously pre-hunt preparations. Whether stocking up on items, swapping weapons, or even cooking a succulent meal, this can all be done in the press of a few buttons, no matter where you are.</p>


<p>The Seikret – your new bird-like mount – also helps to greatly simplify the core gameplay loop. It will automatically give chase to a target monster, paring back the investigation system introduced in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>. By popping open the world map, you can set a waypoint anywhere then sit back and watch the Seikret do all the navigation for you. From the saddle, you can even use your grapple tool to scoop up resources instead of needing to be in close proximity – a couch potato’s dream! Initially, from a purist perspective, it feels kind of wrong though it’s definitely useful and, most importantly, saves time.</p>
<p>It’s no doubt Capcom’s intention to get hunters stuck into the combat gameplay as quickly as possible, and for as long as possible. It’s the reason for the season with each weapon being even more deadly thanks to the advanced movesets and abilities found in Wilds. Still, on the whole, monster battles offered little resistance during my playthrough – it was only the final two encounters that forced me to lock in and focus and, as a result, they were the most fun and engaging. There is an abundance of environmental interactions that can aid you in a fight, from impromptu traps and falling debris, to helpful critters that can heal or hinder.</p>

<p>Your feline Palico companion is also a bit of a handrail, occasionally dousing hunters with healing items and drawing a monster’s attention while also laying traps and barrel bombs. The Seikret proves itself as a worthwhile ally during battle too, quickly scooping up players if they want to make a speedy exit while also carrying a pouch of surplus items and a way to quickly switch between your two equipped weapons. If you need any further assistance, letting off an SOS flare will open the door to other players joining your session. Failing that, NPC hunters will turn up.</p>
<p>Overall, the main questline in Monster Hunters Wilds is pretty easy for returning fans and won’t be too much of an obstacle between newcomers and the end credits. While some hunts felt like an absolute cakewalk, this isn’t such a bad thing.&nbsp;As much as I cherish them, those first two Monster Hunter games were punishing for solo players and required many long minutes of prep work and navigation before you even caught a whiff of your target, whereas Monster Hunter Wilds opens this potentially intimidating series up to more players through the gradual ramp of difficulty. It allows them to experience a wider spectrum of different monsters, locations, and mechanics without needing to grind away between each milestone, and that acts as a lure to the endgame.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for hardened hunters and new inductees alike, there’s a glut of challenging endgame content that will no doubt expand over time, hopefully leading into an inevitable expansion similar to Iceborne and Sunbreak.</p>
