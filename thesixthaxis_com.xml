		<p>Already a major hit with record-breaking franchise sales, EA has kicked off a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Free Trial. This is live now and running from today, 25th November, until 2nd December at 4 a.m. PT (12 p.m. UTC)</p>
<p>To play the Free Trial, you need to download the free-to-play Battlefield REDSEC, which will have access to more modes and maps granted for the coming week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 | Free Trial Week" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NllG1jzar4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Battlefield 6 Free Trial features a subset of the maps and modes in the full game, putting an emphasis on the Season 1 content, and obviously doesn’t include the single player campaign (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign/">but you can probably skip that</a>). Free-to-play players will get to check out&nbsp;Siege of Cairo, Blackwell Fields, and the newly released Eastwood, and get to try them out in modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, Team Deathmatch, and Sabotage.&nbsp;Of course, you also already have the free-to-play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">Battlefield REDSEC battle royale mode</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, there’s already cross-pollination of unlocks and levels. Anything unlocked in REDSEC can be used in the Free Trial, and anything you unlock in the Free Trial is kept and carried through should you buy the full game.</p>

<p>The timing of this is pretty much perfect for EA to capitalise on the missteps made by their biggest rival, and as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the US. It’s a great time to try and convince more people to join this shooter and not the other.</p>
