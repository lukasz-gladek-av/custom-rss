		<p>Pine Studios has announced a sequel to Escape Simulator, unsurprisingly called Escape Simulator 2. This new entry to the escape room genre will feature even more scenarios for players to figure their way out of, with up to eight players able to play together. The announcement trailer gives a look at what kind of environments players should expect in Escape Simulator 2.</p>

<p><em>“A sequel gives us the opportunity to start fresh and push the boundaries of the escape room genre. For Escape Simulator 2, we were inspired to explore darker themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle mechanics. This sequel also brings significant technical upgrades, including a new rendering engine, rewritten netcode, improved physics, and enhanced animations. While Escape Simulator 2 adopts a darker, more mysterious tone compared to the original, it’s not a horror game—there are no jump scares or gore. We love the Escape Simulator community and we plan to continue</em><br>
<em>supporting the original game while expanding and enhancing Escape Simulator 2 after its</em><br>
<em>launch”, </em>said Boris Barbir, Co-Founder at Pine Studio.</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will allow players to try and puzzle their way out of Dracula’s castle, a stranded spaceship, and look for cursed treasure. These are just three of the 12 scenarios that will be part of the base game. There will be a room editor too that will allow players to create their own puzzles and share them with the wider community. Escape Simulator will be available on PC via Steam.</p>

		<p>Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, a game that they describe as a turn-based beat ’em up coming to PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TMNT Tactical Takedown puts you in control of each of the four turtles as they take the fight to the Foot Clan in turn-based tactical battles. Each level drops your turtle into a small space with a bunch of enemies, charging you with dispatching all the foes as quickly as possible using their specific movesets to control the space and movement.</p>
<p>There’s some obvious parallels to Fights in Tight Spaces, and before that mini turn-based tactical Into the Breach as well, but those comparisons are hardly a bad thing. It just proves that this concept can work really, really well.</p>
<p>The game comes from Strange Scaffold, the developer behind I Am Your Beast, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more.</p>

<p>Studio founder Xalavier Nelson Jr. said, “Building a truly powerful licensed game requires a deep respect for the source material, love for the fans, and a willingness to challenge tentpoles of the universe to create something that both surprises and delights.</p>
<p>Bringing that kind of experience to life requires an equally powerful relationship – so I will be forever grateful to Doug Rosen and the team at Paramount for their collaboration, and putting their trust in our team to make an original take on the world that soars. I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?”</p>
<p>We’re in a rich period for TMNT fans and gamers, with the recent resurgence of the beat ’em up genre seeing the great new release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Shredder’s Revenge</a> and retro revival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">Cowabunga Collection</a>, as well as new genre spin-offs with the roguelike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>. Just avoid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review/">Wrath of the Mutants</a> – that one’s not a very good game…</p>
