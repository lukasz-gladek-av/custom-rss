		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for January 2025 have been announced, and Sony has chosen to start off the new year with… well, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Also some games that weren’t commercial and critical flops.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 7th January.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most celebrated game here is The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, a game that’s all about&nbsp;office worker Stanley discovered all of his co-workers had disappeared and wandering around to try and figure out what’s going on. All his actions (as controlled by you) are narrated by the Narrator, voiced by Kevan Brighting, in humourous ways as Stanley encounters weirder and weirder scenarios. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expands upon the original game with more content, choices, and secrets. The graphics have also been updated to take advantage of newer technology. It’s a brilliant game and well worth playing, whether for the first time or revisiting over a decade on from its original 2013 release.</p>

<p>Another game from the remaster/remake pile is Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered. This was the first game in the series helmed by Criterion, and it really showed off that studio’s arcade racer chops in style. Back in the day on PS3 and 360 it was only at 30fps, but with the remaster, the game’s running at a much better feeling 60fps. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/">review</a>.</p>


<p>And that brings us around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Released after years of delays, it failed to hit the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p>The game was one of the biggest flops of 2024 – probably neck and neck with Sony’s own Concord – and has recently been included in Steam sales for just £3, while Warner Bros. and Rocksteady have confirmed that its seasonal content will be ending <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">as soon as its pre-announced 1 year content roadmap has completed</a> with an update in mid-January. On the positive side of things, they’re patching in an offline mode, and PS Plus subscribers will be getting the game at its most content-filled…</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>

		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>We’ve made it once more around the Sun, putting 2024 behind us and looking forward to a 2025 that’s full of hope, optimism and brightness… OK, so this coming year (and the next four years, truth be told) are sure to instil a lot of fear and trepidation in a lot of people around the world, but if the real world is looking to be rather doomy and gloomy, at least we have games to look forward to. There’s even a new Doom!</p>
<p>On the gaming front, 2024 was a year with a lot of highs and lows. Perhaps more than any other year, this past twelve months were stacked with remakes and remasters, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a> really standing &nbsp;out as being the equal of new big budget games. And what games those were, as well? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">Palworld</a> made the start of the year about silly co-op action, the end of the year was really all about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, and a great Call of Duty in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a>, and it was all capped – Fedora’d? – off by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

<p>However, there’s been a lot of change across the industry this year. Ignominious flops in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> – the latter failing so badly that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Sony delisted the game and shut down the debutant studio</a> – made the risks of big budget game development and the expectations of live service games more apparent than ever. Meanwhile, major companies continued to make layoffs and shut down studios including Microsoft shuttering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks</a> (the latter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">rescued a few months later by Krafton</a>) and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin</a>, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">closing down XDefiant</a>, Meta closing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/meta-is-shutting-down-lone-echo-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn/">Ready at Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/mass-layoffs-hit-sony-interactive-entertainment-london-studio-shutting-down-naughty-dog-insomniac-also-affected/">London Studio closing</a>, and more.</p>

<p>It’s really saying something when one of the standout moments of The Game Awards wasn’t a GOTY acceptance speech or glitzy new trailer, but rather the highlighting of the work of Amir Satvat, setting up a community for the thousands affected by the mass layoffs.&nbsp;We really hope to see this downward trend turned around in the next year or two.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be a huge year for games, which ought to help a little. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">Nintendo will finally announce and presumably release the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there’s big upcoming games such as Ghost of Yotei, Doom: The Dark Ages, Civilization VII, Death Stranding 2 and, of course, Grand Theft Auto 6, and we’ll be here to cover them all as best we can.</p>

<p>And with that, it’s just left to me to wish you once again a very Happy New Year from the entire TSA team, to thank you for visiting our humble gaming site through the year, and to say we hope you’ll continue to join us for all your gaming news and reviews in 2025!</p>
