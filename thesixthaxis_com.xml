		<p>It both feels like an awful long time, and barely any real time at all since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control burst onto the scene in 2019</a>, putting Remedy Entertainment back on the map after their split with Microsoft and bringing millions of new fans into their expanding supernatural universe. Expectations are much higher for its recently announced sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONTROL Resonant – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Control Resonant was revealed at The Game Awards, putting a name to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">a sequel</a> that we knew was in development since all the way back in 2022.</p>


<p>Things have gone from bad to worse at The Oldest House and the Federal Bureau of Control, and salvation will come from another rather unlikely direction. After Jesse Faden found herself suddenly wrapped up into becoming the FBC’s Director, it’s now Dylan Faden, her brother who was confined at the FBC for years as the character P6, who has to fight back a mysterious cosmic entity.</p>


<p>This threat has been able to spill out of the confined of The Oldest House and into Manhattan, creating a large, but unfamiliar rendition of the world as the cosmic force reshapes the environment, breaks down laws of physics and reality, and even extends into Dylan’s psyche. It’s all a bit Doctor Strange and Inception in the announcement trailer, but expect it to get much more twisted and darker.</p>
<p>Luckily Dylan finds new powers awakening within him to fight back, with Jesse having disappeared. There looks to be more of a melee action adventure RPG tone to this, after the third person shooting of the original, but the snippets of gameplay from the reveal trailer look truly spectacular. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

<p>Control Resonant was originally announced back in November 2022 when Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> an agreement to co-develop and co-publish the new game. At that point Control 2, as it was known, was still in the initial pre-production concept stage, with an initial budget of €50 million.</p>
<p>Things changed in 2024 when Remedy Entertainment has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> franchise as a whole from 505 Games, including both the already-released 2019 game, and any future projects.&nbsp; Remedy asked for this freedom in order to give themselves a fresh chance to either self-publish the games or find a new publishing partner for these two games.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they did a few months later when Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> a strategic partnership which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>Control Resonant will launch in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Mac.</p>
<p><em>Alright, that’s all but one of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> accounted for. Can you figure out which title has landed in the top spot? Come back tomorrow for our chart topper to confirm or defy your expectations.</em></p>

		<p>There was a pleasant surprise for fans of Nintendo’s biggest hit of 2020, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> update 3.0.0 went live a day early!</p>
<p>Update 3.0.0 for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings a bunch of new features to the five year old game, alongside today’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> release and paid upgrade to bring more support for the new generation of Nintendo’s console. This update is all about the universal new features, with the paid DLC giving 4K support, Joy-Con 2 mouse mode and larger multiplayer lobbies to the game for Switch 2 players.</p>


<p>The free update has a major addition with a new resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel, but there’s also a big old list of quality of life improvements that includes an increased storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and the ability to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s now more! Nintendo hand-wave all of that previously announced stuff away and then include things like letting you craft using your home storage materials, purchasing up to 50 customization kits at once, additional Nook Miles tasks and more.</p>
