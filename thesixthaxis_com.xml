		<p>Tougher bosses are starting to appear in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> from today, as new variant Nightlords known as the Everdark Sovereigns emerge in FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off to the hit Soulslike.</p>
<p>A new Everdark Sovereign will be added to Limveld each week, a time-limited challenge for players who have defeated the boss in their original form to test themselves against. The reward for defeating them will be Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics, with additional Sigils awarded for the first time you defeat a particular Sovereign.</p>


<p>The First Everdark Sovereign is an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night known as Gaping Jaw, and is now available to play. You have until June 26 9:59 JST / 1:59 BST / 2:59 CEST / 5:59 PM PDT to take him on.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will emerge, while others –&nbsp;Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog – will be added to the rotation at a later date.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Everdark Sovereigns are only available to battle if you’re playing in online mode.</p>

<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>
