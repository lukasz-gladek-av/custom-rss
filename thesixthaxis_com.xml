		<p>The next Nintendo Direct is set to take place this week, Nintendo has announced, with a presentation dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scheduled for Wednesday 18th June at 2PM UK time.</p>
<p>“Tune in on Wednesday, June 18, for a livestreamed Donkey Kong Bananza Direct presentation,” the simple announcement reads in the Nintendo Today app. Adding the event to the in-app calendar also reveals that it will take place at 2PM.</p>


<p>And that’s the full extent of the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Announced back in April for the Switch 2 game and gameplay reveal</a>, Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay is understandably rather different to Rare’s 90s classic.&nbsp;There’s a big emphasis on DK’s massively strong, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with the game at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in Paris a couple days later, find a game that’s as smash-happy as you would have expected. From my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-preview-a-3d-platformer-with-a-lot-of-punch/">Donkey Kong Bananza hands on preview</a>, I said, “If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.”</p>

<p>This will be the first big game for the Nintendo Switch 2 following the console’s release at the start of this month. The Switch 2’s debut came alongside a must-have game in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a>, but the lineup has been rather thin outside of this. DK will lead the way for what will hopefully be a strong second half to the year, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and more on the way.</p>
