		<p>Developer emptyvessel has released an extended gameplay video of its upcoming 4v4v4v4 cyberpunk first person shooter DEFECT. In the game, you choose to play as a member of one of a number of factions including The System’s Police Force, Rogue Police, or a member of different gangs as each group attempts to complete its own objectives while sabotaging and defeating the others.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Extended Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0d9sqm5LX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this extended gameplay trailer for DEFECT, we open with the load in screen for The System’s police force where players vote on the objective to pursue and prepare their loadouts for the starting phase, though you can pick up and find other weapons in the matches too. The police’s mission here is to infiltrate Nodrog’s territory, whose voice can be heard taunting the force. During the footage you see switches to surveillance camera views, and this is how Nodrog is following the police’s moves. These cameras can be hacked to provide additional tactical advantages.</p>
<p>Players will have a variety of tools at their disposal like drones and scanners to scout out areas, and a tool called a Body Snatch. With Body Snatch, players can subdue enemies and then transfer a downed teammate’s consciousness into that body. In the video, we see this play out with a gang member being taken down and then joining the police due to their mind being taken over. There are also health stations dotted around maps, but they only have three charges and are usually in dangerous areas. Health does not regenerate so finding and defending these points is also a crucial element of matches in DEFECT. The final objective in this video is to reboot the building’s operating system, but emptyvessel has stated final objectives differ and can change depending on what is happening in matches.</p>

<p>This video just looks at DEFECT’s multiplayer PvP mode, though emptyvessel has confirmed it is also working on single player and co-op content for the game. A release date is yet to be confirmed for the game, with PC currently confirmed as the only platform with Steam Deck compatibility in the works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s something about handheld gaming that just seems to fit with tactical games. Nintendo in particular, have regularly married the two, with series like Fire Emblem forming part of the bedrock of their handheld gaming lineup for many years. So, while Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch is out for all the major platforms, it’s a natural for the Nintendo Switch, fusing Fire Emblem-esque strategy and storytelling with Roguelike progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9ScyPnAxU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That said, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch doesn’t make the best first impression on Nintendo Switch (by way of Switch 2’s compatibility layer), and a big part of that is in-game visuals. I initially started playing the game in handheld mode, and while the character artwork is detailed and characterful, the in-game visuals seemed very basic indeed. It looks better when you play docked, but it’s still pretty rough around the edges. It’s a testament to the quality of the gameplay that you’ll find yourself drawn into the tactical action, despite this, and the longer I spent with the game, the less I noticed.</p>


<p>There’s definitely a strong flavour of Fire Emblem in every gulp of Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. You move your team of characters around a grid, facing off against a slew of different enemies, and if you want to be successful, you have to consider positioning, weaponry types, weaknesses and individual strengths.</p>


<p>While Fire Emblem has a straightforward weapon triangle of strengths and weaknesses to consider, Veil of the Witch takes this a step further with weapons and armour types with paired affinities. That means that heavy armour is weak to axes, leather armour is weak to swords, and cloth armour is weak to spears and bows. Besides that, some larger creatures will have different weaknesses depending on their positioning, and you’ll pour a lot of thought into where you’re going to send your team.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s melee, ranged and magical attacks and support spells, as well as unique moves for each character. For all of these traditional trappings, the roguelike progression, and multiple runs into this fantasy world really do bring a newfound sense of freshness to the tactical action. Part of that comes down to decisions.</p>
<p>Every time your characters level up, you’re given two possible upgrades to equip them with, so you have to decide between better defence and improved attack, or enhanced movement and increased critical hit chance. Each run, there’s a chance to build them differently, and having that extra sword to spin makes Veil of the Witch consistently compelling.</p>

<p>Alongside levelling up, there’s further choices to be made following each battle. Here you can choose your route through the world, with an indication of the type of reward you’ll gain for heading in that direction,</p>
<p>Despite the repeated trips through the game world, there’s a story to be told, with Sable, the titular Eidolon, using your crew to further her own shadowy motives, bringing you back from the dead over and over again. While Veil of the Witch is often a little worthy, and there’s a lot of thou, thee and verily in the dialogue, you start to find the characters quietly endearing, learning more about them as you progress, often via one-to-one conversations back at your base.</p>
<p>Once again, that brings the Fire Emblem comparisons come even closer, but the feel and tone of Veil of the Witch is fundamentally very different from Intelligent Systems’ iconic franchise, and it absolutely stands as its own thing. It draws you in far more effectively than you might be expecting, and if you’re looking for a tactical RPG that is a little more respectful of your time, Veil of the Witch fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>Runs probably do run longer than you’d expect for the Roguelite genre. You’ll find battlefields that you thought you were finishing up suddenly beset by reinforcements, or small skirmishes where enemy fighters are repeatedly resurrected. These extend your time in certain battles, slowing your progress, especially when you’re facing an almost inevitable death. Equally, there’s as much challenge and depth to each encounter as you’ll find in the best of the genre, and there’s plenty of variation to the way that battles play out, with different conditions changing things up. Overall, I’d rather have the thoughtful, engaging strategy, rather than it becoming a frantic jog through multiple encounters.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/rockbeasts-is-a-band-management-sim-that-brings-back-the-mtv-era-with-fish-bassists-and-iggy-pop/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, you have to immediately talk about a game trailer you’ve seen. This is one of those times. During the Galaxies Steam Fest showcase, Team17 dropped a brand new announcement and reveal trailer for Rockbeasts, a band management sim, that looks to take the spirit of Bojack Horseman and Adult Swim and apply it to the world of MTV-era music management. It looks utterly brilliant, so, first things first, go have a look at it.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROCKBEASTS | Gameplay Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV4ULIZ6qyw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The immediate thing we obviously have to talk about is the cast of creatures. Fish bassists, deer guitarists, ostrich front-animals, and rabbit drummers adorn the artwork for the game, and their look gives you an impression of the irreverent take the team are going for. There’s lots of rock-centric attitude, plenty of drama, and some rhythm-action in there too, which has put it right to the top of my radar.</p>
<p>Coming from Polish two-man team Lichtund, the game aims to chart the highs and lows of being in a band, working your way through dive bars and tiny venues through to headlining your own stadium tour. That’s a very dry and basic task though, and you have to cope with ego-stroking, spoiled brats and a lot of sticky venues.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage Resources Managing Time (turn-based game)</li>
<li>Do Quests and Side Quests</li>
<li>Level up and get sweet gear</li>
<li>Customize your band and instruments</li>
<li>Plan and play Concerts (what songs you’ll play, what gear you’ll use (from smoke machines to disco balls, we’ve got it all), and even how the band will look on stage)</li>
<li>Unlock New Songs (a full soundtrack recorded in a studio and performed by the voice actors)</li>
<li>Experience branching narratives across 17 episodes where your choices make a difference</li>
<li>No two playthroughs are the same!</li>
</ul>
<p>This awesome-looking dark comedy has been written by acclaimed video game writer Jakub Szamałek (Senior writer on The Witcher 3, Principal Writer of Cyberpunk 2077, and the upcoming The Blood of Dawnwalker). It’s also fully voiced and features some very recognisable voices, including the iconic Iggy Pop.</p>
<p>It’s available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/ROCKBEASTS/?hsCtaAttrib=210178644193">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Xbox right now, with Nintendo Switch listings coming soon!</p>

		<p>For Fallout Day, Bethesda Game Studios brought some updates on the Fallout franchise and mark some of the milestones that the series has passed. In particular, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, the company announced: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition will arrive on 10th November (and 2026 for Switch 2!), and there’s a physical 15th anniversary bundle for Fallout New Vegas on the way as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWVT9eYOPas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/skyrim-anniversary-edition-ps5-free-upgrade-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ps4/">Skyrim: Anniversary Edition from 2021</a>,&nbsp;<strong><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></strong> bundles the game and all its official add-ons together with over 150 mods of Creation Club content, looking to create a curated ultimate collaboration between the original developers and the community.</p>
<p>Creations are coming to Fallout 4 broadly through the new in-game Creations menu, which will make it easier to discover and download more mods as well.</p>
<p>The Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, and PC this year, with a Switch 2 release set for 2026. There will also be an Anniversary Upgrade for existing platforms, and Game Pass and PS Plus subscribers will also have upgrade options.</p>

<p>Another anniversary is being celebrated for Fallout: New Vegas, which is turning 15 this year. There’s no new port of the game (sadly), but Bethesda has created a new physical Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary Bundle, which is probably already out of stock on the Bethesda Gear Store.</p>
<p>The bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition PC Code</strong></li>
<li><strong>Victor Statue (8″ PVC):</strong> The friendly Securitron stands tall and is ready to roll</li>
<li><strong>Doc Mitchell’s Evaluation Cards (8×8 cardstock set):</strong> Straight from your first moments in Goodsprings, a true piece of New Vegas history</li>
<li><strong>Vault Boy Enamel Pin (1.5″):</strong> Vault Boy stacks the odds with poker chips in hand</li>
<li><strong>Mojave Express Patch (3.5″ × 1.9″):</strong> Woven, iron-on, and full of wasteland charm</li>
<li><strong>NCR Recon Patch (3.25″ × 3.5″):</strong> Woven, iron-on insignia of the New California Republic’s finest</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Big Box:</strong> A throwback-style display box created exclusively for the anniversary</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s Fallout 76, with more details on the Burning Springs update which will arrive on 2nd December, and introduce a new region in Ohio where you’ll battle the Rust King and desert Deathclaws.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In good news for this game, native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are on the way for next year.</p>
<p>And finally, Fallout Shelter is getting new updates in the form of Seasons:</p>
<p>“Inspired by Vault-Tec’s experiments, Seasons introduces limited-time Vaults to the game that are completely separate from your original Vault. Each Season will have a unique theme, bringing new challenges and rewards as players hit different milestones.”</p>
