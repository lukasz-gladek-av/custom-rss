		<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Star Wars Zero Company</a> which is in development with BitReactor and Respawn on board. The initial reveal just told us that we would get more news this weekend, and that moment has arrived with the game’s first trailer along with the first details. What it confirms is that Star Wars Zero Company will be a turn based tactics game, looking a bit like XCOM, set during the final stages of The Clone Wars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows Hawks, a former Republic Officer, and his group known as Zero Company. All of the Zero Company members are essentially mercenaries for hire from across the galaxy, with each of them having their own skills. You have a droid that will be to able to hack systems, a Jedi that has Force abilities, a Mandalorian armed with all the gadgets, a Clone Trooper, and what looks like some kind of assassin. They are not the best of friends and will have their own differences to work out between themselves. We get a brief look of gameplay in the reveal trailer and that shows the turn based tactical element of Star Wars Zero Company, from positioning your characters to using their abilities in the most efficient way to take out enemies. When not in a fight, Hawks and Zero Company will set up a base of operations to gather intelligence from across the galaxy using informants who will point them to targets.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Star WarsZero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.”</p>
<p>“At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to&nbsp;Star Wars.”</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is set to released in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC. The game is available to wishlist now.</p>

		<p>I hope you’re all well stocked up in your fridges and cupboards with enough hot cross buns, chocolate eggs and all the other essentials for the long weekend. It’s always a touch confusing trying to figure out if Easter will mean that everything’s completely shutting down or just on Sunday hours… so why risk it? At least today is a regular day where you can grab any extra bits and bobs. After all, using as much of the free time as possible to play games is hard work and you need some snacks!</p>

Meanwhile, Ade dug through the archives to hunt for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/playing-with-history-the-real-life-indys-who-inspired-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/"><strong>some of the inspirations for Indy’s archeological adventuring</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>

<li><strong>TSBonyman </strong>completed the first planet in My Little Universe, but has now become obsessed with Blue Prince. The room drafting and puzzles have even infested his dreams!</li>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> is waiting to play Blue Prince with his daughter, and has been struggling once more with the fleeting nature of time and the PlayStation Plus library, enjoying the start of Disco Elysium until it vanished from the library before he could finish it. Yet another one to buy from a sale sometime…</li>
