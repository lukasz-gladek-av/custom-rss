<p>One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 released back in 2020, and in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/27/one-piece-pirate-warriors-4-review/">One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 review,&nbsp;</a>Miguel said, <em>“One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is a fan’s dream game, as it takes the iconic battles and moments of eight major story arcs and puts you right in the action like never before. Combat is fun and flashy while still managing to be surprisingly thoughtful, and although a few characters aren’t a joy to control, a majority of the cast is an absolute delight to play as. One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is a jolly good time.”</em></p>
<p>While new content is good to see for an older game, fans may be wanting to see One Piece Warriors 5 in the near future.</p>

		<p>Konami and developer ZDT Studio have released a new gameplay trailer for the side scrolling adventure game Darwin’s Paradox, in which players take control of a very intelligent octopus. The new trailer also brings with it two bits of news. First, Darwin’s Paradox has been delayed to 2026 and no specific release window has been given. Second, Darwin’s Paradox will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin’s Paradox! | Gameplay Trailer | KONAMI (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FF8l7UJox-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay trailer for Darwin’s Paradox shows our heroic blue octopus navigate his way around a large industrial area after being taken from his home in the ocean. Players are going to have to use Darwin’s skills to navigate dangerous locations and evade people who will try to capture him, using skills like walking on ceilings and camouflage. The trailer shows various threats Darwin will have to deal with including factories full of fire, rats, and what appears to be quite a hungry seagull.</p>
<p>Darwin’s Paradox will be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed once again after missing its amended release date of October 31st, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-to-october-31st/">been previously pushed back from a September 5th release date.</a> The new release date is December 12th. The reason for the delay this time is due to Reef Entertainment needing to put together the physical editions of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and that will take some effort.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE – Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CIxmLUoLZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment said, <em>“First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey. <wbr>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions, which we need some time to do. <wbr>Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: NO FATE to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em><wbr>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don’t take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we’re almost there.<wbr>Thank you again for standing by us. We’re incredibly grateful, and we can’t wait for you to finally experience Terminator 2D: NO FATE soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>
