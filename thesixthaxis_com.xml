		<p>One quarter of the way into February, and it’s all been kicking into high gear with two of the most anticipated games of the year launching this week – OK, so one&nbsp;has entered into that silly pre-order early access phase, but you can buy and play it now. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Catch our KCD2 review now,</a> but you’ll have to wait a little for our thoughts on Civ 7.</p>

<h2>In the News This Week</h2>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week? Well…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> popped his head into the comments to regale us with tales of No Man’s Sky’s Worlds 2 update, which has done wonderful stuff for the landscape variety and underwater – “I’ve explored my first gas giant and experienced storms that lifted me quite literally and threw me around like a kite.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

		<p>PlayStation Network is suffering a major outage, affecting the full gamut of online services that it provides.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 12PM 08/02</strong> – PSN has now been offline for at least 12 hours. Not exactly breaking news, but noteworthy.</em></p>


<p>it seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PSN</a> dropped offline just before midnight in the UK, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">DownDetector noting a huge spike</a> of reported issues. That naturally tailed off as people went to bed, but our own PlayStations are reporting that PSN is offline as of 9:30AM GMT.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network status page is red across the board including account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and even PlayStation Direct.</p>


<p>I think the “some services” is understating things a little, Sony…</p>
<p>So, if you were hoping to get some online gaming in this Saturday morning, you might need to turn on a PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch or change plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XDFKfdi84Co">watch the 24/7 Tom &amp; Jerry anniversary stream instead</a>. I suppose you could always play something single-player instead.</p>
<p>We’ll try to keep an eye on things and update this page when PSN comes back.</p>
