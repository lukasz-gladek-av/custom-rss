		<p>Tower survivor roguelite Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has been given a release date by Ludogram and Raw Fury, with the game coming on November 20th. There is a demo available on Steam, which will remain available even after the game is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road you need to defend a moving city from an endless army of monsters that want to tear the city down. To fight back, you need to gather resources like wood, stone, and gold to use to invest in defences, upgrades, and abilities to take on threats from small monsters to big bosses.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters are Coming! so it’s time to get this addictive Tower-Survivor rolling</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, Stefan wrote, <em>“Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.”</em></p>

<p>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road will be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, it has been verified for Steam Deck and the Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

		<p>The Adepta Sororitas are coming to dish out the Emperor’s justice in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, with the boomer shooter sequel letting you choose between the returning Space Marine Malum Caedo, and new character Nyra Veyrath, one of the Sisters of Battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 - Sister of Battle Extended Cut Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MAMOJqgiaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sisters of Battle are more than capable of holding their own in battle, despite having nowhere near the augmentations of the Adeptus Astartes – it’s all mad religious fervour and zeal powering their combat prowess.</p>
<p>In Boltgun 2, Nyra doesn’t have the same level of armour as a Space Marine, but she’s much more agile and can use speed, precision and just setting everything on fire to get ahead.</p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving you a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

		<p>Lunar Software and Raw Fury have announced that the sci-fi horror Routine will be released on December 4th for PC and Xbox consoles,and Game Pass, marking the announcement with a brand new trailer. In a statement Lunar Software said, <em>“Today is a very special day for us, as we are excited to announce that ROUTINE will launch on 4th December on Steam and Xbox platforms. The journey has been long, tough, and emotional, but also extremely rewarding. We’re really happy that before the year is over, you’ll be able to experience the game that we have dedicated our lives to for so long.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHB0L55bL0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lunar Software has been working on Routine since 2013 though the game disappeared from the public eye for a long time, getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">&nbsp;re-revealed in 2022. </a>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat. Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong>&nbsp;– Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay&nbsp;</strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong>&nbsp;– The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown&nbsp;</strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 has just launched, the next few months promising three phases of added content to the hit first person shooter. Titled Rogue Operations, it brings three new weapons, a new map, a new close quarters and a new mode called Strikepoint. There’s also a battle pass, and this is all launching alongside the new REDSEC free-to-play battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 1 Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Umw-SKuh0LY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new map is Blackwell Fields, which brings us one of the largest maps in the game, set in the arid biome of Southern California. It brings plenty of vehicular action – with the Traverser Mark 2 armoured truck –&nbsp;lots of long range sniping opportunity, and will go a good step toward addressing one of the main complaints of the launch line up of maps.</p>
<p>Alongside this is Strikepoint, which is a squad-based elimination mode, pitting two teams of 4 against one another as they battle over a single capture point.</p>
<p>Of course, then there’s tons of cosmetics and unlocks through the themed battle pass, which has 100 tiers (some free, many premium), 6 paths to choose and 10 prestige tiers for the most dedicated players. That comes alongside a big batch of new weekly missions in the game (sadly many of them locked to the battle royale modes) to help boost your standard progressions and levelling.</p>

<p>Two more content updates are coming in the next 6 weeks, with California Resistance launching on 18th November and Winter Offensive launching on 9th December. The first of these brings a new map set in the SoCal suburbs and a new Sabotage game mode, while Winter Offensive will redress one of the New York maps to be all wintry. And then it’s on to 2026 and Season 2.</p>
<p>Catch the full patch notes for update 1.1.1.0 here:</p>

		<p>Ice Pick Lodge and Hooded Horse have revealed Darkwood 2 during the ID@Xbox showcase, with the game confirmed for PC and Game Pass, though a release date is not yet confirmed. Darkwood 2 is going to be set a few years after Darkwood. You can check out the announcement trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Darkwood 2 says, <em>“In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly – an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why – retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature. All around lie the ruins of a vanished world – deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night – even walls can’t guarantee safety. As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder – is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/14/darkwood-review/">Darkwood Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Darkwood review, Steve said, <em>“Darkwood is one of the most terrifying games I’ve ever played as it challenges you to explore and survive a dark and twisted world. Unravelling the mysteries of the night time horrors will consume you even before you try the permadeath mode. This comes highly recommended, but remember to wear your brown trousers.”</em></p>

		<p>There is a new action RPG coming to town with ChillyRoom announcing Loulan: The Cursed Sand, which is set to come to PC and PS5, though a release date is yet to be set. Players take on the role of a skeletal warrior that has a sand form, which in turn provides some sand based combat powers to take on the various enemies that will be attacking him.</p>

<p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand is set in China along the ancient Silk Road where the lost kingdom of Loulan is located with its ruins piercing the sand. The story focuses on the skeletal warrior, a fallen Royal Guard, who has returned to the fallen kingdom to find his love who is also the princess. The description from the development team about Loulan: The Cursed Sand says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cursed Warrior of Dual Forms:&nbsp;</strong>Control the skeletal warrior “The&nbsp;Cursed Sand”, freely switching between bone and sand forms to experience entirely different combat styles and story interactions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic Melee Combat Against Many:&nbsp;</strong>Engage in grounded, one-against-many melee battles from a dynamic top-down perspective, where terrain design, enemy composition, and combat mechanics intertwine to test your skill and strategy.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Diverse and Creative Sand Abilities:&nbsp;</strong>Learn and wield unique sand abilities to solve puzzles, explore intricate levels, and experiment with multiple combat styles and tactical approaches.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Formidable Elites and Bosses:&nbsp;</strong>Face thrilling one-on-one encounters with powerful elite enemies and colossal bosses that challenge your mastery and reflexes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ancient Western Fantasy World:&nbsp;</strong>Explore a mysterious world inspired by the lost Kingdom of Loulan along the Silk Road, featuring diverse regions and atmospheric, handcrafted levels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ChillyRoom has stated that it is working on planning the localisation of Loulan: The Cursed Sand into different languages, and will have more details when those plans are finalised.</p>
