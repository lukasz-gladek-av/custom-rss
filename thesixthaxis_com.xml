		<p>PlayStation Network is suffering a major outage, affecting the full gamut of online services that it provides.</p>
<p>it seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PSN</a> dropped offline just before midnight in the UK, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">DownDetector noting a huge spike</a> of reported issues. That naturally tailed off as people went to bed, but our own PlayStations are reporting that PSN is offline as of 9:30AM GMT.</p>


<p>The PlayStation Network status page is red across the board including account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and even PlayStation Direct.</p>


<p>I think the “some services” is understating things a little, Sony…</p>
<p>So, if you were hoping to get some online gaming in this Saturday morning, you might need to turn on a PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch or change plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XDFKfdi84Co">watch the 24/7 Tom &amp; Jerry anniversary stream instead</a>. I suppose you could always play something single-player instead.</p>
<p>We’ll try to keep an eye on things and update this page when PSN comes back.</p>
