		<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future.</p>
<p>The name might sound familiar, as a trademark that Sony registered a little while back. This game has been in development since 2020 and is expected to launch for PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>Intergalactic casts players as Jordan A. Mun (played by Tati Gabrielle), a bounty hunter stranded near Sempiria, a planet that was cut off from the rest of the galaxy hundreds of years ago. There’s a pretty simple goal here, it seems, to collect bounties, and to escape orbit and get out into the real galaxy once more.</p>
<p>“Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps,” Neil Druckmann said, revealing the game on the PlayStation Blog. He continued,&nbsp;“This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.”</p>

<p>The focus will be just as much on characters and emotional storytelling as Naughty Dog’s last few games, with a broad ensemble cast that’s yet to be revealed – we’d put money on Troy Baker having some role, though. The soundtrack will come from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as you can hear in the trailer.</p>
<p>The game leans in on retro-futuristic tech, with a snazzy Porsche space ship, featuring more than a few CRT screens, Sony multi-disc CD player, puffy Cyberpunk-y jackets, and all the rest. Plenty of familiar fodder, but we’re very keen to see how Naughty Dog can weave a rich tapestry around this – after all, The Last of Us is an all-time great game, but it’s built around a very zombie apocalypse adjacent world and setting.</p>

		<p>Adhoc Games had a reveal trailer for Dispatch at The Game Awards, a superhero workplace comedy from the writers and directors of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright.</p>
<p>There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but there’s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>
