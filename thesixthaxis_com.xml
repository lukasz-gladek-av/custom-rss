		<p>A new sole drop event has now started in Pokemon TCG Pocket, with players able to take part in the Lapras ex Drop Event. This event is focused on the solo battles portion of the game, where players face off against the AI in order to complete challenges. Much like other solo events, the Lapras ex Drop event has four tiers to it, which are beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert.</p>

<p>For the first two levels, beginner and intermediate, it seems the only rewards you get are tokens and shinedust. However, on the advanced and expert battles you get access to winning a Promo Pack A Series Vol.1 pack, which contains one of five promo cards. These are Butterfree, Pikachu, Mankey, Clefairy, or Lapras ex. You will only get one card out of these packs and I, unfortunately, got two Mankeys. Your luck may be better. This event is running until the 18th of November.</p>
<p>The Lapras ex drop event is running alongside the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/01/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-event-part-1-has-started/">Pokemon TCG Pocket Wonder Pick Event Part 1</a>, in which players have the opportunity to pick promo A Chansey and promo A Meowth from Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>
