		<p>Bethesda’s bringing some goodies to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, following up on announcements last year with release dates and a shadow drop. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-4">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> is out this month on 24th February, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s</a> ambitious Switch 2 port will arrive in on 12th May, and it’s also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> will arrive on Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="These Bethesda Softworks games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-M-B7X_E2R0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fallout 4’s port to Nintendo Switch 2 ought to be the more straightforward one. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition is an upgraded bundle of the decade old RPG, combining the base game with all its official add-ons and a curated set of 150 Creation Club game mods. This is a feature match for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-for-its-10th-birthday/">the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC version that launched last year</a>.</p>
<p>While the mods will add a heftier burden to the game’s visuals (and Bethesda aren’t exactly known for the optimisation of their RPGs), we’d hope that they strike a good balance with Fallout 4. Certainly, it needs to be better than the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-switch-2-review/">Switch 2 launch of Skyrim</a>, which had bags of added latency that needed hurried patches to take the worst off.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, though, is much more ambitious. Originally released for Xbox Series X|S and PC in December 2024, before being ported to PS5 last April, it’s a current gen game that features ray traced global illumination for its light and shadow throughout. The Switch 2 hardware does support ray tracing, but its GPU comes in shy of the minimum bar that MachineGames set for the game on PC or Series S. That said, idTech is often fantastically well-optimised for all manner of system specs, so hopefully they can sprinkle some magic dust on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now across Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review of the main game</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

		<p>Capcom games were sprinkled through the Nintendo Direct today, the company has announced that demoes for two of their upcoming games will drop onto Nintendo Switch 2 today. If you’re curious to see what Pragmata and Monster Hunter Stories 3 are like, then you can grab a demo and find out!</p>
<p>It’s also been confirmed that the <a href="https://xcancel.com/PRAGMATAgame/status/2019416240972779807#m">Pragmata</a> demo is available across all its launch platforms, so Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and (already) PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection – Demo Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2paOXQxE3dc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’ve been hands on with both, starting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-stories-3">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-takes-the-series-mythology-in-a-new-and-exciting-direction/">Dom was able to check out last year</a>. He said, “Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is the obvious next step for the series. That’s taking the graphics and the turn-based action up a notch, while expanding the world of Monster Hunter into newfound territory. The previous two games have given fans a totally different take on the mythology and magic of the series’ iconic creatures, and on early impressions alone, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection looks as though it’s going to carry on that tradition.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> at a Nintendo preview event last week, coming away pretty happy with how the game’s inventive sci-fi puzzle action handled on the console. I’ve written, “Darkness hides a lot of necessary evils in Resident Evil Requiem, but playing through the Sketchbook demo on Switch 2 places Hugh and Diana in a very brightly lit, clean environment, and that doesn’t help matters. There’s maybe some fuzzy upscaling that’s noticeable, there’s 3D model detail that’s reduced far enough to be reminiscent of the moulded look that PS3 era normal mapping presented, and the like. The visual cuts were pretty clear to me when playing on TV, but hopping into the game in handheld mode helped to max them a bit more, and the game was still nice and smooth to play in both settings.”</p>

<p>Rounding out the previews for Capcom, there was a new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, showcasing both Grace and Leon gameplay, as well as reconfirming that it will launch alongside ports of Resident Evil 7 and Village on 27th February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 3rd June 2026, arriving just half a year after the port of the opening entry in the trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH – Coming June 3rd (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKTuMgINNg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally released as a PlayStation 5 exclusive in 2024, it’s great to see Square Enix moving so quickly to bring the middle entry to more platforms.</p>
<p>Looking back on our review at the time, Nic said, “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love. It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>
<p>We have high hopes of how this game will perform. In our review of the first port, Dom said, “The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade arrives in stunning form, with very few compromises made bringing it across to Nintendo’s newest hardware. It’s an essential purchase for RPG fans who haven’t had the chance to play this reimagined saga.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Orbitals looks like a 90s anime It Takes Two, coming exclusively to Switch 2 this summer]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/orbitals-looks-like-a-90s-anime-it-takes-two-coming-exclusively-to-switch-2-this-summer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Reappearing during the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Orbitals is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026, and it looks like an early 90s anime riff on the beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> style co-op adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orbitals – An intergalactic co-op adventure! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-bEqd-W8eE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The graphical style really shines through here, really capturing the look and feel of classic Japanese animation to go alongside the familiar looking split-screen co-op. The game sees explorers Maki and Omura setting out from their home to try and save it from an impending cosmic storm. They’ll be making use of separate abilities to support each others’ adventuring, using things like a grapple gun to pull out platforms, or cool lava with a water gun.</p>
<p>The game can also be played across multiple systems using GameShare, so you don’t have to play on TV or with a single Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Announced back at The Game Awards (where we sadly missed its reveal), the game is in development by Tokyo-based indie team Shapefarm, but with assistance from animation house Studio Massket to craft its cutscenes. The game will have both Japanese and English audio dubs.</p>
