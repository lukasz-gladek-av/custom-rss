		<p>3D Realms and Anshar Studio have announced that Painkiller will get a roguelike mode called Rogue Angel, the day the game launches. This new mode is separate to the story mode and will take players to an area of Purgatory where the levels are procedurally generated which are home to a mix of bosses. Players will be able to collect weapons, tarot cards, and items as they progress through the levels to take on the challenges that will lay ahead.</p>

<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven. The way to redeem yourself is by blasting away the demons of purgatory in an attempt to stop the fallen angel Azazel’s invasion of Earth. Painkiller can be playable solo and will also support co-op for up to three players.</p>
<p>There are two versions of Painkiller available for pre-order including the standard version and the deluxe edition. The standard edition is priced at €39.99/£34.99 with a pre-order bonus of the Iron Crusade skin pack. This pack includes skins for all four of the game’s characters, who are Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. The Iron Crusade pack also has skins for six of the game’s weapons, with those being the Electrodriver, Stakegun, Shotgun, SMG, Hand Cannon and Rocket Launcher. You can check out the weapons in action&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/painkillers-latest-trailer-showcases-some-of-its-weapons/">Painkiller’s last trailer that showcased t</a>hem.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes expansion, with this new content looking like it will be bringing in the Mangkwan Clan, also known as the Ash People. This clan is going to be focal point of the next Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash. In terms of release date, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes will be launching on December 19th, a few days after Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash hits cinemas.</p>

<p>This won’t be the only content coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in December either. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">A third person patch</a> was confirmed earlier this year, with a release date pencilled in for December 5th. The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person. In addition, Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. Now we know there will be some new enemies to take on.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, <em>“Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</em></p>
