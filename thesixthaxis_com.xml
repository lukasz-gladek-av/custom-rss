		<p>One of the most welcome surprises of the last six months was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This turn-based RPG, managed to out-JRPG the Japanese, with French team Sandfall Interactive putting together an exquisitely-crafted turn-based adventure with the kind of production values and storytelling normally reserved for Square Enix and Final Fantasy. It’s fair to say that it hit home with plenty of players too, and the team have just announced the incredible milestone of 5 million players, worldwide, who’ve set out on that thirty-third expedition. As a ‘thank you’ to all those players, Sandfall Interactive have announced today that they’ll be releasing a massive new DLC package, bringing new areas, content and brand-new boss battles to the game.</p>

<p>As one of the best games of the year, it’s such good news that we’re going to be getting even more Clair Obscur, especially when it’s not just the game that’s been a massive hit, with the orechestral soundtrack racking up a huge 333 million listens as well! We loved it here at TSA Towers, and Gamoc scored it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">insane 10/10</a>, saying “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a beautiful experience that excels in almost every area – the combat and character skill customisation is some of the most intricate I’ve seen, the storyline is routinely surprising and emotional, characterisation and performances are immaculate, and it both looks and sounds absolutely stunning all the time. It’s a stunning accomplishment for Sandfall Interactive’s first game, and with a core team of around 30 (with outsourced help). It’s sure to be in contention for Game of the Year awards, and anyone not playing it is seriously missing out.”</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li>
<li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li>
<li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
<li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to!</li>
</ul>
<p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” says Guillaume Broche, Creative Director of Expedition 33 at Sandfall Interactive. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support – please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now for PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC. If you hurry, it’s currently on offer on PS5 too, bringing its price in line with the PC version.</p>
