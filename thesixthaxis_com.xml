		<p>PUBG remains one of the best online multiplayer shooter experiences going. I’m not sure what that says about more modern releases, but still, if you’re looking for the truest battle royale experience out there, you want to play PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. Part of that ongoing popularity comes from the teams’ constant stream of updates and patches over the year, and update 38.1 has just dropped today for PC, with consoles not that far behind, with the update due to follow on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on October 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="Patch Report #38.1 | SMG Nerfs, Destructible Terrain on Miramar, and Halloween Collab Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2iaopdqRSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The October update introduces a limited-time Halloween collaboration mode featuring the globally popular YouTube animation IP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">Skibidi Toilet</a>, a new Contender character, and a series of gunplay and gameplay improvements, including updates to SMGs, vehicles, and map mechanics. You can find the full patch notes below!</p>



<h2 id="patch-notes3" data-renderer-start-pos="23474">Gameplay</h2>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23484">Vehicles &amp; Special Vehicle Skins</h3>
<p><span id="isPasted">Update 38.1 brings broad adjustments to vehicles and Special Vehicle skins.</span></p>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23600">A similar level of window tint has been applied to the front and rear windows of base vehicles, matching those of Special Vehicle skins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23740">The driving experience has been improved for the following vehicles and Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="2">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23838">Dacia, Mirado, Coupe RB, “The Good Ol’ Days (Black)” Sedan, “The Good Ol’ Days (White)” Sedan</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23937">Special Vehicle Skins</h4>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23960">When equipping Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24001">All vehicle windows can now be penetrated by bullets, regardless of skin type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24083">All vehicles now share the same wide, consistent penetrable area at the rear, regardless of design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">&lt;Dev’s comment&gt;</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Across the vast Battlegrounds, vehicles serve as more than just a means of transportation—they are vital strategic elements that can shape the outcome of survival and combat. The PUBG development team has always valued the unique experiences and tactical depth that vehicles bring to the game. As Special Vehicle skins also serve to expand the joy of PUBG, we’ve collaborated with premium car brands to deliver realistic, immersive experiences that capture the essence of driving within the Battlegrounds.</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Throughout the development of Special Vehicle skins, we have always prioritized maintaining identical driving performance to their base vehicles. We’ve also worked to maintain balance in vehicle hit areas by allowing penetration based on material type, ensuring that combat remains as fair as possible. However, as more Special Vehicle skins have been introduced over time, we began to notice that the differences in size and shape were creating slight advantages or disadvantages in actual engagements, an unintended outcome that diverged from our original goal of offering purely visual variety. As players’ skills and understanding of vehicles have grown, these disparities have become more pronounced, revealing a growing imbalance that could no longer be overlooked. We recognized that adhering solely to our original policy of equal performance was no longer enough to address this issue. Since these discrepancies could directly impact survival and fairness, we saw this as a crucial matter that required fundamental action. Therefore, rather than making adjustments to specific skins, we decided to take a comprehensive look at the entire vehicle system—including previously released vehicles—and make improvements.</em></p>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="27702"><em data-renderer-mark="true">In this update, we’ve implemented improvements in two key areas. First, we refined the overall driving experience of base vehicles and adjusted window transparency to make seated players less visible from the outside, narrowing the gameplay gap between base vehicles and Special Vehicle skins. At the same time, we’ve adjusted the hit areas of Special Vehicle skins to closely match those of the base vehicles, ensuring a fair and consistent experience regardless of which vehicle or skin players choose. These standards will continue to apply to all future Special Vehicle skins.&nbsp;<span data-renderer-mark="true" data-text-custom-color="#00b8d9">However, the Bugatti Special Vehicle skins were not included in this update, as no adjustments were required in relation to the changes made in this patch. (The balance of all Special Vehicle skins is subject to change depending on development progress.)</span></em></p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28539"><em data-renderer-mark="true">We understand that these changes may alter some aspects of the familiar experience, but we believe they are a necessary step toward maintaining a fair competitive environment. We will continue to listen closely to player feedback and remain committed to creating a more balanced and enjoyable Battleground for everyone. As always, we appreciate your feedback and thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="26919">Recall System</h3>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="26942">The registration time at the Blue Chip Tower now scales with the number of Blue Chips.</p>
<ul data-indent-level="2">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27032">Each additional Chip adds 5 seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27074">Information regarding players returning to the Battleground is now provided through system messages and the Match Log.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27196">On 8×8 km maps, the Recall flight will appear one fewer time and will no longer appear from Phase 6 onwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="27308">UX/UI</h4>
<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27317">The countdown message for the Recall flight has been removed from the spectator view, and the remaining time is now displayed at the top of the Minimap and the bottom right of the World Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27511">Recall-related system messages now follow the same format as regular system messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27600">Some recall-related UI messages have been updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: Since the Recall system was introduced to Ranked and Esports, it has given eliminated players a second chance and had a significant impact on the overall flow of gameplay. To ease the fatigue that can come from repeated recalls, we’re making a few adjustments in this update. With these changes, recalling multiple teammates at once now carries greater risk. Players can also view other teams’ recall information, which creates new opportunities for strategic play. In addition, recalls are now limited in the late game so that the feature mainly serves as a recovery option for players eliminated early. We’ll continue working to give players more intense and strategic choices in every stage of the match.</em></p>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="28378">Miscellaneous</h3>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28461"><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: With Update 38.1, we’re applying a series of adjustments to SMGs and the Panzerfaust. SMGs have been on a steady rise, and while we want to preserve their core strengths—low recoil and close-range dominance—we felt their stability when firing from the hip, without aiming over the shoulder or using scopes, was a bit too strong. To address this, we’ve made changes to improve balance in those situations. We’ve also reduced the damage of the MP5K, which has shown a noticeably higher usage rate than other SMGs. Its TTK (Time to Kill) will remain the same at close range, but you’ll feel a clear increase in TTK at longer distances. These changes are aimed at keeping SMGs an appealing choice for close-quarters combat while maintaining healthy weapon variety across the Battlegrounds. As for the Panzerfaust, which has long been known for its overwhelming firepower, we’ve introduced several penalties to its handling and damage potential. True to its nature as a large, heavy weapon, movement is now more restricted when it’s equipped, adding a layer of risk to its use. We’ve also increased the sight deployment sound and reduced the damage it does to players inside vehicles, giving players more opportunities to respond to Panzerfaust attacks.</em></p>

We’ve been gradually rolling out terrain destruction to multiple maps. With this update, players can now enjoy creating new cover strategies not only on Rondo, Sanhok, and Taego, but also on Miramar. These changes aim to bring Miramar’s gameplay experience more in line with other maps. Please note that the Destructible Buildings feature, which currently exists only on Sanhok, is not planned for other maps at this time.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’ve never even heard of the 1970s manga ‘Cobra’ and the anime movie – ‘Space Adventure Cobra’ – and TV show that spawned from it, then don’t worry; me either. What I came to learn is that Cobra is absolutely brilliant, it’s self-indulgent, silly sci-fi at its finest. An over-the-top tale in which a Han Solo-like hero called Cobra, an intergalactic adventurer no less, travels the galaxy battling the villainous Pirate Guide – whose numbers include the superbly named Crystal Bowie. Well, Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening is the video game of that story, a 2D side-scrolling Metroid-lite shoot ‘em up that does a lot of things well, and just as many things badly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Adventure Cobra - The Awakening - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qur4Wfmu-BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening absolutely nails is the look and feel of an 80’s matinee cartoon. Footage from the original anime is interspersed with the gameplay, giving a satisfying, cohesive feel to proceedings, as well as a strong narrative flow. The game is smartly structured around a TV episode format, welcomingly aping the TV show that inspired it. Other than the original footage, the rest of the story is told via talking heads and text boxes, with dialogue kept pleasantly short, keeping the focus firmly on the gameplay.</p>


<p>The animation for Cobra himself is fantastic; he moves like a character from GI-Joe or Thundercats. Our red spandex-clad hero is all about dynamic comic book poses, demonstrating plenty of effortless style as he slides and dashes across each stage, blasting away with his Pychogun. Enemy types don’t fair nearly as well, however. Most are bland, colour palette swapped and near indistinguishable henchman, whilst bosses fall too often into small metallic drone tedium. The game singularly fails to give you anything interesting to shoot at, but thankfully the shooting itself is rather fun.</p>


<p>Along with all the regular run and gun, which has a distinctive Samus feel, Cobra is able to use his pychogun to entertaining and unique effect. After charging a meter, you can launch a special laser attack that briefly freezes time, whilst you steer the energy beam in a manner rather reminiscent of playing Snake on your old brick Nokia. Steer your laser strategically and you can nimbly dodge obstacles and take out numerous enemies in one hugely satisfying blast, Cobra congratulating himself – and you – as he does so.</p>
<p>This gameplay mechanic leads to some great moments and is one of the key elements in the handful of switch-based puzzles that will briefly befuddle you. Sadly though, the controls are inconsistent, all too often my laser snake took it upon itself to auto-steer – usually when up against bosses that require pinpoint targeting of weak points to destroy – taking me by surprise and thus missing my targets entirely. It’s a frustrating blip in what is an otherwise deeply enjoyable addition.</p>

<p>Sadly, the level design doesn’t live up to the standard of the combat. Bland and empty, running along corridors with some very predictable platforming interspersed, charging through these environments soon gets boring. There’s a light Metroidvania element to proceedings, encouraging you to return to previous levels with newfound abilities to unlock and discover secret areas, but when exploring is this tedious, there’s really little incentive to do so.</p>
<p>More problematically, the controls for Cobra don’t behave whilst he leaps and clambers, all too often missing a handhold that he clearly should have reached and so plunging to his doom. Worse is when the game sticks an enemy on top of a platform that you’re clasping onto. Try and climb up and things get confused, the game not knowing what you want to do, resulting in a stationary Cobra getting shot a lot as you frantically waggle your thumbstick and tap buttons furiously. Perhaps in recognition of these issues, the check point system is very generous, putting you right back into the action with full health and no lives to worry about. Which does undermine the challenge somewhat, that is at least until you run into one of the very unpleasant difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Overall, Space Adventure Cobra is a smooth and accessible experience, putting up just the right amount of resistance to provide a slight challenge, but not much more than that. But then, rather too often, you run into a ridiculously tough mini-boss who will make you cry with despair. These rotters are veritable bullet sponges, and, unlike the main bosses, have no discernible weak points for you to take advantage of and boost your damage.</p>
<p>Each of these irritating foes usually fights you on a locked screen and spews a nasty bullet hell at you, something the game hasn’t bothered in teaching you how to avoid in the proceeding stages, resulting in a lot of frustration as Cobra dies and dies again until you eventually get lucky and can finally proceed. Because of the easy level of challenge elsewhere, these difficulty spikes really stick out, jabbing you right in the unmentionables.</p>
