		<p>The life immersion sim inZOI will be releasing on PS5 in 2026, Krafton has announced. The aim is to get the game out in the first half of 2026 and it could be the target is to launch it a year after early access launched on PC, which was in March this year. Krafton has confirmed the PS5 version will be optimised for consoles and it will have the same features as the PC version.</p>

<p>In addition to the PS5 announcement, Krafton also announced the free Island Getaway DLC, which will add the new location of Cahaya. Cahaya is a location that is based upon South East Asian locations, and it will add new activities such as snorkelling and swimming. There will be two islands to explore in Island Getaway, including a resort island and a main island. Motorcycles and electric scooters will allow players to travel around all locations in the game, and you will also be able to undertake new roles including farming, mining, fishing, and gem crafting. Random gatherings will also take place around the world of inZOI, and there will be new ways to co-operate with other players too. Krafton has also stated that this update will bring limited controller support, which will be in a testing phase.</p>
<p><em>“Cahaya was shaped by feedback from our players, going all the way back to Early Access launch earlier this year,”</em> said Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim, CEO of inZOI Studio and Director of&nbsp;inZOI.<em> “This DLC reflects a vision we’ve built together with our community. Developing a game in a new genre has been a real challenge, but the support we’ve received means everything to us, and we’re just getting started.”</em></p>

<p>The launch of the Island Getaway DLC will coincide with the Mac launch of inZOI on August 20th.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive and SEGA has released a new teaser for Football Manager 26, the next football manager game that will be released after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled earlier this year.</a> This new video gives us a glimpse at some in game footage of the Football Manager 26’s match day experience, including a tease of player walk outs. There is also a focus on the Premier League branding, which has been officially licensed for the new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | GUESS WHO'S BACK | #FM26" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faFwhGRwLCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This has been a very bumpy journey for Sports Interactive and its long running Football Manager series. The cancellation of Football Manager 25 was the first time a game in the series had ever been cancelled, and the main reason for this was the shift from the old engine to Unity to provide a more up to date gameplay experience. Football Manager 25 was meant to incorporate women’s football, but it was going to cut &nbsp;Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It is not yet clear if these modes will be in Football Manager 26.</p>
<p>While there is no release date for Football Manager 26 yet, it would be expected to follow previous games in the series and launch at some point in November, so players can play through the 2025/26 season and beyond. Sports Interactive has stated more information will be coming soon about what to expect in Football Manager 26.</p>
