		<p>During the Dragon Ball 40th anniversary event, Bandai Namco confirmed that Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will be getting new DLC, including new characters, stages, new costumes and new super attacks. All of this is in addition to the free Mission 100 update that will be coming to the game on January 26th, allowing players to use different characters to clear challenges and missions.</p>

<p>The new characters that appear to be confirmed for the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero DLC include Super Android 17, King Piccolo, Super Saiyan Bardock, Spike the Devilman, Grandpa Gohan, Champa, Tao Pai Pai, Zangya and Pikkon. There is also a glimpse at the new costumes for some of the characters and a very brief view of some of the new stages. The DLC will arrive in the Summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with the Switch and Switch 2 releases being staggered for after.</p>

<p>In our Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero review, Jason said, <em>“As a modern successor and sequel to the classic PS2 era Budokai Tenkaichi trilogy, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a great time for Dragon Ball fans. You’ll have to ease yourself into the controls, but once it clicks it’s a lot of fun to explore the full roster and smash anime characters together.”</em></p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced a brand new Dragon Ball game, and it is going to be a completely new entry to the series lore. New Game Project Age 1000 is being created by Akira Toriyama, who is expanding the Dragon Ball universe with new characters and a new world. The teaser trailer shows us who will presumably be the new main protagonist, with this character having the ability to go Super Saiyan.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL | NEW GAME PROJECT &quot;AGE 1000&quot; Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4vLS8HIzs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The unnamed protagonist is part of the Capsule Corp and has the initials GS imprinted on his uniform, which could either be a clue related to his name or a rank of some kind. The trailer shows this character battling in a virtual training room against masked attackers, before a mysterious figure enters the room causing the unknown protagonist to go Super Saiyan. More details are expected at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which is taking place on April 18th and 19th. The Age 1000 game is expected to launch in 2027.</p>
