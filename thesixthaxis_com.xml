		<p>If you’re a returning fan of the series, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4 might make you question the nature of time and mortality. The demo for this remade duology – currently available to those that pre-order the game on PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC – opens with a collection of live footage from the included skaters, that roster including Riley Hawk, Tony Hawk’s adult son, 15 year-old Chloe Cavell, and Olympic star Rayssa Leal, who was born in 2008. For all that this is a remake and remaster of two games from 2001 and 2002, time has definitely passed for Tony Hawk and the skateboarding scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYmlS8zwb5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What it does show is that the skateboarding scene is not just alive and well, it’s kickflipping its way into a whole new generation’s hearts. The easy ability to share clips worldwide, the sport reaching all the way to the Olympics, and the resurgence of games like Skate and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater speaks to a sport that’s in rude health. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is only going to cement that further.</p>


<p>The demo gives you two skaters, Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, though there is a third available if you’ve preordered the Deluxe Edition of the game. That third option is the Slayer from Doom, and maybe it’s just me, but does the Doom guy really seem like the most obvious choice for hitting a wicked Manual and bouncing into a cool kickflip? Weirder tie-ins exist, for sure, but I don’t think it’s the biggest draw for a Deluxe Edition, which also gives you a horrific alien Revenant skater too. If Doom is your favourite franchise, then maybe you’re spending the extra. At least Bam Margera is lurking around the final release.</p>
<p>The demo has two areas, Foundry and College, and it’s little surprise to find that these levels look absolutely stunning on current-gen hardware. Running in 4K, 60fps on PlayStation 5, Foundry has molten metal and jets of steam spilling out into the arena, as well as a focused set of rails, ramps and half-pipes, with the build feeling quite claustrophobic, forcing you to make split-second decisions to keep your combo going.</p>


<p>It’s definitely a more intense option compared to the sprawling College level. Here, those two minutes you’re given feel utterly lacking, as the number of options, hard-to-reach sections and potential routes spiral into the hundreds, if not thousands. It looks stunning, and I loved re-learning the techniques that fans of the series will have embedded in the back of their brain. Rightly or wrongly, grinds and manuals feel more natural now, flowing together more readily than they did when I was younger, but perhaps that’s just the result of familiarity and practice that have been years in the making.</p>
<p>Even in the demo you can dig into your skater’s setup swapping out or adding additional special moves, changing the inputs for these, or altering a few of the cosmetic options, like the board designs. You do earn money through each run, and while there’s no options here to spend it, I’m sure you’ll be buying your favourite skater’s different looks in the full release.</p>
<p>That will undoubtedly play into the upcoming Create-A-Skater mode, so you’ll be able to put yourself (or at least a version of yourself that can ride a skateboard without falling off) into the game. That sits handily alongside the Create-A-Park mode, which lets you create your own park from the ground up. I’m expecting this to run better than ever too, with the current gen horsepower behind them.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s would be nothing without the right soundtrack, and the demo gives you the requisite mix of bands like CKY and Motorhead nuzzling up to Lupe Fiasco for a great mix of vibes while you attempt to land that 900. It’s a real shame to find that some songs from the original games have been cut – an announcement from Alien Ant Farm dropped this week saying they were out – but we won’t know the full track list until we have the final game in our hands. You can remove any songs from the rotation if you don’t like them, and there’s some original tracks from Logan Byers that you can add in as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest surprise about THPS3+4 is that Activision have opted for a mid-range pricepoint of £39.99, which feels like a great price to jump in at, particularly on Switch 2 during its release window. For those on Xbox, it’s also going to be there day one on Game Pass, giving you no reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk’s has never felt smoother, or looked better, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like the perfect way to blend the old-school and the new-school together when it releases for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

		<p>While the paid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">Switch 2 Editions grabbed all the headlines</a> for all the wrong reasons in the run-up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2’s</a> release, it’s fair to say that Nintendo has actually been far more generous through the rest of its game line-up. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/">Free patches for a bunch of games arrived at launch</a> to add key new features and more native Switch 2 support with improved performance across a bunch of first-party games, both big and small, new and old.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Patched Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yyubQ4j5Ngg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start at the top of the alphabet with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>. This spring-loaded fighting game was a fun diversion that arrived in the early days of the original Switch, and since it already performed very nicely on the console, it’s far from the most obvious candidate for a Switch 2 patch.</p>


<p>And yet here it is, and it’s marvellous. Nintendo has bumped up the native resolution to allow for much higher graphical detail to be revealed –&nbsp;you can really see the weave on Min Min’s beanie, for example, and the background audience is so much sharper and well defined –&nbsp;there’s a bit of support for HDR to let colours pop better on modern TV screens and the built-in display… but there’s also one unexpected improvement.</p>
<div id="attachment_461119"><p id="caption-attachment-461119">ARMS now runs at 60fps in 4 player split-screen!</p>
</div>
<p>The single-player game already ran at 60fps on Switch 1, but dropped to 30fps for four-player split-screen –&nbsp;it pulls a trick of updating the left side and right side pairing alternately. Now? Switch 2 has four-player split-screen at a lovely 60fps. It’s sublime. When online is going to rarely have players, local multiplayer is where this game will be at its best now.</p>
<p>Another game with a lovely bump to the resolution and frame rates is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3</a>. Now all areas of the game are running at 60fps, and while battles were already 60fps on Switch 1, that now means that the city plaza hub area has been bumped up from a 30fps limit to 60fps, giving the whole game that same slick smoothness. There’s also been a pretty hefty resolution bump which seems to be to a native 4K during battles, while the plaza does sacrifice some resolution to get its 60fps. Considering that Nintendo has a historical aversion to anti-aliasing, which has continued through to these patches, it’s a major improvement in clarity that does just look great.</p>
<div id="attachment_461120"><p id="caption-attachment-461120">Splatoon 3’s plaza now runs at 60fps on Switch 2 and resolutions have been greatly increased.</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/09/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review/">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a> is an example that’s just… well, it’s fine. The game has optimised visuals, and there is a jump in resolution, but given the art style, the difference feels minimal. The game was originally a Wii U title, and alongside Captain Toad and Mario 3D World (two games we’ve not tested), Nintendo’s restraint for the original platform already meant that these games look, run and play incredibly well in their original Switch ports. I don’t have Bowser’s Fury, but I understand that this had some performance issues on Switch that Switch 2 has resolved.</p>
<div id="attachment_461121"><p id="caption-attachment-461121">NSMBU on Switch 2 is higher res, but the difference feels minimal.</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is another game that already looked pretty fantastic and Nintendo again did a marvellous job optimising the title to perform consistently well. Yet, there were some Kingdoms that really pushed the console rather hard. New Donk City is an obvious example that really suffered from a lowered resolution, dropping from the 900p docked target to 720p to handle this and maintain the all-important 60fps. With no anti-aliasing it made for a really very shimmery image when running around. The Switch 2 update makes this just so much clearer pushing up to around 1700p in New Donk City, around 5x the number of pixels, and capable of higher in less taxing kingdoms and areas. There is still some aliasing shimmer when getting around quickly, but it feels so much better and clearer.</p>
<div id="attachment_461122"><p id="caption-attachment-461122">Switch 2 can power Mario Odyssey’s New Donk City to much higher resolutions.</p></div>
<p>The two chibi-like Zelda games for Switch – that’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a> and Echoes of Wisdom – have also been patched. Though unfortunately we see some mixed results. The game resolution has been bumped up massively, which is lovely, but in docked play, the push for 4K gives Ukuku Prarie, Mabe Village, the beach a drop away from that 60fps target. We’re not sure what’s going on here, because we then compared the swamp area that troubled the Switch 1, and this is now just 60fps on Switch 2. It is… strange, and I double checked to be sure. Thankfully, this seems to disappear when playing in handheld, as the maximum resolution comes down to 1080p.</p>
<div id="attachment_461123"><p id="caption-attachment-461123">Link’s Awakening seems less capable of holding 60fps on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>By contrast, a little route we ran in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">Echoes of Wisdom</a> showed great improvement. We could easily drop the frame rate to a V-Sync 30fps through setting lots of fires, summoning lots of creatures, and the like, and this has just been stamped out with a close to locked 60fps.</p>
<div id="attachment_461124"><p id="caption-attachment-461124">Echoes of Wisdom is a clear win on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>Across a bunch of games where there was co-op previously, there’s now support for GameShare, which streams the game to local and online co-op buddies, and can pull some fantastic tricks to give independent views in games that need it. It works really quite well, though the streams can be a bit compressed and poor WiFi can be an impediment. We tried it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">51 Worldwide Games</a>, but there’s also Big Brain Academy, through to Mario Odyssey, Mario 3D World and Captain Toad. It’s great to see it added, but some of these games also show the restricted access that GameShare is given, being limited to certain games and modes instead of being more freeform like Sony and Valve’s equivalents.</p>
<p>But then we come to the game that is most thoroughly transformed by the Switch 2 patch: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. This game remains in a quite shockingly poor state on original Switch, a real indictment for the work by Game Freak on the series of late, with mediocre visual targets, poor resolutions and strange compromises, all combined with seriously poor performance that’s not befitting of even the underpowered original Switch hardware.</p>

<p>Switch 2 just blasts through all of that, delivering a quite gorgeous looking game that runs at 60fps instead of a poorly paced 30fps…. at best on Switch 1. It looks very clean and crisp on Switch 2, but also seems to be using DLSS upscaling from 1080p when docked to reach that goal – you can see the true resolution after a camera cut, before the temporal anti-aliasing can use that to spruce up following frames. There’s further improvements, so background elements that were at cut frame rates now run smoothly at much greater distances, there’s more Pokémon out and about, and this is generally a huge improvement…. but it’s still well below what the such a huge franchise as Pokémon deserves, there’s still a lot of pop-in, and the base level of the graphics should be much better. Hopefully <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> takes a step forward.</p>
<p>We looked at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">general backward compatibility last week</a>, and saw some great improvements to steady frame rates and lift dynamic resolutions, but with a dedicated patch, games can clearly go an awful lot further. Honestly, the only games that Nintendo updated that really <em>needed</em> an update for performance here were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and perhaps Echoes of Wisdom and Link’s Awakening, but Nintendo has shown great value in patching other games from their back catalogue, even ports from the Wii U, boosting resolutions, frame rates in specific modes, and of course, adding GameShare support. It’s great to have these patches across the board, and hope to see many more examples of this, where possible.</p>
