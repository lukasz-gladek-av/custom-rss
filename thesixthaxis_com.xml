		<p>Clifftop Games and RawFury have announced that Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer will launch on 20th May for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kathy Rain 2 | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psjR0wSmVEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in 1998 in the metropolitan city of Kassidy, this point and click adventure sequel sees Kathy pursuing the serial killer known as the Soothsayer. Players will lead kathy through the world, picking up on clues, grabbing evidence and eventually confronting the serial killer themselves.</p>
<p>We’re almost a decade on from the original Kathy Rain game, and five years from the Director’s Cut reimagining, and so while the game still has a retro pixel art style, it looks like there’s been a pretty big step forward in how refined that pixel art look is. There’s now modern features like dynamic lighting and surface reflections. These go hand-in-hand with hand-drawn cutscenes and portrait, while Arielle Siegel will reprise her role as Kathy alongside some other returning voice artists.</p>
