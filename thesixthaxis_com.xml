		<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket is getting a brand new expansion on December 17th, and it is called Mythical Island. The major addition is a brand new booster pack that will add 80 new cards to the game, including new trainers, new EX cards, and new immersive cards. The trailer for the Mythical Island pack shows those cards and some of their abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island  | Coming Soon!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUYHC2ReohA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mew is the cover Pokemon for this pack, and there will be a Mew EX card. This card has Psyshot as the basic attack, and Genome Hacking will allows Mew to use the attack of the opponent’s active Pokemon. There is also going to be an Aerodactyl Ex which has an ability to prevent opponents evolving their cards. It also has an 80 damage land crush attack. Some new cards that are spotted in the trailer include a Vaporeon art card, a Dedenne art card, Marshadow art card, Dhelmise, Morelull, a new Magmar,&nbsp; a new Tauros card, a new Exeggute card, and new trainer Blue that reduces incoming damage by 10 points.</p>
<p>There will be a lot more cards, so it is best to start saving up those hourglasses to tear open a whole load of packs in one go. Last month, the development team confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/pokemon-pocket-update-new-booster-packs-limited-trading-january/">new booster packs soon would be coming soon, and limited trading would arrive in January</a>. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>
