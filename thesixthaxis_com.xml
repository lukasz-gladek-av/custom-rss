		<p>Commandos: Origins is now set to be released in March 2025, Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media have announced. The reason for Commandos: Origins getting a new release window is to allow the development team more time. The studio is working on feedback from those who played both the game’s demo and those who took part in the closed beta.</p>

<p>“<em>The Commandos franchise has always been rooted in tactical precision; offering different approaches to solve versatile missions. The teams at Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media are fully committed to honoring this legacy. With the valuable feedback we have collected from our devoted community, we’re now making the final adjustments needed to deliver the best possible tactical experience for our players</em>” said Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios.</p>
<p>The updates that Claymore Game Studios will be working on addressing the feedback that Commandos: Origins felt clunky, so optimisation is key. The enemy AI will also be looked at to make them react better to player actions. The voice work is also be re-recorded with the final release featuring &nbsp;English, German, French, Spanish, and Chinese voices. The voice work that was in the demo and beta was temporary, according to the studio. At release there will be three different control schemes, and custom keybinding will be available on PC. The loot system is also being reworked where some enemies will drop loot, and other loot can be found in buildings. This loot will then be usable by the Commando that collected it as part of their abilities, without having to deal with an inventory. Non-lethal combat options are also going to made available at the game’s launch, along with more hints and tooltips.</p>

<p>Commandos: Origins will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, as well as being on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>
