<p>Written and directed by Jones – best known for Moon, Source Code, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/26/is-warcraft-the-videogame-movie-weve-all-been-waiting-for/">Warcraft</a> and Mute – Rogue Trooper adapts the cult 2000AD comic book for the big screen, a story that was previously adapted to video games in the mid-noughties (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/rogue-trooper-redux-review/">remastered in 2017</a>). The film stars Aneurin Barnard (The Goldfinch, Dunkirk) as the Rogue Trooper, and Jemaine Clement (Avatar 2: The Way of Water) and Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows) as battleground looters Mr Brass and Mr Bland.</p>

<p>They’ve all donned full motion capture suits for the movie, which is fully CGI, similar to Jones’ Warcraft movie, or the predominantly CG Avatar films. Filming was completed last year using head mounted cameras for performance capture, while imagery and animation partner Treehouse Digital has been feeding all of that into Unreal Engine 5, before Liberty Films then add their own VFX and animation on top.</p>

<p>The other still shots give a look at a huge war vehicle on Nu Earth, which is the location of the battle between the Norts and Southers, and we get to see some Souther soldiers who are lost in the toxic wasteland of battle.</p>

<p>Producer Stuart Fenegan said, “We are so excited to share a first look of the film and show the amazing fidelity with which the team have used our actors on set performances to drive the animated characters. That level of detail and nuance was a priority from day one.”</p>
<p>Duncan Jones, meanwhile, had this to say: “AHHHHHHHHHHHH! WE’RE ALMOST FINISHED! SEE YOU AT SDCC!!”</p>
<p>He’s going to be at San Diego Comic Con on 25th July for a fan meeting and signing of the Rogue Trooper hero image.</p>
