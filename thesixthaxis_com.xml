		<p>While ZA/UM is now a very different studio to the one that made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>, the team that now exists at the studio has revealed Zero Parades, an intriguing spy thriller CRPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="ZERO PARADES - Official Announcement Trailer (Gamescom 2025) #gamescom2025 #gaming #pcgaming" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4JVY8rR-XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re one of the best spies out there, Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, but you’re one that’s haunted by past failures and seek redemption by taking on a new and mysterious assignment. That drops you into a three-way power struggle for control of a new city, going up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, and plenty more.</p>
<p>You’ll fail in your mission, but then you’ll have another chance to right this wrong.</p>
<p>Here’s some Steam blurb:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong>: Play as Hershel – brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to shit. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li>
<li><strong>Espionage Reinvented:</strong> Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour – no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li>
<li><strong>Failing Forward:</strong> In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li>
<li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG: </strong>From the studio which brought you <i>Disco Elysium. </i>Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li>
<li><strong>A Question of Identity: </strong>Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment. Cope with the terror of reality by giving up parts of yourself and try not to lose your mind in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally released for PC in 2019, Disco Elysium was enhanced and came to consoles in 2021, and a stunning example of narratives within video games. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/14/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-review-ps5-ps4-stadia-pc/">10/10 review of Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</a>, Gamoc said, “The story is absolutely captivating, the world is filled to the brim with detail, and the characters and their motivations are remarkably well thought out. […] Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a masterwork and you are doing yourself a disservice if you miss it.”</p>

		<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> – Order of the Giants DLC <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-coming-out-in-september/">set to launch next month</a>, Bethesda and MachineGames shared a new gameplay and story trailer to dive into what it will entail when it arrives on 4th September.</p>
<p>Oh, and the game is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026! Surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The DLC takes us back to Italy, and Rome in particular, to delve into some of the mysteries surrounding the Order of the Giants, starting with a huge helmet that the pope had, and continuing on to translate some ancient messages, suggesting that the mythical giants never died… if they were ever alive?</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now across Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5.In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review of the main game</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

		<p>Capcom shared a new trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, the revival of this classic Japanese action series, set to launch in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 3rd Trailer: The Genma Experiments" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXkU_TOx3sE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showcases more of the enemies that you’ll face in Onimusha: Way of the Sword, with Miyamoto Musashi tormented verbally by a mysterious foe as she unleashes new and different enemies at him, including some creepy ones that can stand up again after being totally cut in half. </p>
<p>Thankfully Musashi is one heck of a samurai warrior, Oni Gauntlet on his arm or no, and fights back with incredible flourishes of his sword, multi-blade attacks and more as he delves into the malice and Genma monstrosities that afflict the city of Kyoto.</p>

		<p>TT Games and Warner Bros. have revealed their next big LEGO game – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC!</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the definitive, essential Batman story, going from origin to legend. Train with the League of Shadows, fight crime in Gotham, face off against the Joker, Penguin, Bane (voiced by Matt Berry!) and plenty more, referencing TV, comics, movies and games, all mushed together in the TT Games way. This latest Lego game looks to build on the legacy of both the previous Lego Batman games and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The combat features powerful attacks, counters, combos in more of an Arkham Asylum way.&nbsp;This game will have difficulty levels for the first time – Dark Knight mode will ramp things up – and you will build a family of Bat-allies.</p>
<p>Oh, and Gotham is a big open world as well to explore how you see fit.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, we said “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious Lego game yet, and despite the occasional technical mishap it delivers a daring and often delightful romp through the most iconic film franchise of all time.”</p>

		<p>Long-awaited sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a> now has a launch window, and is set to launch in late 2025 for Xbox and Steam, and it will be day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH5ZYM3nCP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong> – Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay </strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong> – The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown </strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. Before a brief check in back in July, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">the previous update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>
