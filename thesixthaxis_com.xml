			<p>It’s hard out here for a <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>fan, guys. Every year for what’s felt like a decade, a new game comes out that is tangentially related to this franchise, but never actually a proper sequel or continuation. There’s a lot to love about these anime girl proxies for video game consoles, but they’ve been stuck in a non-canonical limbo for far too long. At some points, this has produced gold – like when one of these spin-offs introduced an anime girl based on the <em>idea </em>of Touhou, or when another was secretly a tightly-crafted character-action crossover with my other favorite niche Japanese game series <em>Senran Kagura. </em>Unfortunately, far more often these <em>Neptunia </em>diversions end up being poorly polished and instantly forgettable. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>falls hard into that category.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos | Announcement Trailer | Steam®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6K3hDTtHNX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First of all, don’t even look in the direction of this game if you aren’t already familiar with the <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>series. The game throws you into Uzume and the Gamindustri Goddesses’ latest dilemma so swiftly that it feels more like a side-quest from a different game than its own standalone product.</p>


<p>Due to hastily explained shenanigans, hordes of jelly-shaped pup creatures called Dogoos are invading the realm, so our heroes hop onto some anime-as-hell motorcycles to round ’em all up before it’s too late. Every character, as usual, is incredibly silly and funny and charming. I’m sure if you hop into this blind you’ll get some joy out of Izumi’s straight-man act or Nep-nep’s almost Deadpool-level meta shenanigans. If the game were really fun, the context for these characters and their quest wouldn’t even matter.</p>


<p>That fun, however, is few and far between. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>consists of five stages, each containing three levels that repeatedly task you with collecting every Dogoo you see – a mission that will take you barely two minutes to complete. In between the missions and the cutscene chatter, you can buy costume accessories and motorcycle upgrades, but it all feels so tepid when the actual gameplay is so short, so basic, and so repetitive.</p>
<p>There’s almost an arena car action angle to this game, but the lack of any mechanical depth or lengthier stages makes everything feel like the tutorial for a bigger game, or a mini-game you’d play in the latest Hoyoverse gacha game to earn some extra gems. The Dogoo collecting is just <em>okay. </em>Your motorcycle handles fine, and the game tries to spice things up by tossing different stage layouts at you and sprinkling a few Mario Kart-style debuff items in your way. Those short levels make it impossible for you to spend enough time in a stage for any of this to click or matter, though.</p>

<p>What hurts is that I don’t hate the idea of a motorcycle-focused Neptunia spinoff at all. If this had been more of a racing game, or a proper car-combat game, or even <em>Rocket League </em>with the cars swapped for motorcycles and the soccer balls swapped for Dogoos, I feel like it’d be golden. What’s here now is so barebones and basic, though, and you’ll have it all wrapped up in barely a couple of hours.</p>
<p>These <em>Neptunia side games</em> have established a pattern of moving on and re-doing everything from scratch in a whole new genre instead of ever building on what the previous game did. If they bucked that trend now, a follow-up to this game could be something special. There’s something here that die-hard fans might appreciate as it is now, but it’s so brief and half-baked. Plus, with how long it’s been since a meaningful entry in this series, I have a hard time believing there are very many die-hard fans left.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos is not the follow-up that Hyperdimension Neptunia fans want or deserve. There are specks of charm and fun to be had here, but you'll have to dig deep, and after just two or three hours of digging, it'll all be over.	</p></div>

		<p>Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios are arguably the masters of co-op action, and their latest, Split Fiction, is looking like something pretty special. Excitingly, we’re now barely six weeks away from its launch, and just to make sure we keep up that level of excitement, the team have dropped a brand new trailer, showing off more of the co-op action, and some of the extremely varied gameplay styles we’re going to get to enjoy together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game centres on Mio and Zoe – named for Fares’ daughters – each of which are authors of different genres of fiction. Drawn into their own works, the levels and overarching story are half science fiction and half fantasy, making this an exciting amalgam of the two.</p>
<p>This latest trailer shows off more of the levels, with the first centring on gravity, set within a futuristic cyberpunk city. There’s giant mechs to fight, and some cool gravity tethering action here, as well as some Ghostrunner-esque motorbike sections that look absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>Next up, we get to see a fantasy level, with the two characters gaining the ability to shapeshift into different creatures, becoming a huge ape-like monster, or a fast-moving water-dweller, while you collaborate to make it to the end of the level. If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> you’ll have an understanding of the wild and varied types of gameplay we’re likely to come across, and this only cements our excitement. It’s little surprise that the game made it into the top ten of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Most Wanted for 2025</a>.</p>

<p>As the trailer closes out, Fares shows off some of the additional content that’s going to be available here, with side quest portals opening up at various points to take you into a new world, with another new gameplay style. While you won’t have to play these to advance the story, it looks like you won’t want to miss out on it.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will launch on March 6, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app. Players can also invite a friend to play with them for free on any platform (Crossplay on PS, Xbox &amp; PC) with the Friend’s Pass.</p>
