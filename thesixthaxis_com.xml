		<p>Announced during the inaugural Galaxies Showcase, VOID Interactive has confirmed that their tactical FPS Ready or Note is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the fictional city of Los Sueños, a surge of crime across the city has led to the LSPD leaning more and more heavily on its SWAT teams to respond to everything from active bomb threats to suspects that have barricaded themselves in and hostage situations. Throughout the game, you need to employ authentic SWAT tactics, making use of equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field, and with player customisation including armour, weapons, apparel and more.</p>
<p>At launch on console, Ready or Not will feature all the previous content released for PC, as well as some brand new levels in the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update that is launching alongside the console version. This means that the game will have 20 missions that can be played solo or with online co-op for up to five players – and with full cross-play, you can join up with PC players as well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Deluxe Edition will also bundle in the additional DLC season pass, with six levels already released in the Home Invasion DLC and Dark Waters DLC, and an unannounced DLC 3 also coming.</p>

<p>Ready or Not will sell for $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 with the base game, while a Day One Edition will bundle in an M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol and 590M Shotgun (these will be added free for PC owners of the game). The Deluxe Edition is $69.99 / £59.99 / €69.99/ £59.99, including the DLC pass and pre-order bonuses.</p>
<p>Seen as a spiritual success to the classic SWAT series, Ready or Not has been a big hit on PC, having first gone through Steam Early Access in 2021 and leading up to its full release in 2023. That hasn’t been without controversy, in part to the depiction of scenarios where you can easily draw parallels to real world events. This is always a difficult line that tactical shooter developers have to toe, though it’s worth noting that you are unambiguously playing as the good guys when compared to, say, the wanton, cartoonish violence of the Payday series, where your player criminals get barely a slap on the wrist for killing bystanders.</p>
