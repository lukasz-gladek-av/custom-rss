		<p>While there are plenty of game series plastered over perfumes, candles or food, sometimes collaborations actually make a good deal of sense, companies joining forces to make something that serves them both. Chinese electronics manufacturer <a href="https://uk.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-uk-collab-event">UGREEN</a> have done exactly that, teaming up with <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/">Genshin Impact</a> in order to deliver a batch of phone accessories that are designed to keep you playing for a very, very long time. They’ve also been thoroughly Genshined. Or is that Impacted?</p>

<p>Our press reveal for this kit came in a very large box, with everything nestling inside matching the green and black livery of the Kinich-inspired Genshin theme. The three bits of tech inside are all available separately or in this Limited Edition gift box form – <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-kinich-series">which you can win</a> – where UGREEN have pulled them together, so, you’re getting a 65W GaN fast charger ($27.99), a 20,000mAh Nexode quick charge power bank ($69.99) and a 15W Qi2 wireless charger ($41.99), all wrapped up with a suitably lurid 100W-certified USB-C cable.</p>


<p>The 20,000mAh power bank is more like a power brick, housing four 5000mAh batteries in series. It’s the most insane charging bank I’ve ever personally come across, not just thanks to the excellent Genshin Impact livery, but because it also houses a full-colour TFT screen. This tells you exactly what it’s doing, so alongside letting you know when it’s charging, it can tell you how much juice it’s pumping out of the three ports in its rear. And that can be seriously impressive got a 100W USB-C outlet, a standard 30W USB-C one, and a 22.5W USB-A port as well. While it’s all very interesting – I could watch numbers go up and down all day – I wasn’t able to realise the 100W experience, topping out at 18.9W over USB-C.</p>


<p>Whatever the reality of it charging my fast-charge approved Honor Magic V3, it was very fast, taking my phone from 40% to 100% in 30 minutes, while using up around 20% of its own charge. You can plug three devices in at the same time, and here the Nexode Power Bank can reach a maximum output of 130W, letting you charge your phone, your laptop and your headphones at the same time. It’s been a perfect companion when I’ve been travelling recently, letting me game on my phone without any worries of my boarding ticket not working when I reach the gate.</p>
<p>When it’s not showing you charging data, the power bank shows cheerful little animations of itself wearing headphones, which is cute. Beyond the three ports and the screen, the sole other interface is the control button which wakes it up, and lets you cycle through a little more power bank data, if you need some graphs with your numbers. In a further nod to its Genshin Impact-approved status, you also get little pixel-art animations of Ajaw too which should delight fans.</p>

<p>In terms of outputs, it’s a similar story with the 65W 3-port charger. You’ve got three ports here with the two USB-C sockets for most modern tech, and a USB-A port for older bits and bobs. The two USB-C ports can max out at 65W individually, auto-negotiating to whatever your device can handle, or will split down to 45W and 20W if both are used together. The USB-A port tops out at 22.5W, and if you’re using everything, then the ports drop to 45W, 8.5W and 8.5W. That’s a little short of the brick’s maximum, but will still be more than capable of charging all your kit up overnight.</p>
<p>The final component in the gift set is the 15W Magflow Wireless Charger which folds out to give you adjustable viewing. It’s a Qi2 charger and MagSafe certified to give the fastest wireless charging for the latest phones, while using the wizardry of magnets to keep everything locked in place, regardless of how you angle the top mount – very handy if you want to watch something while falling asleep! Lifting that up also exposes a dinky little nook at the bottom that can charger up some AirPods at 5W, and there’s a 5W USB-C passthrough on the side that’s meant for charging an Apple Watch, but can really be used for any low-power USB-C charging.</p>

<p>All these items feel utterly rock solid, and boast some serious manufacturing expertise. It feels as though you’ll have to put them through some serious punishment to scratch or damage the Genshin Impact imagery too, so they should stay looking as luminous and unique as they do when you take them out of the box.</p>
<p>UGREEN have put together a really cool batch of Genshin Impact-inspired devices, and if you’re a fan of the game who’s in need of some extra juice to keep those pulls going, this is the perfect collaboration for you. Of course, they’re all just branded versions of UGREEN’s graphite grey gear, in case you want more subtle looking charging tech instead.</p>
