		<p>Full Circle and EA have shared the world map for their upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate">Skate</a> revival, diving into the city of San Vansterdam with the latest dev diary update.</p>
<p>The team are building up to playtests for those who signed up for Insider access, with anyone that RSVP’d before 27th June guaranteed to be invited at some point. Once you’re in the play ground, you’ll retain access through to the Early Access launch. Three weekly waves have already gone out with one more on the 22nd July. After that, they’ll keep adding people day-by-day until all RSVP’d players are invited.</p>


<p>Part of the latest testing update – they’re up to version 0.27, which people are already hand on with – is the reveal of San Vansterdam’s world map with four neighbourhoods to skate through in Hedgemont, Gullcrest,&nbsp; Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>Hedgemont is where players will start off, getting introduced to challenges and missions in the skatepark under the bridge, along the waterfront and more. Once you’ve completed enough stuff, take the Skateway elevated path to Gullcrest Village. The centrepieces here are the House of the Rolling Reverence church which has been converted for skating, and there’s a car park right next door as well.&nbsp;Market Mile then has a bunch of tall buildings and elevated walkways to explore, and Brickswich bring a big sports stadium with the exterior surrounded by skate ramps and smooth lines.</p>
