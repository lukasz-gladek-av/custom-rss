		<p>It’s been a lovely week here at TSA, and as we’ve counted down our most-wanted games through the start of the year, we’ve been playing a bunch of things in the here and now. I’ve been having a great time, checking out the ports for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/dynasty-warriors-origins-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2, while also jumping back and forth through Frontiers of Pandora and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines: Arise</a>. I also took a lovely couple of hours out playing Is This Seat Taken with my youngest son, so all in all, it’s been a good gaming week!</p>

<p>First to pop their head up, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played more Ghost of Yotei, which he seems to be getting towards the end of, as well as some more Borderlands 4, and he’s made it fifteen hours deep into Core Keeper, which he says, “I kinda love it!” Last by hopefully not least, he’s made a start on Cairn for our upcoming review.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has played a fair amount of Darktide this week, saying, “I’m really starting to gel with it, perhaps even more so than Vermintide 2. Playing as the Arbites is still fun and I’m at the stage where levelling up and assigning points is starting to get rewarding, allowing me to hone a certain playstyle. In search of an easy game to play with my daughter (after watching her play Paw Patrol Grand Prix on autopilot for several hours) we landed on LocoRoco Remastered which has been a wholesome trip down memory lane.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> is struggling to settle on a game at the moment, so he has picked up a Retroid Pocket 5 and has been spending time getting that set up and testing different formats, rather than committing to anything. He’s also got a secret preview game to check out this weekend but is “mostly kicking my heels until Resident Evil 9. I’ve tried a few horror demos as per usual and added more to my overwhelming wishlist!”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> kept things simple this week, as he’s working on our review of MIO: Memories in Orbit, and Jason kept things even more simple, by playing nothing except Dunecrawl. He says, “I am simply floating between games, aimlessly, hopelessly, waiting for my D&amp;D group to sort themselves out so I can roll some dice and do silly voices.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> teamed up with her old pal Indy – I thought this was going to be Ade? – this week to finally play the Order of the Giants DLC. She told us, “It’s been great getting back to whip swinging, subterranean tomb exploring and bad-guy punching. Oh except for the bit where Indy had to swim absolutely everywhere and it was taking an age… then once I’d completed the area and returned to the start point, I realised I could’ve taken the boat! Doh!”</p>

<p>Speaking of <strong>Ade</strong>, he’s spent this week playing ‘waiting for Season 6 of Marvel Rivals’ but he’s just finished; it’s out today! His neighbours should probably expect all sorts of Deadpool shenanigans.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun the last touches of room decoration, but has been drawn back to Animal Crossing: New Horizons with its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and new hotel to decorate. Sounds like’s taking a bit of a busman’s holiday there!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

			<p>The Musou games and their ‘1v1000’ gameplay style are practically a foundational piece for video game civilisation at this point. Ever since the original Dynasty Warriors game appeared on the PlayStation, they’ve pushed the technical boundaries of each platform, filling your screens with Yellow Turban Warriors, four-digit kill counts, and screen-filling carnage at every turn. Now it’s the turn of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is not the first Musou game to arrive on this generation of handheld.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBwUY3uPrU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have worked alongside Nintendo for a considerable length of time, with their collaboration on the Legend of Zelda spin-off Hyrule Warriors ensuring that this is a team that are thoroughly versed in Nintendo’s hardware. Most recently, that’s seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> arrive on Switch 2, and it’s clear that many of the lessons learned from that release have been carried over to this port of Dynasty Warriors Origins.</p>


<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins immediately impresses with the quality of its cutscenes. Fully voiced in either Japanese or English, these look excellent, whether CG or in-engine, and they run at a consistent frame rate as well, which you can’t always guarantee on Nintendo’s less powerful hardware. The in-engine versions give you a good look at the character models, and they’re surprisingly close to those you’ll see on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Series X</a>, albeit with a hint more anti-aliasing shimmer around character’s hair. They set the tone for an experience that feels very close to the one available across other platforms.</p>


<p>Omega Force look to have made smart decisions with the transition to Switch 2, rather than just a wholesale downgrade which seems to be the current approach for a number of companies. That, in and of itself, makes this one of the most consistent and impressive Switch 2 ports we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>There’s two key graphical settings here, and it’s nice to see Koei Tecmo letting Switch 2 players make some decisions about the game’s visual setup. In this case, that means opting for either a locked 30fps or letting Origins run with an unlocked, variable frame rate, and it’s an intriguing choice.</p>
<p>There is certainly some extra fluidity when playing with a variable frame rate, and that wiggle room means that, at times, Dynasty Warriors: Origins can feel more reactive. However, that also means that the frame rate can alter depending on the situation, and with more warriors on screen, there’s definitely increased stress and strain on the engine. The frame rate doesn’t drop to a point where it feels like stuttering, but if you’re aware of it, you’ll probably want to opt for the locked 30fps, as it’s simply more consistent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the place where it feels like the most graphical concessions have been made is in the open world. This top-down overworld has definitely lost some detail, and you can make the frame rate occasionally drop when you’re running around and spinning the camera about. Still, as a slower, non-action section of the game, it doesn’t detract from the experience at all. This is all true whether in docked or handheld mode, but, unusually, the handheld mode actually feels more detailed, particularly in cutscenes and the open world. There’s none of the obvious resolution downgrading that I’m used to seeing, and it makes Origins an excellent experience when you’re out and about.</p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins served as a reset for the series, and it managed to update and revise the classic Musou experience for the modern day, tightening up the combat and beefing up the storytelling while layering RPG-like progression across the top of it. All of that feels just as good here in the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>The question mark that lingers over Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the addition of a fictional central character, complete with amnesia, a mystical quest, and a newfound supernatural element. For a series that remains grounded in history – albeit a hyper-stylised, caricature of this period of Chinese history – it was an interesting pivot, but one that fits with the shift in tone towards an action-RPG. If anything, I found it gave me more agency and more permanence than previous Dynasty Warriors games, giving me a place within the narrative and setting that matched my own, external viewpoint.</p>
<p>Alongside the more in-depth combat and RPG-like progression, Dynasty Warriors: Origins stand out feature is its audio. The quality of both the English and the Japanese dub is good, but it’s the orchestral soundtrack with its louder, more bombastic moments during battles that really help to set the tone for a journey that feels as grand and epic as you could hope for.</p>
