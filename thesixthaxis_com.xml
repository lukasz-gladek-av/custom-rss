		<p>Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertianment, has stepped down with immediate effect, in mutual agreement with the company’s Board of Directors. Markus Mäki, one of the studio’s founders and Chairman of the Board up until this point, is shifting across to be interim CEO, and Board member Henri Österlund is stepping up to be the new Chairman.</p>
<p>Remedy’s interim CEO Markus Mäki said, “I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.”</p>


<p>The change of leadership comes a few weeks after <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy revised their financial outlook</a>, off the back of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak’s</a> underperformance. Having launched in June, the game immediately struggled, with Remedy working to bring major overhauls to their first live service title. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/30/fbc-firebreak-drops-its-first-major-update-today-bringing-new-missions-enemies-and-mods-to-the-game/">This launched on 29th September</a>, but despite bringing “improved player and sales metrics after the update, sales have not reached Remedy’s internal targets.”&nbsp;This leaves the company with “a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to FBC: Firebreak.”</p>
<p>A Q3 2025 business review will come on 29h October to provide a broader picture of the studio’s development efforts and future outlook.</p>
<p>Remedy enjoyed many highs through Virtala’s tenure as CEO, who joined the company just as they were looking for new independence and impetus after a long period of working exclusively with Microsoft. That included a first IPO to secure funding to grow into a multi-game studio, &nbsp;and to partnerships with 505 Games and Smilegate in the early years. This, in turn, produced the major hit for the company that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a> (and the easily forgotten dud that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crossfirex">CrossfireX</a>), and the company rode that momentum to gain new partnerships and investment. A significant deal with Epic Games brought the Alan Wake Remastered and a slick and very well received horror sequel in Alan Wake 2. They’ve also secured funding for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2,</a> and bought back rights to go it alone.</p>

<p>In the name of diversifying their portfolio, Remedy ventured into multiplayer gaming with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, but the game has underperformed, and alongside slower sales for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/26/alan-wake-2-review/">Alan Wake 2</a> that outside observers might have expected, put a bit of a dent into their status on the stock market. Since nearly hitting share prices of €50 in 2021, they’ve slid back down to around €13.</p>
<p>To be clear, Remedy’s new outlook is that revenue will still increase over last year, but that operating profit from ongoing development projects will be negative. The push is now to forge ahead with work on the Max Payne remakes and Control 2, with more details on these to come at next week’s business review.</p>

			<p>Back in the ancient past of the late 20th century there was a real push towards games emulating animated films. While this was generally more a matter of marketing spiel than anything substantial, the true pioneer of this approach was the classic (albeit terrible) Dragon’s Lair, a game which used the beautiful animation of Don Bluth to stitch together gameplay that was more akin to a lengthy QTE than anything else. The timeless nature of this approach means that the original game still holds up visually to this day. Modern gaming has taken a turn towards hyper-realism with the increase in processing power, so Bye Sweet Carole stands out as much as Dragon’s Lair did, for different reasons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bye Sweet Carole - Launch Trailer | Available Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CsIxYSRkfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can’t discuss Bye Sweet Carole without beginning with the aesthetics. The animated style – far more reminiscent to me of Don Bluth than the comparisons to Disney that are being thrown around – is stunning and gives the game a truly unique character which feels deliberately at odds with the darker and more sinister aspects of the game. Characters and backgrounds are memorable and distinctive, whilst enemies flow in a creepy and sludgy way. The level of detail is admirable and the relatively compact world becomes easy to navigate and explore.</p>


<p>Music and voice acting are also strong here, with a fully voiced script and music that is both atmospheric and emotional, perfectly fitting the game’s touching narrative. While you can skip the dialogue (useful for when you have to rewatch scenes after deaths) it is well worth letting them play out the first time – there’s even an achievement for doing so.</p>


<p>The story of Bye Sweet Carole feels like a true coming of age (or bildungsroman as we call it in the literary trade). The titular Carole is absent from the game, with the plot revolving around her best friend, Lana, attempting to discover how she disappeared, and eventually coming to terms with life without her. This is an emotional story of friendship, grief, and loss that is made even more interesting by being wrapped up in the context of the early 20th century suffragette movement. The shifts in expectations and hopes for young women during this time provide a crucial backdrop to the events.</p>
<p>So far, so glowingly positive, and I would definitely recommend playing Bye Sweet Carole for all the experiences described above but the gameplay is a bit more of a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The ‘survival horror’ tag applied Bye Sweet Carole is somewhat misleading, as what we have is more of a classic point and click adventure game mixed with some underwhelming platforming and stealth horror sections. The adventure side of things is well designed and features some really nice puzzles that offer enough challenge to keep your interest without becoming frustrating. The exception to this is a late game puzzle involving time travel and growing a seed, where the dialog prompts led me to believe that the game had broken – a sentiment shared by many in the Steam forums. You’ll spend the game exploring the interior and surroundings of Bunny Hall looking for keys, switching levers and using your ability to change into a rabbit to navigate tight spaces. Progression is well paced and this part of the game remains enjoyable throughout.</p>
<p>Where the game falls down, however, is in the platforming and stealth parts. Lana feels quite stiff to control and it is very easy to slip from a platform and die. Her rabbit form is far more nimble, though, and to be honest I switched to it whenever I was able to. Then there are numerous ledges that require you to balance using the left stick that go on for too long, whilst instadeath stealth sections often feel more random than designed. The latter are very common, although many can be avoided by simply running away. You can hide in lockers and hold the left trigger to hold your breath, but this mechanic is never particularly engaging and feels tacked on.</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me, however, was the enforced stealth sections that reminded me of Dragon’s Lair for all the wrong reasons, as they felt arbitrary as to whether you would be spotted or not. These were generally being preceded by unskippable cutscenes, which made me resent them even more. I think the idea of blending adventure and action is an interesting one, but the balance here is just off.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Bye Sweet Carole is a curate’s egg of a game, with the presentation being truly superb and the storytelling excellent, but the bulk of the game experience just isn’t fun. The frustrating platforming and stealth, combined with the review build being quite buggy, led to me finishing the game with gritted teeth rather than enjoyment. The bugs can be fixed (and the devs are working on patches) but the imbalance between the two gameplay styles is a more fundamental issue. If you can see past this then the game has a lot to offer in terms of aesthetic and story but, ironically, these can be enjoyed through watching a playthrough without subjecting yourself to the frustration.	</p></div>

		<p>Netmarble has announced a slight delay to the release of Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive, pushing back launch from November 17th by a week. The reason given is that the team needs a bit more time to get Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive to address issues and get the game up to scratch. However, the delay is not that long with the new official date set as November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team said, <em>“Thanks to the valuable feedback Hunters shared across various channels during the first demo period, the development of Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE has been progressing smoothly. However, we kindly ask for your understanding as the official launch schedule has been adjusted to further enhance the game’s overall quality and deliver the best possible gameplay experience. To ease the disappointment of Hunters eagerly awaiting the official release, the demo version will remain playable according to the previously announced schedule. Please see below for more details.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Schedule</em><br>
<em>– Demo: 11/17 (Mon) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em><br>
<em>– Early Access: 11/21 (Fri) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em><br>
<em>– Official Launch: 11/24 (Mon) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em></p>
<p><em>* The detailed schedule may be subject to change.</em></p>

<p><em>In the remaining time, we will continue to dedicate the full capabilities of the OVERDRIVE team to deliver an even more polished and complete version of OVERDRIVE. We ask for your continued interest in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, and we look forward to the day we can finally meet our Hunters.”</em></p>
<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive is due to be released for PC and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Cool and Good Games has confirmed that it will be taking more time to develop Starminer, meaning it will not be coming to Steam Early Access just yet. In an update video, the developers gave the reasons for the time needed with much of it to do with Starminer’s scope and making sure every system works together properly. The good news is that Cool and Good Games will be inviting 500 more testers to provide feedback, allowing the team to scale the game properly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dev Update | Developers to Community" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbuAvV6XeH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is no new release window for Starminer, but the dev team did recently provide answers in a recent Q&amp;A. In terms of release, Cool and Good Games have stated it will be able to determine that through the next phase of beta testing. The team has also confirmed it is working on a feature to allow players to share blueprints of their spacestations with others, and there are no build limits so stations can grow as big as you want them to. Starminer will have campaign, sandbox, and survival modes. The campaign will help players get to grips with Starminer’s systems while allowing some creative freedom, and you will learn more about the game’s lore through this mode too. Sandbox is a much more customisable experience allowing choices of starting ship, starting location, and whether enemies are active. Survival will have players facing endless waves of enemies with the goal to stay alive for as long as possible. Physics also plays a crucial part in Starminer with structural integrity and mass really impacting how your station moves. You can move using direct controls though the team is also working on a point and click navigation system too. You will also be able to manage the power levels of ships, allowing you to toggle consumption of various modules including factories, shields, and lasers.</p>
<p>In Starminer, your goal is to build an interstellar mining fleet to find resources among the asteroids in space, and sell those resources for profit. However, doing so will incur the wrath of alien civilisations that will do all that they can to stop you from stripping areas of resources. To counter them you can have warships and defense platforms as part of your fleet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NASCAR 25 Review – Heart-pounding racing action]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nascar-25-review-%E2%80%93-heart-pounding-racing-action.1331191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>A little bit of context goes a long way. Just like Drive to Survive brought thousands of new fans to Formula 1, NASCAR: Full Speed has done a good job of selling the American-based racing series to places that think Daytona is just an old Sega game and that NASCAR drivers only know how to turn left. NASCAR 25 has a whole new audience to court then, and as the best (and admittedly only) place to properly embody drivers like Denny Hamlin and Ryan Blaney, this could be NASCAR’s breakout year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NASCAR 25 | Official Hype Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEIYrJoXBf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Career mode is framed in moving style by Dale Earnhardt Junior’s journey from a promising rookie to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and it certainly sets the right tone for a game that’s designed to take you to sporting glory. Alongside the on-track action, vehicle tuning, and back-office tinkering, there’s a series of Dale JR Download podcast shows that make the experience feel thoroughly authentic, and bring you right into the thick of the world of NASCAR.</p>


<p>Creating a character is as laughably short as inputting a name, but you’ll be glad to discover that there’s a whole suite of much more important customisation options beyond that, letting you choose your car and team logo, your racing number, and then dig right into the visual look of your car, helmet and race suit. It’s easy and intuitive, and while you might be able to do more with various other racing games, I appreciated the straightforward batch of controls, and you unlock more designs as you progress.</p>


<p>The greatest shade thrown at NASCAR by racing fans around the world is that there’s no art to going round and round in a circle. NASCAR 25 shows that not only are they utterly wrong, but you need to find a place of zen and calm to be in with a hope of taking home a trophy. NASCAR is about driving on the absolute knife-edge of speed, holding your racing line, staying out of trouble, and doing so consistently, lap after lap. There isn’t anything easy in that, and frankly, I found it utterly mesmerising. Also, some of the tracks do actually have corners, with races at COTA, Sonoma, Watkins Glen and some street circuits as well, depending on the championship.</p>
<p>Somehow, the fact that your input has to be so precise, so smooth, and so controlled, makes your heart thump with the force of a punctured tyre. While Days of Thunder famously said that rubbing is racing, you’re ideally going to work your way through the pack without too much friction, finding yourself let loose by the minute mistakes made by other drivers. Honestly, it’s about the most edge-of-the-seat racing experience I’ve had in, well, forever. There’s no rewind, only a restart, and the smallest mistake can be the difference between the top 5 and 35th. It feels excellent.</p>

<p>Completing events sees you earning Rep. That’s not just based on where you finished the race, but also hitting your target in practice and qualifying, your lap speed, leading a race, and whether you raced clean. That last one is perhaps the hardest one to earn – there’s bound to be at least a little jostling in the pack – but it gives you other things to target beyond that elusive first place, and it can lead to better opportunities with sponsors, and the opportunity to earn more money.</p>
<p>There’s another reason to keep things clean, as each part of your car carries a Performance Rating. If you damage them, it’ll affect the overall performance of your vehicle, making it much tougher to perform well on race day. You’ll also get a social media blast from your opponents if they feel like you weren’t exactly trying not to run into them, and some of these definitely raised a few wry smiles along the way.</p>

<p>The pace of NASCAR 25’s Career mode might also raise a few more smiles, as it has options that allow it to be punchier and faster than you’d expect from the notoriously long-winded category. At a mere 7% race length, Practice, Qualifying and the race itself might see you complete as few as 5 to 10 laps in total, and then the back office repairs and PR choices tend to be fairly straightforward and binary. Repair decisions do become slightly tougher later on as you balance resources and cash, but the admin definitely takes a back seat to the on-track action.</p>
<p>Fans of NASCAR will be glad to know that you can race each race to its full length, and one of NASCAR 25’s greatest strengths is its adjustability. You can opt for a much lighter sim experience, dialling down the length, difficulty and damage, or you can move all the sliders to the right and make things as realistic and challenging as possible. What shines throughout is the handling model, which feels absolutely tuned in. Playing with controller is certainly an easier experience, but if you want the closest thing to being on track yourself, grab your steering wheel and check out just how good NASCAR 25 feels.</p>
<p>As you progress through Career mode, you move up through the different race categories, and you can participate in the Craftsmen Truck series at the same time, with races happening through the same weekend, maximising your time on track, which, depending on where you are could be a blessing or a curse. Your team changes and evolves as you progress too, and you can fire and hire new staff in each crucial role, giving you a boost when it comes to repairs, or helping you to gain more Rep. You may find yourself becoming strangely attached to them, and I felt a few twinges of guilt as I sacked a staff member that had been with me for a while.</p>
<p>While the Career mode is likely the main draw, you’ve got the option of Quick Race, Championship and 40-player online multiplayer to sink your teeth into as well. The multiplayer is often as chaotic as you’d expect, but if you hit upon the Goldilocks of lobbies, it’s a great experience, with reliably smooth performance and connection. Through these modes, there’s also a full roster of racers, from Cup Series stars like Byron, Hill and Reddick through to up and coming drivers like Brenden Queen and Andres Perez. The whole thing feels thoroughly authentic.</p>

<p>While this might be the premier rendition of the racing category, there’s a few elements that occasionally make it feel like slightly more of a budget release than you might be expecting. Some visual elements of the UI are very basic, and while there’s customisation, your character doesn’t even get the option of a placeholder image, or an actual character model. The car upgrade system also doesn’t extend very far beyond the fact that more expensive parts are better, which is a shame, and definitely loses out on an injection of depth into your downtime between races.</p>

		<p>Valve has released a new feature for Steam so people can discover games they may be interested in, as well as keeping an eye on games that they are already interested in. The new feature is the Personal Calendar, which displays games that have been recently released and is also populated with games that you may be interested in based on playtimes of similar users and the games they have been wishlisting. The feature is currently a Steam Labs experiment, so it will likely have changes made to it. You can check out your own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/personalcalendar?snr=1_2108_9__2107">calendar at the link.</a></p>
<p>The Personal Calendar only has Monday to Friday showing due to games rarely being released on weekends, and it will cover a rolling eight week period so it is not overwhelming. You can further customise the calendar to filter out different tags and determine how many game recommendations it is showing, with the default set to 100. It is also already populated with games that you have wishlisted, so you can see when a game you are wanting to play is going to be released. The recommendations themselves will be updated daily, but Valve does not see the recommended games changing too often due to the parameters that have been set. This is because as well as using similar profiles to provide recommendations, Steam will also take into account the games you are and have been playing, using the most played ones to populate the calendar too.</p>


<p>When it comes to the feedback Valve is looking for, the company has said, <em>“Really, we’re interested to know whatever feedback you may have about this experiment. Do you find this format of recommendations to be useful? What do you think about this new set of recommendations and calendar view? Are there other things we should include on the calendar? Does it seem to be generating good recommendations for you?”</em></p>
