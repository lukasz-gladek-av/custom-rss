		<p>Having been announced under the codename Project Defiant, Sony has now revealed more about the FlexStrike wireless fight stick. The stick is still in development, but will be viewable at Evo 2025 in Las Vegas, building up to a release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="FlexStrike Wireless Fight Stick - Features Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTGmg6uYXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The FlexStrike is compatible with both PS5 and PC, using either a wired connection or their ultra-low latency PlayStation Link USB dongle. The fight stick has mechanical switch buttons with toolless swappable restrictor gates – there are square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that can be kept within storage compartments for the gates and the USB adapter. Additionally, the stick will come with a handy sling carry case, so you can take it wherever you need to get some fighting done. Digitally.</p>
<p>There’s some good quality of life features around all of this. That PlayStation Link dongle is an updated version of the one that shipped with the Pule Elite and Pule Explore headset and earbuds, now with USB-C – it’s not entirely clear if the original dongle will get a firmware update, but we’d expect it to. One dongle allows for simultaneous fight stick and audio use, and on PS5, one dongle will let two fight sticks connect for couch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The control inputs can be customised with a built-in lever mode switch for directional input tweaks, and a lock button to prevent accidental inputs and layout changes in a match.</p>

<p>While the FlexStrike has got many of the same game inputs as found on the DualSense controller, and has a touchpad, there will be software support to let it run at the same time as a DualSense controller, if you’d rather use the gamepad for menu navigation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After reading The Lord of the Rings, the last thing on my mind was wanting to be a Hobbit. No, I categorically wanted to be Legolas, growing my hair and joining the University Archery Society, spending a year enjoying the fine art of putting arrows in a massive circle. If I couldn’t be Legolas, though, then it would have been Strider, and then probably Gimli or Gandalf in that order. Frodo and Sam might be the ostensible heroes, but as the everyman they’re not… well… very cool, are they? And frankly, my own feet are hairy enough already.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of the Shire | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XabBAJdc964?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, as an adult person, with adult constraints, tasks and responsibilities, the Hobbits’ way of life is far more alluring than the detached, changeable, emotionally reserved elves. Here we have a race that has made elevenses a religion, whose pantries are always full, and who can nap, eat and smoke at any time of day without anyone raising an eyebrow.</p>


<p>Their beautifully decorated underground homes are also warm, cosy and ever so appealing – even more so with the state of the current real-world housing market. This is the perfect time then to discover Tales of the Shire, a cosy life sim that lets you become the Hobbit of your dreams, and there’s not an adventure in sight.</p>
<p>You’ve got to give a suitably Hobbity name to your Hobbit, and thankfully, there’s a range of pre-made ones to mix and match from if you don’t quite feel as creative as Tolkien. Enter Odo Lightfoot, or maybe Myrtle Mugwort. It’s interesting to find a game where the character creator has as many options for foot hair as it does for hair on your head, but overall, this is a limited character creator compared to most. Still, you can make a fair approximation of Sam, Frodo, Merry or Pippin, and that’s probably the important thing.</p>


<p>Your first task is to become a local of Bywater. This Hobbit town is made mention of in the series as a crucial location in the fight back against Saruman, but there’s no sign of vindictive wizards here, just an array of green pastures, blooming flowers and one rundown Hobbit Hole for you to bring back to life.</p>
<p>Food is the key to a Hobbit’s heart, and that’s as true as ever here. Progress is fundamentally tied to making meals, sharing them with townsfolk, and levelling up your relationship with each of them through bribery-based friendship. The better your ingredients, the better your meals, and you go through a short series of tasks to prepare each one. These are pretty simple, but they do make you feel slightly more like a cook than someone clicking through menus.</p>
<p>Things are complicated by each dish’s sweet spot. You have to prepare and cook dishes to a particular level, with a scale between smooth and chunky, between tender and crisp, and if you manage to do that, alternating in how much you chop or cook each component, you’ll make your dish much tastier, greatly increasing its impact on the diner.</p>

<p>I particularly like some of the little touches the team have included, like the birds that serve as your route finders, fluttering from signpost to arch to wall as you go about your business. It’s such a smart and natural way to direct your play that I wonder why I haven’t seen it before – the closest might be the wind blowing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>
<p>One of the other key things you’ll spend your time doing, is tidying, designing and expanding your Hobbit Hole. It’s a bit of a wreck when you arrive, and the first thing you’ll want to do is clear up. Thankfully, this is very well done, and the controls are clear and easy to use, making moving, rotating and setting items pleasingly easy.</p>
<p>It’s also very detailed, so you can place mugs and bottles on shelves or the floor, filling places with clutter if you want, or going for a new-age Hobbit Feng Shui where everything points in the right direction. I do wish there were a gyro option on Switch, for a perfect level of precision, but it works suitably well without.</p>

<p>The Switch version A Hobbit’s Tale looks distinctly pared back, and frankly, it’s a little ugly. The character models look less detailed, and there’s clear pop-in of level furniture, with flowers and other details magically appearing as you walk towards them. What it does mean is that everything runs relatively smoothly, and the overall presentation remains charming, but it’s definitely not a looker on the older handheld, and it’s limited to compatibility modes on the Switch 2 – hopefully a patch or upgrade is forthcoming.</p>
<p>A further disappointment is that there’s no recorded speech, and only minimal grunts and exclamations made by characters during conversation. It gives every encounter a strange silence, a disconnect, and it really robs speech of any emotional depth at all. Even if it was shorter portions of speech that give a flavour of the full written dialogue – like we’ve seen in series like Fire Emblem – that would have breathed so much more life into the characters here.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the beautiful soundtrack helps to draw your attention away from any other audio/visual deficiencies. It manages to capture the nature of the films, with finely drawn, gentle orchestration emphasising the arable fantasy, letting you truly embody the Hobbit way of life. It’s about as perfectly tuned to its task as possible, and while you’re cooking, cleaning, renovating and removing, it provides an excellent aural backdrop.</p>

<p>Now, Tales of the Shire is going to appeal to a very particular sort of person. Some might decry the limited Lord of the Rings connections – at least those who expect to be walloping orcs with swords – but there’s a heap of Animal Crossing here, alongside some Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons, wrapped up in a thoroughly convincing Lord of the Rings landscape. For fans of cosy gaming, those for whom a busy little fantasy life is what they want at the end of a day, rather than a grand adventure, Tales of the Shire is a gentle and lovingly crafted entry in the genre.</p>

		<p>If you’re hopping into the latest Soulslike to hit players in the head with a sneak attack, then you’ll want to know how levelling works in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. While it bears some similarities to games you’re likely more familiar with, like Dark Souls, it has enough little quirks that we think it’s worth going into the specifics to make sure you know what you’re getting into.</p>


<p>As with so many of these games, you will be collecting a single currency called Red Mercury. In its base form, you can spend on items and whatnot from different merchants. However, to level up, you need to refine it into Red Mercury Essence. These are sort of like your stat points, and you can spend them in the Impetus Repository at the shrines you rest at, to unlock different skills.</p>


<p>The first time you open this, it’ll seem very bare. This is because skills are tied to different weapon skill trees. Each of the weapons in the game has a specific tree you can follow that not only unlocks better mastery with that weapon, but also stats relevant to that weapon as well. For example, the one-handed sword tree lets you boost your magic stat and your feathering stat.</p>


<p>It’s worth exploring the different weapon types at least a little bit, because each of them has a different combination of stats to it, but also some of the passives are game-changing when it comes ot how you play the game.</p>
<p>Never feel bad for exploring either, because you can actually reset your invested points whenever you want with no actual penalty. That’s a huge deal in games like this, because the chances are you’re not going to know exactly what play style you’ll actually like until you’ve been playing for a little while.</p>
