		<p>Nintendo has announced through its Nintendo Today app that The Legend of Zelda movie will no longer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/">arrive in cinemas in March 2027</a>. Instead, a brand new release date of May 7th, 2027 has been given. The only reason that has been given is that this delay is due to production reasons, and no further information has been provided apart from that.</p>



<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>There are no details of any cast announcements for The Legend of Zelda movie, nor is there any details of what story this movie will have. We do not know if the movie will adapt one of the games or be an original plot, introducing new elements to The Legend of Zelda lore.</p>
