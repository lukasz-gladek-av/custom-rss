		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, a long-awaited remake of a classic entry in the series and a new spin-off to go alongside. The bundled pair will launch on 11th February 2026 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, PS4, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 is exactly what you’d want it to be, a modernising remake of the first PS3 Yakuza game, revitalising another chapter in Kazuma Kiryu’s story for current consoles. While the game has been playable through a port of the PS3 era trilogy, it was a pretty sharp step back from the quality found in the PS4 remakes of the first two Yakuza games – Yakuza Kiwami and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> – which made use of newer game engines and technology built for Yakuza 0 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/16/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-review/">Yakuza 6</a>. Even those remakes are getting on a bit, though. Kiwami 2 was released way back in 2017 (and localised in 2018).</p>
<p>Still, Yakuza 3 did have its own innovations compared to the PS2 originals. Seamless Battle allowed for more connected fights without a loading screen, Chase Battle added higher paced fights through more environments, Revelation brought a new way to learn Heat Actions, and there was a first person view.</p>
<p>One of the great things here is that the Nintendo Switch 2 is being included on day one. Switch 2 owners had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/yakuza-0-directors-cut-review-switch-2/">an enhanced port of Yakuza 0 at console’s launch</a>, which is being followed up by a fresh port of Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 later this year. Clearly this was all part of the plan to bring this new audience up to speed in time for Kiwami 3!</p>

<p>Alongside the remake of Yakuza 3 is Dark Ties, telling a brand new story around the character Yoshitaka Mine. Here’s a little blurb:</p>
<p>Having once led a succesful startup company, he plunged himself into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat, and a variety of engaging side experiences.</p>
<p>Two men will walk different paths that converge to shake the very foundations of fate.</p>

		<p>LilliLandia Games, which is a Tencent Studio, has announced a new fantasy simulation game called Animula Nook. It is being billed as a lilliput game and for those who are not sure what that means, lilliput comes from Jonathan Swift’s Guilliver’s Travels. Lilliput is the island where the six inch tall Lilliputlians live, and that should give you a clue of what to expect in Animula Nook.</p>
<p><iframe title="Animula Nook | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvaGN-R2ntc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Animula Nook, what is normal sized to us tower above the characters that live in this world. House plants are towering trees and forgotten little things like buttons can be major resources. This is essentially The Borrowers the videogame. The key features have been detailed by LilliLandia Games, and you can read the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Discover a tiny yet immense world:&nbsp;Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect beyond the ordinary:&nbsp;In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Build with everyday objects:&nbsp;Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Befriend the world’s tiny folk:&nbsp;This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Define yourself in every detail:&nbsp;Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Convenient creative tools:&nbsp;Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</em></li>
</ul>
