		<p>Given that the game has recently been delayed no one was expecting <del>the Spanish Inquisition</del> a second official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, but here it is!</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, and an unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>The new trailer names that male counterpart, he’s called Jason, and seems to be working as a handyman. After that its exactly what you would expect from a GTA game: Car chases, gun fights, boats, planes, and a bit of sexy stuff on the side. It’s all sound tracked by the brilliant “Hot Together” by the Pointer Sisters, a nod to the relationship between Jason and Lucia.</p>
<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>

<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>
<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>
