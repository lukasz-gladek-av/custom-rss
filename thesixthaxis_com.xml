		<p>Devolver Digital has confirmed that Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven, the new DLC content for the sheep based strategy game, will be launching on January 22nd. As part of the announcement, a new trailer has been released with a majority showing an animation that seems to set up events, while the latter part gives a look at some of the gameplay in small snippets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Date Trailer | Launching on January 22" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven players are tasked with finding the souls of dead Lambs for Yngya, the God of Winter. With each soul, Yngya gets stronger and the challenges for the Cult can get more difficult. As well as appeasing Yngya, you need to survive the cold winter that has descended on the land. You will need to keep cult members fed and warm so they do not freeze, there are new traits and quests to discover, and you will be able to expand your base. There are also new structures such as the Exorcism Altar, and you can expand the base with new shops and a ranch.</p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will also have two new dungeons, and those are Ewefall and The Rot. Ewefall is the exterior snowy part of the mountain which is the domain of Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack. The Free Pack are not welcoming to the Gods and will not let them have the mountain, so they have to be defeated. The Rot is the interior of the mountain where anything living inside is corrupted. In The Rot, some of the quests include helping a dragon hatch her eggs and making a garden bloom.</p>

<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Switch.</p>

		<p>The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive have released the Winter Update for Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, with one of the main features being custom difficulty. With this, players can change things like starting health, the amount of damage Phyre can inflict, and allows passive ability recharging. However, this is not a setting that is accessible for new players but those who have the An Elder Unchained achievement or trophy. Custom difficulty cannot be changed after a playthrough has started either.</p>
<p>In addition to the custom difficulty option, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is getting some suitably festive and Christmassy items including a Santa hat and beard, with The Chinese Room also confirming beards will be added in a later update. An FOV Slider and a Motion Blur Toggle have also been added, and you can read the full patch notes below.</p>
