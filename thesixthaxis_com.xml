		<p>The travails of Grand Theft Auto 6 really are a sign of just how much game development has changed over the decades. There were three GTAs on PS2, there were two on PS3, and now we’re lucky to see one big game a generation from Rockstar – I think we ought to really count Red Dead Redemption 2 in this. It’s something that’s echoed by the likes of Naughty Dog, where the most prestigious studios now take what feels like forever to produce their games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m talking about that because GTA 6 got delayed by another six months.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week, closely followed by the back and forth over work unionisation at Rockstar. Let’s get to those and all the other biggest stories we’ve caught.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman </strong>told us tales of Conquistadorio and Thimbleweed Park, the former having more of a Machinarium tone, and the latter being akin to a classic LucasArts point and clicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>
