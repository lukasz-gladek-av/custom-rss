		<p>Developer People Can Fly has confirmed that they have entered into an agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, producing a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta that is based on an IP owned by Sony.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of unknowns here, of course, and while the wording seems to imply that PCF is creating a new game based on established IP – and this is also described as ‘work for hire’ contract – it can also be read to mean that Sony will own the IP of whatever PCF create. At this point, Project Delta is just a prototype project, though Sony is funding the production at this stage – as is typical for this kind of work – and it’s obviously hoped that they will get the greenlight at each stage of development to continue.</p>


<p>Given the codename of Project Delta, though, why not rampantly speculate that this is a SOCOM reboot? Delta would obviously be an allusion to Delta Force, which is a unit of SOCOM.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as part of an investor report, with People Can Fly a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It’s similar to why we have such detailed disclosures and roadmaps from independent studios like CD Projekt Red and Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<p>The company has numerous codenamed projects in development though recently had to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">step back from self-publishing efforts with Project Victoria and Bifrost, leading to layoffs</a>. However, they are working on Project Gemini with Square Enix, Project Echo with Krafton and has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">confirmed as co-developed on Gears of War E-Day</a> (formerly Project Maverick).</p>

<p>Here’s a translation of <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf">PCF’s investor report</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Management Board of PCF Group S.A. with its registered office in Warsaw (the “Company”) hereby informs that on March 13, 2025, the Company entered into a production agreement (Prototype Development Agreement) (the “Production Agreement”) with Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, with its registered office in San Mateo, California, United States of America (the “Publisher”), regarding cooperation in the production of a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta (the “Product”), based on intellectual property rights belonging to Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called work-for-hire model, i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on behalf of and for the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive an agreed remuneration from the Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). Detailed terms of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation and payment for subsequent stages (milestones) have been specified in the annex to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule).</em></p>
<p><em>The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not differ substantially from the provisions of production agreements typically concluded for such projects.</em></p>
<p><em>The conclusion of the Production Agreement is in line with the update of the Company’s Strategy and the People Can Fly capital group announced by the Company on 31 January 2023, according to which if attractive opportunities for cooperation with renowned partners in the work-for-hire model arise, the Company will take advantage of them.</em></p>

		<p>Zynga has announced that it will be shutting down Star Wars Hunters on October 1st, with the final season dropping on April 15th. The shutdown will come near enough four years after Star Wars Hunters first soft launched, which occurred in November 2021 in some countries. The game then released worldwide in early 2022. The full statement regarding the shutdown can be read below.</p>
