			<p>Almost 30 years on from its debut, Tomb Raider is still one of the most recognisable names in gaming. Sure, we’re quite far removed from the series’ heyday, and are currently in a lull for both the modern games and movies, but Lara Croft’s adventures haven’t been entombed and forgotten by the public. Revisiting the original games seems like a great idea, to go back and have a look at where it all started. After playing these remakes, I have to say that maybe they are better left in our memories where the nostalgia can do all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vF9-JeSRRaI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now let’s get this straight, the remasters here are precisely what you expect them to be. We’ve got better quality textures, better lighting, and much better quality character models, which if you’re not familiar with the original PlayStation, didn’t really have many more polygons than the absolute minimum needed for a humanoid silhouette. You can jump between the new remastered visuals to the original graphics with the press of a button – something that still amazes me every time I see it, even if it’s a common trick for retro remasters.</p>



<p>But this second trilogy of Tomb Raider games is a bit different from the first, jumping ahead a generation to Angel of Darkness for the PS2 – Core Design’s sixth and final game in the series. After playing the first two games it can be a little hard to tell if you’re looking at a remastered version or the original in Angel of Darkness, until you examine things a little more closely. Lara’s model is the biggest giveaway, which is noticeably improved, but with the environments it’s hard to really spot the difference, some things even look untouched.</p>

<p>The biggest issue here is that this isn’t the ground breaking original Tomb Raider trilogy, it’s the second trilogy where Lara didn’t really know what to do with herself. The first two games are very much in line with their predecessors mostly, but even in the late 90s they were critiqued for retreading increasingly familiar ground. Heck, Core Design even tried to kill off their iconic heroine in The Last Revelation, only to have to create a kind of narrative clip show for Chronicles, while another team worked to bring her back for a jump to the new generation.</p>

<p>Angel of Darkness looked to revitalise the series, though making Lara into some kind of anti-hero in one of the weirder turns I’ve seen a series take. It’s not very good either, nor is it good at making it clear where you’re supposed to be going in the streets and rooftops of Paris that replace the tombs you’d expect to be raiding earlier on. There’s some cut content that’s been restored here with the Parisian Back Streets training area, and some other tweaks to subtly improve Angel of Darkness’ flaws, but these three games just aren’t Tomb Raider 1-3, which makes me far less willing to forgive the issues that remain.</p>
<p>Controls are still the biggest problem with these games, even if you still have the muscle memory from playing the original releases. The difficulty in these games comes almost entirely from absolutely horrendously bad tank controls, as they’re known, where left and right turn your character on the spot instead of strafing. Every single little thing you do, whether it’s pulling a lever, reaching a ledge, jumping for a rope, whatever, is made into a frustrating battle with the controls whilst you try to maneouvre yourself into just the right position.</p>

<p>A simple jump isn’t simple anymore, because you have to ensure you’re positioned perfectly beforehand, so it becomes a case of stopping and rotating on the spot before you can continue. Are you lined up right to grab that rope from a jump, or will you end up being two inches too far to the left? It doesn’t feel like “real” difficulty – as in, Dark Souls is difficult but it’s a challenge that’s fun to surmount, these remasters never feel challenging, they just feel annoying and success is just relief that you’re finally rid of whatever fiddly rubbish you were doing rather than celebrating overcoming a challenge.</p>
<p>As with the first batch of remasters, this trilogy does also come with a modern control setting that allows you to, shockingly, point your analog in a direction and move in that direction rather than turning like a tank. This is a little bit better when walking around but, once you get into a small platform that you need to rotate on so you can position yourself, you’ll likely walk off the edge trying to do it. There’s also the awkwardness of moving when the camera switches to fixed positions, and more generally, the run animation has to end for a moment before you can start moving again.. These games were designed with tank controls in mind, so annoying as they are, manoeuvring without them is almost as frustrating.</p>
<p>There isn’t much else to say really. The first two games look nicer than they once did, the third looks almost the same, and other than that the games are so old that they came from before controls stopped being terrible. I’ve always wondered why I didn’t really like the Tomb Raider games, never made much progress, and mostly messed around in the mansion. It turns out it’s because they’re bad? If Aspyr decide the remake the next trilogy of Tomb Raider games, though, it will begin with Tomb Raider Legend, the first genuinely good Tomb Raider because Lara, the titular tomb raider, can climb a wall without five minutes of prep first.</p>

		<p>It’s always nice to start the day with some positivity, especially when the gaming world seems to be mostly redundancies and failures right now. NACON have brought the sunshine today though, with the announcement of Edge of Memories, the sequel to the fantastic JRPG Edge of Eternity. They’ve even brought us a lovely announcement trailer to go with it, which you’ll find below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08wjvnGkQQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The observant amongst you may notice the change to the art direction from the first game, and I’m sure that’s likely to be divisive for returning fans, leaning into more of an anime or French animation look rather than the original’s Unreal Engine-powered Final Fantasy-esque visuals. There’s some serious talent at work on Edge of Memories too, including character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles X), while the rest of the team includes writer Sawako Natori (NieR), singer Emi Evans (NieR / NieR: Automata), as well as composers Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger/ Xenogears) and Mariam Abounnasr (Xenoblade Chronicles 3 / ONINAKI). This should have anyone who knows in fits of excitement!</p>
<p>The original Edge of Eternity launched in 2021, and went on to sell over a million copies, making a follow-up something of a no-brainer. Despite its JRPG trappings, and the various members of the team that hail from there, Midgar Studios is actually based in France, and they’re returning once more for Edge of Memories.</p>


<p>The story synopsis tells us, “The beautiful, serene landscapes of Avaris are under the threat of a powerful corrupting influence, Corrosion, as it spreads across the land. Mutating anything in its path into horrific abominations. As a Soul Whisperer, it’s your job to travel the world, easing the people of their burdens, and fighting back against the monsters inhabiting the world. During her journey, Eline awakens to a mysterious power that may hold the answer to thwarting the oncoming apocalypse.” Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>If the trailer has piqued your interest, or you’re a fan of the original game, Edge of Memories will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in Autumn 2025. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on this one!</p>

			<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO Announcement Images</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Let’s face it, an MMO is the greatest timesink in the gaming world, and it’s one that can create and develop stories, adventures and friendships that most games can only dream about. Blade and Soul NEO has remastered and remade the highly successful Korean MMO Blade and Soul, and brought it kicking and higher kicking back to the forefront of multiplayer gaming. It’s also Free To Play, and, as of <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer#LaunchTrailer">yesterday, available to download now</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Blade &amp; Soul NEO: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2212dxe4aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blade &amp; Soul remains one of the biggest Korean MMOs of all time, and despite the fact that the sequel arrived five years ago, it’s a beloved property that players continue to return to 12 years after its original release. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will see players transported back to the Wuxia-themed fantastical world, so that they can experience the story and gameplay once more with modernised graphics and improved systems.</p>
<p>A free-to-play MMO set in a world of Asian mythology, combat has always been the star of Blade &amp; Soul, and it looks to be carefully reinterpreted here in the updated Unreal Engine 4. There’s new combat techniques to learn, and the fighting system, which has more in common with fighting games than it does with most RPGs, has gained even more depth, which will be perfect for returning players. It certainly looks beautiful, and if you check out the new trailer you can see the side-by-side comparisons between the original and the NEO version.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features has been the inclusion of Infinite Windwalk, an ability that was originally limited by your character’s stamina meter. Now you can take to the skies, and you’ll be able to get around the world with your party of players in a much more efficient and enjoyable length of time.</p>


<p>The renewed character customisation options also take advantage of the enhanced visuals, with player characters now more visually impressive than ever before. You can even download and share your character template for other players to use, and this is a great feature if you see a design you simply must have.</p>
<p>Make sure to check this one out, especially if you’ve got an MMO shaped hole in your life.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. shuts down Monolith, Player First Games & WB Games San Diego]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warner Bros. has confirmed reports that they are shutting down three of their game studios, closing Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego is what they’re describing as a “strategic change in direction”.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>, the publisher’s statement says, “We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.”</p>


<p>Of particular note is the closure of Monolith Productions, who was working on a Wonder Woman video game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">first announced in 2021</a>. This game was the subject of reporting earlier this month that stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/report-rocksteady-working-on-single-player-batman-as-wonder-woman-game-rebooted/">the game’s development had been rebooted</a> within the last year after creative leads left the studio.</p>
<p>Monolith’s last game was Middle-earth: Shadow of War, back in 2017, the studio having pioneered the patented Nemesis system with their first Middle-earth game three years earlier. However, the studio’s storied history goes back much further with landmark titles like FEAR, the niche and kitschy No One Lives Forever, and Aliens vs. Predator 2.</p>
<p>Player First Games was the studio behind online multiplayer brawler MultiVersus, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">burst onto the scene with its open beta in 2022</a>, but ultimately flopped at its 2024 relaunch, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">recently sunset by WB</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, WB Games San Diego was a studio founded in 2019 and had reportedly been working on an unannounced “AAA, free-to-play, cross-platform game.”</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been struggling for quite some time, it seems, and these three studios are seeing the wider consequences of those struggles. This feels like less of a “change in direction” and more about WB making a cold financial decision. Wonder Woman’s long-running development will have been very costly, and there was seemingly no end in sight, while Player First would have been right back at the start of the development cycle. “AAA, free-to-play” has also gone from seeming like a sure bet to company execs to a massive risk.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how many jobs are being lost as part of these studio closures, and Warner Bros. has not publicly explained what redundancy and support packages they will be offering to those affected.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go to those suddenly out of work, and hope that they can find new employment soon.</p>
