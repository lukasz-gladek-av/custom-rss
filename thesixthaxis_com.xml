		<p>After years of delays, Capcom has confirmed the release date for their astronaut and girl action adventure Pragmata. The game will launch on 24th April for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and… Switch 2! Oh, and there’s a demo out today for PC, coming to other platforms soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hugh the astronaut has popped over to the Moon to figure out what’s gone wrong at a big lunar base. After getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for the less catchy DI02367. The two form a fast bond, not least because Diana can hack the very angry androids with a quick puzzle minigame to enable you to deal damage. This new trailer shows off some big set piece moments that will push that concept as far as possible.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> earlier this year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. We finally have that firm release date, which is very nice, and PC players should check out the Steam demo.</p>

		<p>The Free Shepherd has been revealed by Frame Interactive, an atmospheric adventure where a border collie has lost all their sheep! The game is set to release for PC and PS5 in 2027.</p>

<p>It’s a very Little Bo-Peep kind of story, where all of the sheep this sheepdog has been looking after have disappeared, so you’ll set out to find them across a sweeping landscape. It is rather lovely looking, especially with a very expressively animated star at its heart.</p>

		<p>As is tradition, someone somewhere has published information a little too early about a game that is almost certainly going to be revealed later on tonight at The Game Awards. This year Lara Croft can take home not one, but two shiny “Someone pressed the TGA button to soon” awards as two Tomb Raider games have leaked.</p>
<p>The first is Tomb Raider Catalyst, which leaked artwork, synopsis, and the entire trailer, although Amazon has been very quick to take the latter down. It is set for release in 2027 for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and finds Lara on a new expedition across Northern India.</p>


<p><em>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst folows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.”</em></p>

<p>The second game, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a “reimagining” of the very first Lara Croft adventure.</p>

<p><em>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</em></p>
<p>If you really want to watch the trailer for that then you can find it in super low res with no sound over on 4chan, I suggest you don’t. I had a look on your behalf and it looks very much like the first Tomb Raider but all modern, so exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and both games are being made by Crystal Dynamics and published by Amazon.&nbsp; They are also making a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/04/sophie-turner-is-lara-croft-in-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series/">Tomb Raider TV series</a> with &nbsp;Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role.</p>
<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>

		<p>Have you been keen to step into the 3D meat space of Super Meat Boy 3D? Well there’s no need to wait for PC gamers, as a Super Meat Boy 3D demo is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3288210/Super_Meat_Boy_3D/">live on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Coming as a slight precursor to The Game Awards tonight, this is a newly updated version of the demo that was playable at Gamescom earlier this year.</p>


<p>The Super Meat Boy 3D demo features 10 levels from the full game, giving a look at two worlds –&nbsp;the squirrel-infested Forest and the trash-filled Wastes. Of course, this will be just a taster, an apertif for what’s in store, which is laid out by the following blurb:</p>
<p><em>Super Meat Boy 3D is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar—IN 3D! You’ll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way—IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before—IN (say it with me!) 3D!</em></p>
<p>Yup, there’s boss fights in this one.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a PC, or want to save the experience for later, hopefully you won’t have to wait too long. Super Meat Boy 3D coming in early 2026 to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and coming day one to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>
