		<p>As is tradition for Sony, and for me writing about them, it’s time to take a look at the weird advert to sell PlayStations over the holiday season. This time there are three vignettes rather than one longer ad and as usual they do not feature any games, or indeed PlayStation consoles, instead, they sell an idea which this years is “anything can happen on PlayStation”.</p>
<p>The first advert is clearly influenced by Grand Theft Auto and finds a driver waking up in a truck which has landed somewhere unexpected.&nbsp; Unfortunately, YouTube still gives away exactly where that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 - Stunt Jump" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woGbrJqimvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second advert is set on a fishing trawler which has landed a monstrous creature, but there is a twist in the tale that isn’t spoiled by YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 – Unexpected Catch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uyYzIT7kNUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The third and final advert is just very odd. Two survivors from a wrecked spaceship spot a truck heading their way which is driven by an older woman and not much else happens.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It Happens On PS5 – Crash Landings" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTi78EVDDJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sony usually pack these adverts with Easter eggs but I really cannot see that many this year. The truck in the first advert has the PS5 logo on the seat, and an Astro-bot badge can be seen, and the boat in the second advert also has the PS5 logo. The palm tree air freshener in the truck may be something but I cannot make any connection, and there is a wooden monster head at the back of the truck in the first head which again may be a reference, what do you think?</p>
<p>The adverts have rather more impact that last year’s effort which just features lots of people bouncing around for no reason.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc">&nbsp;one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened fourteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it will start delisting Football Manager 2024 from storefronts, and the process will begin on November 5th. The reason for the delisting is the end of license agreements and new ones likely being agreed for Football Manager 26. There does not seem to be any kind of discount for Football Manager 2024 ahead of its delisting. The dates for the delistings are below.</p>



<p>As you can see from the table, Football Manager 2024 will be delisted tomorrow from Steam and the Epic Games Store, including the demo. Then on November 16th the game will be removed from Windows Store, PC Game Pass, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Game Pass. On 18th November, Football Manager 2024 will be removed from PS5’s store, and on December 5th Football Manager 2024 Touch will be removed from the Nintendo Switch Store. Those playing FM24 Touch on Apple Arcade and FM24 Mobile via Netflix will be able to upgrade to Football Manager 26.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 2024 review I wrote, “There’s a lot of depth to Football Manager 2024, but how deep you go is up to you. You can sit back and just focus on the basics of the match day and transfers, or you can all the way to managing individual player training and using the new player targets feature Whatever approach you choose, Football Manager 2024 offers a near full package to start or continue your managerial career.”</p>
