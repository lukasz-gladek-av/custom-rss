		<p>To my great shame, I have never played a Kirby game. This is what I told the gentleman next to me as I picked up the Switch 2 Controller to play the Switch 2 edition of Kirby and the Forgotten Land at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in London.</p>
<p>I am missing out, I was reliably informed, as I embarked on a time preview of one of the early levels of the game. Kirby and Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is definitely one of the clunkiest game titles we have seen on the Switch 2 so far, but it makes sense when you realise it’s a Switch port bundled with a brand new DLC. Fans will be glad to hear that if they already own Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch, they can purchase the upgrade pack to play the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, complete with the DLC.</p>

<p>Around three years ago, we awarded the original Nintendo Switch release <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">a lofty 9/10</a> for being “a gorgeous and vibrant new world to explore”, while also being an excellent 3D platformer for what was traditionally a 2D platforming series. The jump to the Switch 2 has certainly made it more vibrant. The display on the new console is gorgeous, and the jump in specs is certainly welcome, doubling the frame rate from 30fps to 60fps, and running at 1080p in handheld mode and 1440p docked.</p>
<p>The main difference between the Switch 2 version and the original, however, is the Star-Crossed DLC. Rather than adding new maps, it effectively remixes the existing one with an overlay. The world is struck by a whopping great meteor, scattering magical crystals throughout the campaign. Kirby must use his abilities, including some brand new Mouthful Modes, to destroy these crystals and pick up all the collectibles they drop.</p>


<p>The new bits are clearly differentiated from the original campaign in the way they look — the blue mystical gunk really stood out against the luscious green grass in the portion I played at the event in London.</p>
<p>As I played, the guy running the booth told me about how he played through the original campaign with his niece, and was now looking forward to the rerun. That kid is three years older and hopefully still into Kirby, and he was really looking forward to the bonding time and seeing how things would be different this time around, both in terms of the level and how she played the game.</p>

<p>I can see where he’s coming from. I grew up passing the controller to my brothers as we worked our way through the Crash Bandicoot games. Kirby, however, is fully playable in co-op – with the second player taking on the role of Bandana Waddle Dee. My own son is far too young to play this (he’s much more likely to just try and chew the controller), but I am already looking forward to kicking back with my wife and seeing what Kirby and the Wordiest Title on the Switch 2 has to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie have finally revealed their new version of Marathon, a team-based extraction shooter set on the world of Tau Ceti 4. While the gunplay looks classic Bungie the art style is bright and rather cartoonish at times with chunky 8-bit style fonts, lots of neon hues and glitching effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZRGDZCl9pg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will have up to eighteen players battling it out alongside AI enemies, but while you can be in a team of three, you can opt out of matchmaking and play solo if you wish. As an extraction shooter, the idea is to grab as much loot and escape – die and your loot will be dropped and claimed by someone else. More loot means a better loadout for your next run.</p>
<p>The game will feature “events” which have yet to be detailed, dynamic weather, endgame content, community events and seasonal stories. Each runner will have implants which you can use to enhance shields, agility and other abilities.</p>

<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

<p>Marathon will launch on September 23rd 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of Kiddy Apex Lege.. erm, I mean Marathon? Let us know in the comments.</p>
