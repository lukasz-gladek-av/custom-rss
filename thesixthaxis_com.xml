		<p>Solo dev Wootus of Wootusart Industries has announced that the 2D shooter and strategy title War Rats: The Rat em Up will be available in Steam Early Access from April 22nd. In War Rats, you are a Rat commander that has to lead troops into a battle against the forces of TechnoRat. In this world rats are the only inhabitants.</p>

<p><em>“As a solo dev, I would love to involve the players in shaping the game, especially when it comes to balancing. This kind of game can be very challenging for some players while for others it will be a breeze. I feel like Early Access would be a great place to get that balance right. I would also like people to be able to play the Singleplayer portion of the game without having to wait for Multiplayer to be finished”,</em>said Wootus.</p>
<p>War Rats battles are a mix of 2D action where you go and fight the enemy troops, and a base building as you command troops to construct things like turrets. You can also recruit more rat troops to face off against the enemy forces, as going alone will lead to absolute failure. The early access release will contain the full single player campaign as well as a skirmish mode that allows players to choose which map to fight in. The full release of War Rats, which is estimated to come out six months after the early access release, will contain co-op and PvP multiplayer. The additional modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Conquest. There will also be more single player content including horde mode.</p>
