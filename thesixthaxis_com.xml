            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/bioware-is-downsizing-mass-effect-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>BioWare Gnereal Manager Gary McKay has confirmed that the studio has been “downsizing” following the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year and prior to spinning up full development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mass-effect-4">the next Mass Effect game</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-production on a game typically requires a smaller core team, and McKay states that “[BioWare] are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare. […] Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio.”</p>


<p>That’s seemingly coded phrasing for job losses, though he does assert that “over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles”. Hopefully job losses alongside that have actually been minimal, and we hope anyone affected is able to find new work soon.</p>
<p>This is a sign of where the new Mass Effect game is at, and an indication that it will be several years away from release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/08/mass-effect-4-teaser-marks-the-return-of-an-old-enemy/">Having been teased back in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/07/bioware-tease-next-mass-effect-game-with-a-new-image/">and again in 2022</a>, we’ve known for years that a team led by Mike Gamble is in pre-production on the next game. We might have hoped that this would allow for production to scale up following Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s release, but it seems BioWare isn’t quite there yet.</p>
<p>While well received by critics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed EA’s expectations</a>, leading to a cut in financial forecasts – EA Sports FC 25 had a bigger share of the blame, to be fair. Additionally, BioWare released what seems to be <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">the last major update for Veilguard last week</a>, winding down active support to only bug fixes for game-breaking issues.</p>

<p>Here’s the statement from Gary McKay:</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare’s story. As we announced in <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/">August 2023</a>, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team at BioWare is developing the next Mass Effect game under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, and others.</p>
<p>In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p>
<p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p>
<p>Today’s news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare.</p>
<p><em>Gary McKay</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/ps-plus-monthly-games-wont-guarantee-ps4-games-from-january-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/ps-plus-monthly-games-wont-guarantee-ps4-games-from-january-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced an upcoming change to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games. From January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup.</p>
<p>The current balance of games featured in PS Plus monthly games is for two guaranteed PS4 games and one PS5 game. Of course, with cross-gen releases as they are, we’ve often had months where all three games are playable across both generations.</p>


<p>From January 2026, the focus will be on the PlayStation 5 – which makes sense since it will be over half a decade old by that point – and so PS4 games will no longer be a guaranteed part of each month’s selection. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Any already redeemed PS4 games will continue to be playable while subscribed to PS Plus, just as you can still access previous consoles.</p>
<p>This will go hand-in-hand with a shift in focus for securing PS5 games for the PS Plus Game Catalogue, more-so than the PS4. PS4 games will still be a huge part of the service, but again, no longer a key focus.</p>

<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>
<p>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</p>
<p>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-payday-3-high-on-life/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for February 2025 have been announced, and it’s a great one for fans of virtualised heisting with Payday 3 leading the way alongside a zany first person shooter and an arcade classic franchise.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 4th February.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">Payday 3</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pac-Man World Re-Pac | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Payday 3 arrived at the tail end of 2023, and while it made a solid first impression – “a welcome return for the heist ’em up series, and a reminder of why the first two games were so popular,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">I wrote at the time</a> – it faced an uphill battle with its fans. After a year of hefty reworks and patches, and the addition of the classic World First Bank heist in December, could it be worth diving in?</p>
<p>Well, now’s as good a time as any to see how it holds up.</p>


<p>If you’d rather play something solo, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> might be for you. Coming from Squanch Games. Whipping you away to a bizarre alien world where guns have faces and talk back to you, and who have increasingly odd fire modes, and you encounter dozens of incessantly babbling characters in the vein of Rick and Morty as you become a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, you may feel conflicted about this game, due to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/justin-roiland-quits-high-on-life-developer-squanch-games-as-he-faces-domestic-abuse-charges/">the involvement of Justin Roiland</a> in its creation.</p>

<p>Lastly for this month is Pac-Man World Re-Pac, a 2004 remake of the PlayStation platformer with the arcade con now on a quest to rescue his family and friends from Ghosts who saw fit to kidnap them all. And it’s Pac-Man’s birthday to boot!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the January 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab January’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 4th February, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/sony-makes-psn-optional-on-pc-games-with-new-incentives-for-signing-in-spider-man-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has reversed course on one of their most unpopular policies, making having a PlayStation Network account optional on PC. Instead of requiring a PSN log in they will offer incentives for signing up or logging into an existing account.</p>
<p>The change has been made just in time for tomorrow’s release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/spider-man-2-swings-onto-pc-in-january-2025/">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC</a>, and will apply for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered when that releases in April. It is also being rolled back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC</a>, with in-game content unlocks being added soon.</p>


<p>For the rest of the PlayStation Studios library on PC, games with online multiplayer modes will still require PSN – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has online co-op, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-is-coming-to-pc-in-may/">Ghost of Tsushima’s Legends mode</a> will still need PSN, but it is not needed for the single player. The exception to that is that the backlash to adding the requirement to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was so severe that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">Sony backed down before implementing it</a>.</p>
<p>There’s another exception with the completely single-player Until Dawn remake. Hopefully that will be amended soon to have a more clear-cut policy.</p>
<p>Prior to making PSN mandatory last year, Sony had been giving bonus unlocks and content to those logging in – bonus costumes for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/horizon-forbidden-west-pc-specs-confirmed/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, for example – and they’ve basically gone back to that plan.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s coming to the four games mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong> – Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</li>
<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> – Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver&nbsp;and 250 XP)</li>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</strong> – +50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras, Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong> – Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</li>
</ul>
