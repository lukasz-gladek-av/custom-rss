		<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that a good game from the past is still a good game today, but with the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, there’s further proof of concept that the corporate heads over at Squeenix will be paying attention to. While we’ve seen wonderful remakes of games like Star Ocean and Live A Live in the past couple of years, there’s still plenty of grist to this digital mill, so, we’ve had a good think, and come up with five other games that are begging for the HD-2D treatment.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VI</h2>
<p>With the producer of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake saying that he’d love to do this one next, it feels as though this is a thing waiting to happen. Final Fantasy VI is one of the most important releases in the franchise, its release on the SNES paving the way for many gamer’s induction into the series’ fandom, and putting in place some of the series most iconic characters, including the villainous Kefka,</p>



<p>VI was the last Final Fantasy to use a pixel art-style, but it benefits from the improvement in mechanics and storytelling over its predecessors. Sure, we’ve just had the pixel remasters to help preserve this in its original form, but surely this will be the next HD-2D game.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy Tactics</h2>
<p>Given that Square Enix ‘own’ the idea of the HD-2D remake, it makes sense to plough the Final Fantasy furrow further, and where better to take it than with Final Fantasy Tactics? In a sense, we’ve seen something of what it could look like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, but Final Fantasy Tactics has sat weirdly dormant amongst the catalogue despite being one of the most iconic and important releases in the Final Fantasy canon.</p>


<p>This strategy game’s in-depth job system, amazing tactical gameplay and memorable characters should surely set it out for a remake or remaster, and HD-2D seems like the perfect way to do that. There are already <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/the_recent_midori_leak_about_visions_of_mana/l8aa74v/">reports and rumours of a remake in the works</a>…</p>
<h2>Chrono Trigger</h2>
<p>Chrono Trigger was the first release in the Chrono series, and though it’s lain mostly dormant since the late 90s, Square Enix have rolled out steady re-releases of this game – heck, I can play it on my Apple TV. Its continued to garner interest because it remains an incredible JRPG, and features the work of a dream team of iconic Japanese creators, Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy series, Yuji Horii, creator of the Dragon Quest series and Akira Toriyama, character designer for Dragon Quest and author of both Dragon Ball and Sand Land. Add to that Takashi Tokita, Kazuhiko Aoki and Masato Kato, and this game’s development team was absolutely stacked.</p>

<p>It’s a literal powerhouse of a design team, and Chrono Trigger bears the hallmarks of all their input, with fantastic storytelling, enjoyable gameplay mechanics, and instantly recognisable characters. Much like Final Fantasy Tactics, it’s a series that’s mostly lain dormant, and is thoroughly ready for a return to our screens, not least because Live A Live had the HD-2D treatment a couple years ago.</p>
<h2>Xenogears</h2>
<p>This would be the pinnacle of HD-2D remakes, at least for me, as the foundation stone in the Xenosaga and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series. Originally released in 1998 on PlayStation, it’s strange that its never been returned to as it sits well within the canon of Square’s JRPG heyday.</p>

<p>There’s Active Time Battles, mecha suits, a storyline that draws on both Star Wars and the Bible, and an amazing soundtrack from Yasunori Mitsuda, and its just an incredible piece of RPG history. The fact that it already mixes 2D and 3D visuals means that, structurally at least, it would need less reworking than some of the other suggestions in this list.</p>
<p>It never reached Europe, so that lack of localisation is rumoured to play a major part in why it hasn’t returned. Surely though, the time is now, particularly with the Xenoblade Chronicles series riding high, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-removes-one-more-reason-to-keep-your-wii-u-in-march/">Chronicles X finding its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2025</a>.</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
<p>OK, we’re breaking out of Square Enix land for this one, but Nintendo has been one of their most reliable partners, the Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> founding the HD-2D style. Nintendo has traditionally been incredibly protective of their IP, but they’re less averse to partnering with other developers these days, and Square were the founding partners for Super Mario RPG and everything that came since. Sure, they went on a break over some CDs, but that’s ancient history now.</p>

<p>Alongside many other games on this list, The original The Legend of Zelda has been re-released across multiple generations of console, but it’s never been remade or remastered. Now, that could be because Nintendo feels its showing its age as a game, or that they just couldn’t settle on the right way to bring it back up to date. They could give it to Grezzo for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> treatment, but Square Enix’s HD-2D style feels like it would be a perfect match for the earliest Legend of Zelda game and its 8-bit visuals, and it could form an ideal window into the history of the series, while bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Anything from the Squeenix back catalogue</h2>
<p>Square Enix are always looking for an angle – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/square-enix-confirm-multiple-block-chain-games-in-development-rather-quieter-on-nfts/">like their whole NFT and blockchain nonsense</a> – but while remakes are the safe best, the hip and cool thing these days is actually the demake. Who’s to say that Square Enix couldn’t down-rez some of their more modern games and franchises?</p>

<p>As daft as this might sound, I do actually quite fancy blowing things up with a pixelated Rico Rodriguez in Just Cause HD-2D or some hack and slash pixelated action in Drakengard HD-2D? And while they might have sold off Crystal Dynamics, they kept a hold of their most important game series in the divorce. What about an HD-2D reworking of Gex after next year’s 3D re-release?!&nbsp;OK, maybe that’s a step too far. I should stop now before we revive the <a href="https://kaneandlynch.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_%26_Lynch:_Dead_Men_(Mobile)">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men mobile game</a>…</p>
<p>What other games would you like to see get the HD-2D treatment?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the earlier days of the internet, when social media wasn’t in everyone’s hands and gaming was niche and nerdy, some of the best video games were gatekept secrets and whispers on message boards. This rang particularly true for games from Japan or Europe, that often got overlooked by mainstream media. For years as a teen on the web, one game series in particular that felt like legend was STALKER. People would simply talk differently about these games, treating them like immersive experiences where you don’t just beat a level or complete a quest, you live in The Zone, and you become a Stalker. Now, with the first new entry in the series since 2009 and my first real foray into the franchise, I can tell you that all those stories were true. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is immersive, and frightening, and hilarious, and magical, and intense, and unlike pretty much anything else out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKO4PL8Xzik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> series owes its inspiration to societ scifi novel Roadside Picnic and the loosely related film adaptation by Andrei Tarkovsky. In the wake of 1986 Chornobyl nuclear reactor disaster, STALKER paints the picture of an alternate history where a 2nd disaster rocked the Exclusion Zone decades later in 2006. This has warped the entire region from a barely inhabitable wasteland to a truly alien world.</p>


<p>Mutated creatures stalk through the bushes, while sudden emission storms turn the sky and rip the earth apart. And then there are the anomalies – environmental oddities like psionic whirlwinds or chutes of fire that can shred you in an instant if you aren’t careful. Stalkers are dedicated wanderers and survivors who may not share ideals or allegiances, but all take part in overcoming the odds of The Zone to track down artefacts, make a little money, and strive to see another day.</p>


<p>This is all the narrative setup that truly matters to the overarching experience. In STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the game will attempt to paint you into the box of a man named Skif, who works as a Stalker to investigate the truth behind a unique artefact he uncovered after his old family home was destroyed. His story is fine, it’s okay, but what makes this game truly special is turning it into your own story, though. Like the freedom that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/19/review-fallout-new-vegas/">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> give you in crafting your own protagonist and filling the moments in-between dialogue with your own role-played lore, this game provides that same kind ofcanvas. However, you aren’t just painting it with dialogue options or character builds – your story is told through moments of survival.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is relentless, but combat is just one part of the tense tapestry it weaves. Gunfights can be fast and brutal. When you fight humans, they’re fragile, and so are you. A lined-up headshot can cause a bandit to crumble on the spot, but a bullet to your back can take you out just as quickly if you aren’t careful. Meanwhile, packs of dogs will upturn your plans at the worst possible time, every time. Mutated rats and invisible monsters will soak up your bullets and leave you drained of resources. Every moment of existing in The Zone is a calculated struggle, yet it never feels like an artificial challenge like so many other survival games do. You aren’t managing arbitrary hunger and thirst meters or idly gathering wood and stone – there is a constant direct connection between your survival needs and what is happening on-screen, and it is incredible.</p>

<p>As you learn what it takes to survive in The Zone, you’ll start to dig deeper into the overarching storyline of Heart of Chornobyl. While Skif’s personal journey is easy to ignore, there is a massive conflict brewing in the world between multiple factions that you quickly find yourself embroiled in – your choices on which sides to trust or not trust will leave a lasting impact on your playthrough. After one moment of siding with a group of Zone-revering Stalkers called Spark, I found myself in multiple situations where I would be attacked on-sight by their direct rivals, The Ward. On one of those occasions, though, a crew of Spark-affiliated Stalkers was nearby and helped me turn the tide on battle. Afterwards, I walked up to one of them, he offered to sell me items and boasted about “only having the good shit”, and I opened his inventory to see him selling two beers and a sausage. My man.</p>
<p>There’s an undercurrent of comedy to STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – the improvisational nature of the world and it’s inhabitants and how they all interact can toggle between frightening immersion and gut-busting hilarity in a moment. I love that, and I think we all need that. When you take into account the real-life circumstances faced by the Ukrainian development team behind this game, it’s easy to see how the unique charm of The Zone might be something that they really need right now, too.</p>

<p>Part of the comedy of errors that tends to play out in this game also comes from a litany of literal errors and bugs – the series’ reputation for being buggy continues. Some are hilarious visual oddities, like a mutated rat flying into the sky after I knifed it. Other bugs can be boring technical frustrations, though. Most of these bugs contributed to the charm of the world as I played the review build of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. A day one patch larger than the game itself arrived after I wrapped up my time with the game, and notes fixes many of these silly or frustrating bugs.</p>
<p>Even without those fixes, though, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is like almost nothing else out there. It’s full of charm in so many different flavors, and is a visual feast on top of that. It’s a new bold path for survival games and shooters that I never want to turn back from.</p>
