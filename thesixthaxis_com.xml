		<p>Warner Bros. Games has released an eight minute long video which delves into how Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has come to be, including the inspirations. There is also more footage from the game which shows the different eras players will go through, including young Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman, including his training with the League of Shadows.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Behind the Scenes - Building the Legacy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iB9SqHGitFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The video shows how every era of Batman has been used to create Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, including the movies, TV shows, and the comic archive. The developers also give a look at how iconic moments from across Batman’s history have been used to create the story and build the city of Gotham, with lots of familiar locations. The city will have a lot going on for players to discover including areas where crimes are happening that need to be thwarted. Batman is not the sole focus of the game, with the Bat Family and rogues gallery playing an incredibly important part in proceedings.</p>
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC.</p>

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast has to be the week’s biggest release, with zombie hunter Kyle Crane returning to parkour his way across an all-new open world, while bashing in the heads of the undead in a variety of grisly ways. While there have been a few reports of instabilities in the launch build, Techland have got right on it, and immediately dropped patch 1.2. Here’s what it fixes!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsqBCs7o5go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<li>Polished hit reaction transitions to remove janky interruptions.</li>
<li>Zombie “flavor” behaviors</li>

</ul>
<p>The team at Techland also let us know that there are going to be even more improvements made to the game over this weekend, and as soon as we have the details for that, we’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Gamoc is currently working through our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light: The Beast Review</a>, but his early impressions have been very good. He says, “It’s a return to the classic tone and style of Dying Light. This feels more like the truer sequel to Dying Light I was expecting, one that’s focused on the zombies and being terrifying instead of everything being about how humans are bad – we get enough of that in the real world these days. Dying Light: The Beast is tough and brutal whilst the suns up, and after sunset it’s just tension and terror. I’m not finished yet, but The Beast is mostly the game I wanted it to be.”</p>
