		<p>Sony is keeping the spooky season going with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for November 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, an anime spin-off and some toy car racing – this last one’s not horror…</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus November 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 5th November.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/"><strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/"><strong>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged</strong></a> (PS5|PS4)</li>
<li><strong>Death Note Killer Within</strong> (PS5|PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is in intriguing spooky time in Tokyo, with plenty of Japanese mythology fed into a first person action game.&nbsp;We scored in the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">8/10 in our review</a>, with Nick saying “Ghostwire: Tokyo was not the game I was expecting from Tango Gameworks, but I definitely enjoyed it. Blending magic-filled FPS action with Japanese mythology and an open world Tokyo that reminds me of the Yakuza series, it stands out from the crowd even if it’s not truly groundbreaking. Ghostwire has a lot of potential as a new franchise and I’m looking forward to seeing what Tango Gameworks does with it next.”</p>

<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo was one of the last Bethesda games signed to PlayStation exclusivity before Microsoft snapped up the publisher. Not only that, but it’s ended up being the penultimate game from Tango Gameworks before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/xbox-exec-tells-staff-they-want-more-smaller-games-just-like-hi-fi-rush-one-day-after-closing-its-studio/">Microsoft decided to close the company</a> – though it’s now been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">saved by Krafton</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside that is the high-octane arcade racing of Hot Wheels Unleashed 2, a souped up sequel that delighted Ade in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/">our review</a>. he said, “Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged is like Hot Wheels Unleashed, but better in every single conceivable way. Frenetically fluid and stonkingly fast, this is a quality arcade racer that will slap smiles on the faces of both young and old alike. Just don’t mention the single-player campaign.”</p>

<p>And the month is rounded out by Death Note Killer Within, a social deduction game based on the popular murder book anime series. With up to 10 players, you’ll be split into two teams with different objectives, either to eliminate L or seize the Death Note, while also trying to figure out everyone’s identities from varying roles and characteristics. That certainly sounds a lot like the high stakes intrigue of the source material!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
