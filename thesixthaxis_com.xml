		<p>Bandai Namco has released 10 minutes of footage for Elden Ring Nightreign, with this video’s aim being to give an overview of the game’s systems and characters. It goes over the world of Limveld, the characters you can choose from, and the new systems players will have to get to grips with that were not present in Elden Ring.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Limveld is not going to be a simple place to traverse. It is filled with powerful enemies, bases filled with soldiers, and random events that can change everything. Players can explore together in groups of three or choose to split up and cover more ground alone to learn the secrets of the land. There are dungeons filled with gear and treasure, while bases can hold information that will reveal more to you about the world. Do not expect the world to be static while you explore though. Every expedition sees the layout of Limveld change, with the landscape subject to change at a moment’s notice due to meteor strikes, lava eruptions, and the appearance of forests. At night, the play area gets smaller and smaller until you are cornered in to a small space where very powerful enemies stir. These battles are unavoidable so you need to spend the day maximising your exploration to level up and get the best gear.</p>
<p>In Elden Ring you could customise your character in a number of ways, but in Nightreign you choose from one of six heroes to play as. Raider is for those of you who like to wield big and powerful weapons, while Ironeye is an archer who can hit from range. Wylder is a character that is adept at all skills but master of none, perfect for those who don’t want to get locked into a specific way of play but it will take some time to master the skills he possesses. Guardian is a tank character that is able to withstand all kinds of attacks, including the most dangerous. Recluse wields cursed magic to attack her enemies, and Duchess is a character adept at dodging and striking quickly. Each character has their own story and their true identities will slowly be revealed as memory fragments are uncovered, which in turn will lead to new objectives to tackle.</p>
<p>When not out in the field fighting enemies, players can find some respite at the Roundtable Hold. The Roundtable Hold is where players can equip relics, with these having various effects on players from increasing stats to changing the impact of skills. You can also buy different items at the Roundtable Hold from a Jar mechant. There is also an area where new costumes can be unlocked using the game currency to change the appearance of your character.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on 30th May.</p>
