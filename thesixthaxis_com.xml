			<p>With the Switch 2’s launch came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">a new library of games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, Nintendo finally bringing GameCube games to the subscription service in a way that is honestly pretty great. And with a new generation of console has come a new generation of recreation controller from Nintendo, a thoroughly authentic GameCube controller that’s been updated and&nbsp;kitted out with direct support for the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>It honestly looks fantastic, a true GameCube controller in all its multi-coloured glory, and with modern innards it can be wireless without a double AA battery bay, and still have a thick rumble motor. Putting it side-by-side with an original controller, the sticks feel nigh on identical in use, there’s the same internal springy twang from the chunky analogue triggers, but there’s also the tightness of a new controller for things like the D-Pad (which is still small and impractical, but slightly less mushy). It’s very nice.</p>



<p>And for the GameCube library that will gradually grow on Switch Online, it’s perfect. It’s things like having analogue triggers for air braking in F-Zero GX, like having the Y button right next to A so you can boost without employing some bizarre claw grip on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> (or more likely modifying the button layout in the emulator).</p>
<p>But that’s its one and only real use on Nintendo Switch 2. Perhaps the most disappointing thing with this recreated GameCube controller is that controllers have moved on so much in the last 25 years. There’s a standardised form with triggers and shoulder buttons on both sides, with multiple menu and system buttons, with clicking analogue sticks… and the GameCube controller just cannot keep up without some hefty modification.</p>

<p>Nintendo goes halfway. There’s the Switch Home, Capture and the new C button, as well a sneaky little ZL button, all flush and colour matched on the top side of the controller where you can’t normally see them while playing.</p>

<p>That helps with using the Switch 2 system, but not far enough that this is universally compatible with modern games. So many games use stick clicks these days, and this would absolutely affect how the GameCube sticks feel were it implemented here. More annoying is that there’s no – button, which is so commonly used for a game menu or map alongside the + or Start button. That tiny ZL could easily have been made to match the Z button on the right side, as well. Additionally, outside of games that support a traditional game rumble – namely the Switch Online library and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate – the way that HD Rumble is transmitted to controllers is incompatible with this gamepad.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s just as Nintendo said it would be. This is almost exclusively useful for Nintendo Switch Online’s new library of GameCube games, where it will be the best way to play thanks to the quirky face button layout. It’s just less expected when the GameCube pad looks much more like a modern pad, compared to the funky tri-point N64 controller.</p>
<p>And that’s what dramatically shrinks the gamepad’s value, in my opinion. You can find cheap GameCube-like controllers from the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate craze that don’t adhere so strictly to the design and have all the system buttons. Sure, they’re bound to feel cheaper, they’re less accurate to the original design, but they also don’t cost £59, and can be used more properly for more Switch games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.</p>

		<p>The officially licensed EXG Pro Astro Bot Cable Guy will soon be available for pre-order, and it looks like a must-have for fans of Sony’s super-cute mascot.&nbsp; Designed to hold controllers, including the PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X|S controllers, and pretty much any mobile phone, Astro Bot can sit on your desk and be, well,&nbsp; super cute.</p>
<p>It’s also rather reasonably priced, considering the detail on the model and will cost you £29.99 plus postage.&nbsp; You can read more and get ready to pre-order over at <a href="https://exgpro.com/products/playstation-astro-bot-cable-guys-controller-holder-and-phone-stand?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3caf0d721&amp;_ss=r">EGXPro</a>.</p>




<p>Astro Bot will be getting a fresh update in July with free content.</p>

<p>“5 brand new levels will make their way into the game as part of the Vicious Void Galaxy, bringing the total number of levels in Astro Bot to a whopping 90+! As with our last update, these 5 levels will require you to pull every bit of skill together to complete so hang on to your DualSense Controller and dive in!” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">commented</a> Nicolas Doucet, Studio Head at Team Asobi.</p>
<p>“The 5 levels available will be:Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation and… well. You’ll have to play and see. And who knows? Maybe completing all Vicious Void might lead to something really cool?”</p>
<p>The levels will come with new collectable Special Bots including one that is a “revengeful newcomer”. Also, an updated version of the Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense wireless controller is launching later this year with a new twist on the touch pad.</p>
<p>Astro Bot cleaned up at this years<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/astro-bot-wins-five-baftas-still-wakes-the-deep-claims-three/"> BAFTA awards</a> winning five of the seventeen awards that were available.&nbsp; We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review,</a></p>
<p>“Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is. Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>
