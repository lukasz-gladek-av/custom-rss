		<p>Embark Studio has pushed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders </a>update 1.4.0 live, this smaller update focussed on content and bug fixes after the last two updates.</p>
<p>There’s some fixed lighting, a gun exploit that allowed it to be fixed more quickly by swapping to and fro, and they’ve ended an exploit that allowed all locked rooms to be opened.</p>


<p>Here’s the full ARC Raiders update 1.4.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.<wbr></li>
<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s much smaller than the last couple of updates, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/arc-raiders-update-1-2-0-is-called-north-line-adds-the-stella-montis-map/">1.2.0 adding the Stella Montis map</a> and a community challenge, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/arc-raiders-update-1-3-0-patch-notes-are-here-with-bug-fixes-and-balance-changes/">1.3.0 brought some balance tweaks</a> and had a more extensive set of bug fixes.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our review of ARC Raiders a few days ago. Tuffcub said, “Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</p>
