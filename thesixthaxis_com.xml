		<p>Is this the best start to a year in gaming we’ve ever had? It feels as though we’re seeing massive, hugely enjoyable games appear on the daily, and this week it’s been my pleasure to play through<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/"> Avowed</a>, an early highlight on the calendar for RPG fans. I’m also diving into the Elden Ring Nightreign network test which started today, had fun with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling</a>, and a bunch of other stuff I’m not allowed to talk about that totally don’t feature large creatures in them.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the prerequisite amount of Destiny 2, while also finding time to review <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/">Robobeat</a> which he grudgingly liked very much. <strong>Gamoc</strong>, meanwhile continued to tinker with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 after our review, reiterating that it’s excellent, as well as Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and a bit of Palworld.</p>
<p><strong>Aran </strong>has returned to us after an amazing trip to Japan, and he’s getting back up to speed by playing Citizen Sleeper 2 for review, while <strong>Jim</strong> finally saw the credits roll on Alan Wake 2. He told us, “I wasn’t too keen on the ending and felt like it meandered a bit too much without really offering anything diverse or satisfying with its combat gameplay. That said, I feel somewhat obliged to play through the DLC as it ties more into the wider Remedy universe.</p>
<p>“Not sure what my next game will be, either Plague Tale or Rise of the Ronin.” Any suggestions?</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a quieter week than normal, working his way through Gears of War 5. He says, “It’s fine but suffers from serious modern-day gaming bloat compared to the original trilogy. I’ve also been pottering through some indie games for review.”</p>
<p>Having seen off Unicorn Overlord, <strong>Ade</strong> has immediately made a tactical move to another Switch title, “I needed a game to fill the horned horse-shaped hole in my life, so, I’ve started Fire Emblem Engage! I’ve also enjoyed accidentally blowing up pals in Helldivers 2, solving physics-based puzzles in Immortals Rise of Fenyx, and watching Laura build uni halls in the hilarious Campus 2.0.”</p>

<p>Last, but never the least, <strong>Tef</strong> has also been playing Avowed to help produce <a href="https://youtu.be/_PCSaHYOKoY">our video review</a>, complimenting this with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">Killing Floor 3 for a preview</a> of the closed beta, and is just getting started with the technical test of Exoborne, where he’s roping Miguel and myself in for some exosuit extraction. There’s some other bits and bobs that he can’t talk about yet, though…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>
