		<p>Perhaps hoping to bury their bad news behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the GTA 6 delay</a>, Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed beyond its early 2026 window and has no new release date or window.</p>
<p>In a classic apology text image announcement thing – do these have a technical term? – &nbsp;<a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">the team writes</a>:</p>


<p>“At Skydance Games, our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and worlds we’re fortunate to work with. MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect.</p>
<p>“To fully realize our vision for MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses.”</p>

<p>It’s another significant setback to the Amy Hennig-led superhero game. Announced in March of last year, after originally been teased in 2021, the initial target was a &nbsp;2025 release… but outside of the cinematic reveal trailer last summer, we’ve heard and seen precious little about this game.</p>
<p>You’ve just got to hope they weren’t planning on a November 2026 release, because… that’d be a bit awkward now, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>The cast for the game includes Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>
