			<p>As a general rule, stealth games rely on the enemy AI to be total dunderheads. Gun-toting grunts can only search for an imposter for about thirty seconds before inexplicably stating, “Well, I guess they’ve gone,” before resuming their patrol without a care in the world. Even worse, what about all those times they find the dead corpse of one of their allies, search briefly for the culprit, before returning to their daily tasks, presumably then stepping over their dead colleague as they continue to meander around the place? It’s all very silly, and leads to the player – well, me at least – fundamentally not believing in the digital world they are inhabiting. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream smartly avoids every single one of these aforementioned issues and, in doing so, has become one of the genre-defining stealth games of this generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream | OFFICIAL DATE REVEAL TRAILER | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream doesn’t mess around when it comes to getting the player stuck into the action. A short, but brilliantly captured and performed cutscene introduces us to Hanna, a young orphan who has just recovered from a mysterious illness that is plaguing the citizens of Eriksholm. Her brother, Herman, has disappeared and the police, outlaws, slaves, and various other dubious factions are all after him. It’s up to Hanna to find her sibling and discover what he’s done to attract so much dangerous attention. She’ll do this by sneaking through a multitude of stealth-playgrounds; each contained – and beautifully rendered – environment is filled with foes to creep past and puzzles to solve. Played from a top-down isometric perspective, the first thing you’ll notice is that the AI you face isn’t made up of a collection of faceless idiots with the memories of a goldfish. Instead, these enemies feel like living, breathing beings, with their own agendas and concerns. Very cleverly, by listening into the conversations they have with one another, you’ll be able to put together a cunning plan to sneak past them.</p>


<p>As an early example of this, you’ll find two police officers patrolling in a loop, returning to their sergeant on a regular basis. Thing is, every time they return to their boss, the sergeant berates them. When the officers are on their own, they discuss how much they dislike the sergeant. So, you take out the sergeant with a sleeping dart and hide his body. When the officers return, they immediately notice and react to the fact that the sergeant is missing, should they go looking for him? “Nah” one of them remarks “he’s a pillock.” Then they just take the time to go and relax without their overbearing boss making their lives a misery. Rather than going back to their patrol like brainless morons, their understandable reaction feels real. It feeds back into the believability of Hanna’s surroundings, and there are numerous moments like this throughout the game, each of which makes you further invest in the characters and the world the developer has so meticulously built.</p>


<p>With such tight scripting, each location reacts and responds in an authentic way to your actions, which in turn enables the player to use that to their tactical advantage. A bunch of guards blocking your path? Take out one of them and the others will notice their missing comrade and go looking for them, allowing you to creep past. Just make sure you hid the body of their snoozing pal well, as it’s game over if you haven’t. In fact, it’s game over an awful lot in what can be a very challenging, but eminently fair, game.</p>
<p>The isometric viewpoint definitely helps with this, allowing you to assess everything going on around you, even if on occasion a big building or tree can briefly block your view. It would certainly be easy for the screen of Eriksholm to become very cluttered, covered with enemy view cones. Instead, view cones only appear when relevant, when your character gets near to an enemy who might spot them. When spotted, the controller rumbles to make you aware and an arrow points to you and slowly fills, giving you a brief opportunity to hide before you are discovered. Meanwhile, in darkness, your player character is highlighted to show they are hidden, a simple but highly effective means to avoid the annoyance of being unsure if the enemy can see you or not.</p>

<p>Precise timing is required to avoid patrols, with the correct approach often requiring trial and error to uncover. Thankfully, generous check points and rapid respawning negates any frustration, leaving you instead eager to give it another go, as you’re pretty sure, on this occasion, you’ve definitely cracked the stealth puzzle before you. Certain challenges really ramp up the pulse-pounding tension. One set-piece moment that stands out in the memory takes place whilst Hanna is hiding in a carriage as police search along the train. The player must observe the environment, noting the movements of all the enemies to spot one brief moment in which they can make their desperate escape. Thrilling stuff!</p>
<p>Wonderfully, the game gradually builds this complexity, rather than overwhelming the player from the start, introducing new mechanics during each stage to keep things fresh. Soon you’ll be balancing the abilities of several player characters, using one to disturb some pigeons to distract the nearby guards and allow your ally to sneak past, as well as utilising shadows and several new special abilities to your advantage. Every time you think you have the measure of Erikshom, it throws new ideas your way to keep you hooked.</p>

<p>Visually, Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is gorgeous, like a sublime and intricate painting, the level of detail that suffuses each area is something to behold. Despite the majority of the game taking place in a city, there’s a huge variety of locations to explore to, from slums to underground mines, shipyards, prisons, and fortresses. Voice acting and scripting is top-notch throughout, creating eminently believably personalities.</p>
<p>Even if all you can see of them is the top of their head and shoulders, each person you encounter is presented like a fully rounded character. The plot is brilliant, both engaging and well-paced, I found myself totally involved in Hanna’s plight from beginning to end. Indeed, clocking in at around twelve hours, Eriksholm isn’t a big game, but it is a near-perfect one. With content that is all killer, this is a compelling experience welcomingly free of the pointless busy-work that pads out many games.</p>

		<p>Reigns of Ruin: Runegate answers the question “What if it was Stargate, but it’s dwarves, and fighting against goblins instead of humans with worms living in their tummies?” This game tasks you with stepping through the titular portal in an effort to re-establish a sanctuary for dwarven civilisation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What that looks like is a side-scrolling hack and slash RPG where you travel to micro levels, battle baddies and gradually build up your home base to further your adventuring options.</p>


<p>It starts, though, with fleeing from the goblins that threaten the last vestiges of the stronghold that you canonically built in the original Regions of Ruin. At the last possible moment, you run through the portal opened in the Runegate and arrive at what will be your new home, an abandoned, crumbling underground city that will be your task to restore and repopulate.</p>
<p>And so it’s time to step through the Runegate time and again, venturing to other planes to gather resources, convince other dwarves to join your cause, and battling the forces of evil that you might encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Though certainly still in keeping with the original game, there’s a good step forward for the visual style of Runegate. It’s still got a low-resolution pixel art style, there’s still this flattened parallax tone, but there’s also just a lot more finesse to the character designs, the scenery you’re running through, everything. It’s much more in keeping with better examples of this art style, such as its Raw Fury stablemate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/07/kingdom-two-crowns-review/">Kingdom Two Crowns</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring each realm has a pleasing feel to it, as you’re presented with a world map that you need to fill in. From the revealed land around the Runegate, you can reveal another path of land and reveal points of interest to visit, so long as you have enough food supplies to meet the one-time cost that it takes to get there. You could immediately travel to the farthest flung reaches of the map, if you had enough food, but really the game’s intention is that you’ll start local and branch out from there, following narrative and mission threads as you go.</p>
<p>Happening on a dwarven settlement in a dank-looking cave and talking to its people, they initially seem reticent to come and join your small group on the other side of the Runegate. But if you prove yourself by, for example, clearing out a bunch of goblins, battling packs of wild wolves, reuniting lost brothers, then they’ll consider it more seriously. That then means heading back to the world map, maybe paying the fee to explore a nearby patch of darkness and reveal new locations to venture to. You’ll rarely know exactly what to expect, but odds are there will be someone or something to fight.</p>
<p>This is where we come to the meat and potatoes of an action RPG. As a side-scrolling game, there’s only so many ways that combat can really unfold. You can attack with your equipped weapon (whether it’s one or two handed), block if you have a shield, wind up to fire a crossbow or throw a javelin, and dodge. You can boost your abilities by levelling up stats in Combat, Defence, Ranged and Rogueish attributes, and you might gravitate toward a particular style and type of weapon – I quite liked the standard axe and shield, after sending an opening crossbow bolt at any enemies.</p>

<p>Avoiding damage is rather tricky when attacks from onrushing melee assailants and more distant archers come quick and fast, but the pace of combat means you can clobber your way through. It also helps that you can have allies alongside to take some of the aggression.</p>
<p>Once any battle is done and dusted, then comes the time to smash everything in sight to pieces and gather up the resources they provide. You’ll need things like wood or stone for when you travel back through the Runegate to your home base and get to fixing up the joint. There’s crumbled bridges to repair, there’s marketplaces to rebuild, people to talk to for more missions, and more.</p>

<p>There’s a potentially rather moreish gameplay loop to discover here, the snackable combat going hand-in-hand with exploration and base building. What’s especially nice is how little stories and ideas can unfold, like finding a captive and releasing them before you’ve been asked to, just because you stumbled across the goblins first, or thinking it a good idea to release a caged wolf… who seems to blame you for their captivity. Thankfully not all wolves are immediately hostile. In fact, we stumbled across one rather eerie area with just a large pack of wolves seemingly standing guard, and one of them with whom we could engage, giving food until they let us pet them and actually recruit them as a battle companion.</p>
<p>Also, when you drink a stein of beer, you raise your other weapon-holding hand while necking it, and then smash the glass on the floor. Classic dwarves.</p>
