		<p>The Sinking City Remastered has been given a surprise launch by Frogwares, who have made the game available today for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/31/the-sinking-city-remastered-announced/">The Sinking City Remastered&nbsp;</a>was announced at the end of March, along with confirmation that owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S would get this upgrade for free.</p>

<p><em>”We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em>”, said Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares.</p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game remade in Unreal Engine 5, adding enhanced details to environments and objects. The game has 4K textures and an added photo mode so you can zoom in and check the details for yourself. There is also support f<span>or DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling, as well as new accessibility options.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em>&nbsp;“The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2</a> was announced last year with a release window of 2025, with some funding coming from a Kickstarter. The final amount raised in the Kickstarter was 553,100 euros, way above the target of 100,000 euros.</p>
