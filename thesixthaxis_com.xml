		<p>EA and Full Circle have confirmed that Skate will be entering early access on September 16th, with the game available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One. The game will be free to play and feature both cross platform progression and cross platform play.</p>

<p><em>“Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;skate.,”</em> said Jeff Seamster, Head of Creative on Skate<i>.</i><em> “From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community – listening, learning and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in,&nbsp;skate.&nbsp;is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers – just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</em></p>
<p>In Skate, players will be able to roll, grind, and ollie around the city of San Vansterdam which will be a large open world, with plenty of places to pull of tricks. San Vansterdam is split into four different neighbourhoods which are Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich. Each area has its own challenges and unique designs. To pull off various moves, the Flick-It system is going to be the key as it will be offering precision and control. New tricks are being added to Skate as well, and these are wallies, slappies and firecrackers. Additional features like Quick Drop will allow players to add ramps and rails to areas, allowing customisation that will allow refreshing of areas.</p>

		<p>Here is a blast from the past! Acclaim has announced that it will be revealing details about new games including exclusives on September 10th. It seems very much that Acclaim has some projects already signed up but has opened pitches for developers to reach out to the company with their games for the chance to get Acclaim as their publisher.</p>
<p><iframe title="#PlayAcclaim Transmission Received: A New Era is Coming" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>According to the official website, <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">PlayAcclaim</a>, this iteration of Acclaim, <em>“is founded by a passionate team of industry veterans with a focus on empowering developers and creators to bring their games to the widest possible audience. We provide funding and publishing services to video game developers, including production, PR/marketing support, distribution and more.”</em></p>
<p>Acclaim was a massive publisher from the late 80s through to the early 2000s, with games including The Punisher, The Simpsons: Bart vs the Space Mutants, WWF Royal Rumble, Mortal Kombat, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and South Park. We do not know what games this new Acclaim will be bringing, so we will find out on September 10th.</p>
