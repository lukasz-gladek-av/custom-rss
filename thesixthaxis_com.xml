		<p>Five years on from the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, IO Interactive has announced yet another impactful update and feature for their World of Assassination trilogy. Along with an overhauled IOI Account system, cross-progression will be added to Hitman WOA, letting you take your progress with your between platforms and storefronts.</p>
<p>Going live on 3rd February, enabling cross-progression will ask you to link platforms to your IOI Account and then choose one platform profile to become your primary account. All other linked platforms will then defer to this primary account, instead of having progress and achievements merged. It’s a shame, but it is understandable given the potential for problems that this would introduce.</p>


<p>The following progression data is shared across platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li data-list-item-id="ee883927197eb6b916f2a2ae0d01c6e6b"><strong>Experience</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e9a47b05ccaa834fe2831a9defbc15d13"><strong>Player Level</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e0c64bac2284521f595e3c0851665fc63"><strong>Challenges</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="eea2562a514f6a86df7d818fc8c4965f2"><strong>Location&nbsp;Mastery</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e8c75d381f57c0f39239f67a720626804"><strong>Unlocks&nbsp;and Inventory</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e99a35d8f441abc9ae2fdedbe00ca4e49"><strong>Achievements&nbsp;/&nbsp;Trophies</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="eeb408de67adb90ae6437e6603416ad47"><strong>Freelancer Mode Progression</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="ed0661519f1cc30d5c6f6892ac1f81ed2"><strong>Campaign&nbsp;Story Progress</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that are not shared between platforms are any kind of purchases – game license, DLC license, and DLC-based unlocks – leaderboard scores and level saves (either offline or online). This means that, if you want to play some DLC levels on a system where you haven’t bought it, then you can’t.</p>
<p>The other major caveat is that the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 progression carryover will now come to an end on 3rd February. This was created to enable the importing of Hitman 2 game progression into its sequel, but with this now being half a decade old compared to WOA, and again wanting to keep data integrity and prevent issues and conflicts, IO is bringing it to an end. You still have two weeks <a href="https://profile.hitman.com/">to do so here</a>.</p>

<p>For more details on everything this means for the game, head to <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">IO Interactive’s FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>In general, this is pretty great news. Again, it’s a shame that you can’t merge progression somehow, as my personal playtime has be spread across multiple systems, but the bulk of my time has been on PlayStation, so I can forego the loss.</p>
<p>Hitman 3 first launched back in early 2021, a concluding chapter to the ambitious trilogy that IO Interactive had started five years previous. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 review</a>, Jim said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>
