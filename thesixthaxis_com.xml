		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>

		<p>There’s tons of big games arriving a moment to appeal to all sorts of gamers, whether it’s Ghost of Yotei’s launch for PlayStation fans this week, picking up on the excellent Hades 2 from last week, celebrating Mario’s 40th with the Galaxy and Galaxy 2 remaster, or hopping into shooty bang bang stuff with the Black Ops 7 beta, just ahead of next week’s Battlefield 6 launch.</p>
<p>It’s quite the time, and I’ve been playing some of these headline-grabbing games this past week!</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> jumped between two strikingly different games, with his review of the sportball-filled EA Sports FC 26 and the toon-filled action RPG Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny. Another huge shift comes with Jim’s gaming, who wrapped up a review of UBOAT, which put him in command of a German submarine during WW2 –&nbsp;“It’s a fascinating sim though one that comes with a steep learning curve, requiring patience and attention to detail.” He’s now moving on to Ghost of Yotei and the Black Ops 7 beta for this weekend’s gaming action.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hoovering up slime poops otherwise known as “plorts”, and then selling them for cold hard cash and upgrades in Slime Rancher 2. She’s also been “finding every opportunity to launch myself across the screen”, while playing Absolum for review alongside <strong>Ade</strong>. Her other half has added Marvel Rivals and Hades 2 alongside that, the latter of which he reckons is both bigger and better than the original.</p>


<p><strong>Jason</strong> thoroughly enjoyed his time reviewing Digimon Story Time Stranger –&nbsp;why did they ditch the colon for the middle of that game name? I don’t know –&nbsp;and has also falledn back into Vampire Survivors to go along with more lootering and shootering in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It was a big bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics this past week for <strong>Nic</strong>, but he has also been jumping into a different tactical game for review, and is looking forward to telling everyone a bit more. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got a few hours in with Robocop: Rogue City Unfinished Business and finds it still to be both very enjoyable and old fashioned. “You don’t need to think too much,” he said, “it’s just reactions and exploding heads, and sometimes that’s all you need.”</p>

<p>While he continues his recovery, <strong>Steve</strong> has been building up his gaming stamina with a little bit of Silent Hill f, “which is brilliantly atmospheric”. He also finished Breath of Fire II and made a start on III, which is tickling the nostalgia bits of his brain.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom</strong> returned to the UK and has been playing a bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics for himself, mixing in some NBA 2K26 and Madden 26, and making a start on Hades 2!</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Party Review]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The LEGO franchise has tried its tiny-clawed plastic hand at nearly every video game genre going. We’ve had platformers, shoot ‘em ups, racers, co-op adventures, puzzlers, even a Super Smash Bros. clone. But, rather oddly, never a party game. That’s where LEGO Party comes in, offering fun, frolics and laughter for all the family across its impressive range of silly yet satisfying mini games.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Party! Launch Trailer – Endless Minigames &amp; Laughs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Sw1AYmz6CA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, Lego Party looks great. The mini-figs gleam with personality and exude charm, flinging their way through each challenge with wanton abandon. Even better, your Lego dude can be customised to a ridiculous degree. Once you’ve unlocked a few new body parts by playing the game, you’ll soon be able to build the over-the-top Frankenstein Pirate-Ninjago-Knight character of your dreams.</p>


<p>Once you and your gang have chosen your avatars, you pick a themed board game to travel around and undertake your challenges. With Pirates, Ninjas, Knights, and Space to choose from, each board is stuffed with iconic characters. There really is something for every Lego fan here.</p>
<p>The four-player minigames themselves really are a Lego-cised who’s who of classic co-op and party video games of yesteryear. There’s a Trials-style race that sees you and your rivals attempt to navigate a 2D level perched atop motorbikes that hate gravity. There’s a Flappy Birds-like game, a Micro Machines imitator, one that emulates Katamari Damacy but with Lego-brick collecting, and a rope-swinging challenge that brings to mind Speed Runners. As a gamer of some thirty-five years, these mini-games come across as derivative – though irresistibly fun – but to new or young gamers, the selection of mini-games on offer are a constant source of new ideas, though smartly grounded in proven mechanics.</p>


<p>Where Lego Party truly succeeds is when it leans into mini-games that are discernibly Lego-y. Indeed, they can only exist because the game is built from Lego pieces. Activities in which you must decipher a Lego instruction manual, build your own monsters, or discern which selection of bricks built which model are a highlight and offer something entirely original, even to players who have been brought up on Mario Party over numerous iterations.</p>
<p>The pace of the game is blistering, hurtling you from challenge to challenge with a pace akin to WarioWare Inc. more than his party-flinging nemesis. As such, even for younger players there’s no opportunity to get bored, as you are always whisked onto the next thing. More importantly, there’s a high degree of accessibility, perfect for players of varying abilities. Controls are simple, responsive, and well implemented, plus, there’s a nice balance of luck-based and skill-based challenges, ensuring that everyone has a chance of winning and – hopefully – avoiding any potential tantrums from child – and adult, sorry everyone – alike. Basically, anyone, even those who’ve never played a video game before, can have a blast with Lego Party.</p>
<p>Where the game truly delivers though, is in its slick game show presentation. Normally, in-game commentators commenting on the action are acutely annoying, here, they are frankly hilarious. Thanks to reams and reams of available dialogue, Paige and Ted rarely repeat themselves whilst delivering gag after gag. Sure, not all of them land, but when you are regularly setting the whole family off in fits of hysterics, you know you are doing something right. The entire game is imbued with this comic energy, reminiscent of the style so iconically established with The Lego Movie. The slapstick visuals delight throughout, feeling like you are playing Lego with a particularly energetic and imaginative child, as Lego figures are hurtled across the screen, builds are constructed and then pulled apart, and everyone seems to be dressed as a banana or pizza slice.</p>

<p>The game is oddly slight in places. Sixty minigames might sound a lot, but once you’ve seen them all – which won’t take long – it’s remarkable how quickly a sense of repetition sets in. Sometimes the game is too chaotic, leading to players losing track of what’s going on, either in the minigames themselves or as they clamber across the board game section. But frankly, isn’t that all part of the party game experience?</p>
<p>Playing online or in single player this constant bonkers over-the-top energy can feel oddly flat, but in local play with friends or family this is an utterly magical experience. Sure, it would have been nice to have the inclusion of Harry Potter, Marvel, DC, or Star Wars to pad out the game, but with licencing that complex, perhaps we’ll have to wait for the sequel. But with a party game this good on its first outing, I’ve no doubt we’ll get one.</p>
