		<p>We’re just a week away from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">the big Nintendo Direct Switch 2 reveal</a> on 2nd April, but Nintendo has decided to host <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct this week. Tomorrow, in fact. There’s around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch, but the company explicitly states, “<span>There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.”</span></p>
<p>It’s broadcasting on 27th March at 2PM UK time – that’s 7AM PDT, 10AM EDT, 2PM GMT, 3PM CET, since we’re in that funny period where the US is already on daylight savings.</p>


<p>And you can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025 – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9OqoRxXUjGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What kind of games will be shown tomorrow? Well, Nintendo just say that they’re upcoming titles, so it’s not specifically a first party stream, or an indie-focussed one, and so we could see a wide mix of new announcements and updates on existing projects from third parties. We’d expect Nintendo to be keeping their cards close to their vest, considering that Switch 2 will be the big talking point next week, though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/nintendo-finally-confirms-switch-2-backward-compatibility/">everything will also be playable with a Nintendo Switch 2 via backward compatibility</a>.</p>

<p>After literally years of rumours and build up, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> finally arrived back in January. It was a pretty abstract and brief look at the console hardware, showing lots of points of comparison for how the design has changed compared to the original Switch. It showed the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>But the real highlight was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>, and we expect to see a lot more of that next week during the Nintendo Direct, in addition to seeing some more first party games, and details on pricing and release date. That’s all leading into a string of hands-on preview events around the world through April and May, and we can’t wait to go hands on.</p>
