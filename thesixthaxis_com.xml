		<p>Project Cloud Games and Perp Games have confirmed that the action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/watch-over-eight-minutes-of-the-relic-first-guardian-gameplay/">The Relic: First Guardian gameplay</a> will be launching on May 26th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To announce this release date, a new trailer has been released which appears to show another boss that players will have to try and take on as they try to piece together The Relic: First Guardian’s story.</p>

<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void, with the hope being that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void.</p>
<p>Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes and items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. Every single weapon, of which there are five types, and armour piece is unique with each one having its own story behind it, along with a specific vow that the previous owner made. These pieces can be found and used against the 70 bosses that make up the challenge of The Relic: First Guardian, with each again having its own unique backstory. Players will also have access to 12 skill trees allowing for a range of playstyles.</p>

		<p>A new update for RV There Yet? has been released by developer Nuggets Entertainment, adding the new location of Mt. Yurbuttsk. This new stop on the RV route allows players to get a spot of skiing in to relax during the winter months. That is all that has been added in this update with new animals, snowball fights, new tools, and new music. Nuggets Entertainment is also trialing localisation with this update for RV There Yet?, though most of this is concentrated in the Mabutts Valley.</p>

<p>RV There Yet? is a co-op game where players are travelling in their RV back from a vacation, but run into all sorts of issues on Route 65. Players need to find ways to survive this route and get their RV across challenge terrain, sometimes needing to winch it or jump it across gaps and up heights when there is road to follow. The RV does get damaged so finding scrap in the wild is also essential to keep it moving, lest you get trapped on Route 65 and never make it home.</p>
