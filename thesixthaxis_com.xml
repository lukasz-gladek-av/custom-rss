			<p>From the opening strains of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s beautiful title track, it’s clear that this is an RPG that’s embracing its own sense of style. With French-language vocals and sweeping orchestration, it sets a tone for a game that feels unequivocally French. When you see the twisted remains of Paris, you’ll understand why.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsElVZ0sLtU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur begins in Lumiere, a city set within a fantastical interpretation of France. In this world, the oldest members of society die out, erased by the Paintress, who paints a number on her cursed monolith once a year, erasing everyone of that age. Each year, that number gets lower, slowly but surely edging towards zero. Clair Obscur opens with you bidding farewell to those aged 34, your love amongst them. Gustave, our central character, voiced by Daredevil star Charlie Cox, sets out as part of Expedition 33, a group dedicating the final year of their life to trying to combat this inevitable destruction of the human race, fighting back against the Paintress and her inexplicable taste for number-based death.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur is simply stunning. You should check out one of the game’s early trailers to get a true sense of it, but the team at Sandfall Interactive have captured the fantastical and the unlikely in a way that feels genuinely unique. Sunlight reflects off the dust particles floating through the air, the landscape shifts and shimmers while mist caresses your character. Looking upwards, though, it becomes clear that this is a broken land, with floating rocks and giant growths filling the purple-hued skyline. Beneath it, you soon find the ugly side of this world, coming across the remains of your Expedition, routed beneath the enemy’s banners.</p>


<p>Gustave takes this poorly, sitting amongst the fallen bodies of his bodies and manifesting a pistol that he holds to his own temple. It’s only the interjection of teammate Lune that stops him from joining them. There’s a close-run vein of darkness and depression that Clair Obscur looks to plough, and Cox’s delivery only heightens the sense of pain and loss that lies at the game’s heart. You can expect the drama and emotion to be maximised by the stellar voice cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and Final Fantasy XVI’s Ben Starr, and I found myself hanging on every word of dialogue during the preview.</p>
<p>The Expedition’s health and safety is at the centre of your experience. You can heal the entire group using Chroma Elixirs, as well as keep a watchful eye over the Expedition’s status and key objectives at any time, and this plays into the idea that this quest isn’t just about one person, it’s for every remaining member of the human race.</p>

<p>Combat is played out via turn-based battles, and the same attention to visual design found in the environment has made its way into these encounters. The UI experience has to be the most stylish we’ve seen since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio’s</a>, with your battle wheel letting you access Attacks, Skills, and Items, all of which you’ll need to utilise to prevail against Clair Obscur’s fantastical enemies.</p>
<p>There’s an active element to these turns, though, where pressing the dodge button at the right time might see you escape from damage. If you time it at the last moment, you’ll gain a Perfect Dodge and earn additional charges on your Overcharge Meter.</p>
<p>That Overcharge Meter lets you perform your most powerful attacks, and here too Clair Obscur wants you to be involved, giving Skills extra damage if you successfully time the right button press with your attack. You might wonder about the return of QTEs, or hark back to your favourite Mario RPGs, but they serve to keep you on your toes, unable to look away for a moment.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Parrying, which rather than getting you out of the way, sees you hitting a smaller window of opportunity to repel enemy attacks. If you’re able to successfully Parry multiple attacks in a row, you can answer back with a devastating counter. Parrying feels excellent here, maybe even a little overpowered, but successfully pulling one off gives you a shot of endorphins that most turn-based RPGs can only dream of.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Clair Obscur doesn’t want players to be passive observers during its turn-based battling, and it feels closer to an action title than many other RPGs. You have to be well prepared and engaged if you want to get the most out of it, getting your party through encounters in the quickest time possible, while incurring the least damage.</p>
<p>Giving you something else to think about, some characters can inflict Stains on enemies. These elemental marks can cause additional damage if you’re thoughtful about the order in which you attack, and single attacks might produce multiple effects. Lune’s Ice Lance skill inflicts both an Ice Stain and a Light Stain, and you can then consume them with opposing skills, such as a Fire Skill like Immolation. These also play into Elemental Affinities, and while some might cause additional damage, you might heal enemies if you choose the wrong one.</p>
<p>Tonally, there are aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that remind me of Eternal Sonata, the JRPG set within the dying mind of Frederic Chopin. There’s the same quiet sense of the inevitable that creeps into every moment here, while the exquisite orchestration brings both melancholy and grandeur to the incredible events. There’s a darkness here that’s utterly unmatched, and while some might find the atmosphere oppressive, there’s a kernel of hope to wrap yourself around.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to juggle in Clair Obscur’s combat systems, and I came away from our preview thoroughly invested in the world and its turn-based action. For fans of role-playing games, this is one Expedition you don’t want to miss.</p>

		<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit and a huge-seller, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchises fortunes are Kalypso Media, who purchased Commandos back in 2020 and immediately announced a completely new entry in the series. That game, Commandos: Origins, is fast-approaching release. Developed by Claymore Game Studios, we were lucky enough to be invited to see some new gameplay and, boy-oh-boy, based on current evidence Commandos fans are in for a treat; Commandos Origins looks excellent!</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting in an Allied Prison, deep in Africa, the demo immediately introduces us to the Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the Prison complex, each utilising their unique abilities to help the other to their objective. The stealth mechanics appear reliable and accessible, with obvious viewing cones showing what your foes can see, allowing the Commandos to slip past unnoticed. The game even depicts visual sound waves, so you know exactly who will be alerted if you opt for a noisy takedown.</p>
<p>So far, so prescriptive stealth game. Things get way more interesting when the Germans invade the prison. Tanks smash through walls, soldiers shoot it out on the streets, and captured Allied soldiers are held at gunpoint; rather than escape, it’s up to the Commandos to save their comrades. Suddenly, the game becomes open and free-form, numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves. Do you sneak past the tank, then double back to destroy it with a bomb? Perhaps knocking some loose masonry on an unsuspecting Nazi’s head is the way to go? Maybe you should help a squad of Allied soldiers pinned down by taking out a sniper for them? Or just pull out your machine gun and go wild? Possible strategies are interesting and varied, and many objectives, it seems, are entirely optional.</p>


<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters with smooth animation crawling through debris, kicking down doors, or garrotting Nazis. Talking of successfully garrotting Nazis, you can pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly conceived plan carried out to, well, perfection. In a later snow-covered level, we see the Sniper eliminate a German Official, whilst the iconic radio left by the Green Beret lures another solider to their doom; all carried out with precise military efficiency.</p>
<p>Levels in general are going to be humongous, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Indeed, we are promised levels that take several hours to fully complete (and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters). There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, as we see the Green Beret clamber across a telephone wire to sneak past an electrified fence; how such a thin wire could support the weight of this hunk of man is beyond us, but he certainly looked cool doing it.</p>
<p>All of the iconic Commandos return, a highlight seems to be the spy, who can impersonate German Offices – and other characters – to move freely round the map. Though the Driver promises to provide much merriment, thanks to his ability to take control of German hardware, so surely blowing up some troopers with their own Panzer will be an option?</p>

<p>To our mind, the only question mark remains the quality of the controls on console. When quizzed on how they approached implementing the controller into a game that is best suited for mouse and keyboard, Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director of Claymore Game Studios, stated that there were challenges but remained tight-lipped over the solution.</p>
<p>Still, there was plenty of Commandos brilliance on display in our all too brief time checking out the game, leaving us salivating for the chance to try Commandos: Origins ourselves. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/commandos-origins-gets-a-sneaky-april-release-date/">the game launching on 9th April</a>, we don’t have long to wait to do so.</p>
