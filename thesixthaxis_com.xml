		<p>Tron: Catalyst, the new game from Bithell Games, publisher Big Fan and Disney, has a release date, this digital world thriller coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and PC on 17th June 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDRwx2qK-74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer gave us a closer look at Exo, the game’s protagonist, who’s found herself with the cursed gift of being able to perceive the glitch that is affecting the Arq Grid, letting her loop time back around on itself, and lending her unique abilities in combat. Glitches will allow you the ability to roll back time, rewinding events and using time loops that only you can see to uncover secret areas and shortcuts, as well as manipulate the factions in the game’s story.</p>
<p>It’s a Bithell game, so you know that one of the strengths is going to be the narrative – the studio previously explored the setting with the well-received Tron: Identity visual novel – though they’re getting back to creating something a bit more action-oriented. There’s various factions looking to hunt Exo down, such as the Peacekeepers and the malevolent prgram Conn, both of which are hot on Exo’s heels throughout.</p>

<p>And it wouldn’t be a Tron game without a bit of Light Cycle action, would it? The demo shows off some Light Cycle exploration in the city of Vertical Slice.</p>

		<p>Digital Sun dropped a new trailer and a new announcement for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault last night, showing off more of the game, and confirming that it will launch day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> when it arrives for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | A New Journey Unfolds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slC6c8E40-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money selling his finds. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Where is Tresna, though? Well, it’s where Will and his companions have found themselves trapped in a dimension far from home. The ultimate goal of the game is to find a way to get back.</p>
<p>Moonlighter 2 builds on the same two-sided game design of the original, managing and curating a shop during the day and then adventuring at night. It jumps beyond the original game with a new full 3D isometric look, with the new trailer showing both the new hometown and shop that you’ll need to keep stocked with sellable goodies.</p>
<p>There’s an exapnded arsenal of weapons and gear to use when adventuring, as well as a fresh batch of biomes to battle through and enemies to overcome.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter review</a> from back in 2018 – it’s been that long?! – Jason said, “Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</p>
