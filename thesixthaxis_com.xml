		<p>GFAGames has announced that it will be launching an open beta for the open world MMO FPS PIONER on November 4th, giving players the chance to check out the game world. PIONER has both PvE and PvP gameplay, and it looks like players will be free to choose which side of the game they want to interact more with.</p>

<p>PIONER’s description says, <em>“PIONER is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.”</em></p>
<p>On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. To survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. There will be a crafting element to the game allowing players to create weapons and equipment to use in both PvE and PvP. Additionally, there are a number of different factions within the world, and building up a reputation with each will also give new items and missions.</p>

<p>GFAGames is targeting this year to fully release PIONER, but it is likely that will be looking at feedback from the open beta before committing to a solid release date for the full game. PIONER is currently confirmed for PC.</p>
