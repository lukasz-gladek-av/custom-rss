		<p>Publisher No More Robots has announced two new games during an eighth anniversary showcase, with these games being pretty different to each other. The first is Cruise Control, a game about managing a cruise fleet, while the second game is about job applications and the job market. That game is called Thank You For Your Application, a phrase surely burnt into the mind of anyone who has applied for jobs.</p>

<p>In Cruise Control, your role is to build up a cruise ship, expanding its offerings, and keeping cruise enthusiasts happy. You will need to fill the ship with amenities like restaurants and gyms, plus entertainment rooms such as bingo halls, dance halls, arcades, spas, gaming halls, and cinemas. The more popular your cruise gets, the more people that will want to set sail with you so you will need to keep expanding and refreshing those offerings. A ship needs a crew though, so you will need to hire maintenance staff to keep the ship going smoothly and keeping it tidy. Cruise Control will also feature an Elite Cruises mode where you will compete with other players to climb the leaderboard. A beta test will be taking place soon, and to join you have to go the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fx82V8Tn7eM">Cruise Control Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Thank You For Your Application looks like a game that fans of Papers, Please will be interested in. You play as a junior interviewer for Aeropolis, the biggest company in the world. Your role is to interview candidates and send thank you letters, but there is a secret to uncover too. There will be lots of interviews to do, and robots are also eligible to take jobs from humans. You will earn money but will need to be on top of things like rent, so you do not become an illegal resident. Thank You For Your Application has a branching narrative which is affected by the choices you make, and you can try out a demo for the game now by going to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881370/Thank_You_For_Your_Application/">Steam page</a>.</p>
