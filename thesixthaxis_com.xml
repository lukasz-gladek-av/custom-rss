		<p>Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced that their cooperative heisting sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monaco-2">Monaco 2</a> will release on 10th April for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monaco 2- Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsfJzrKRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monaco 2 invites you to play with heisting teams of up to four players – you can, of course, tackle missions solo as well – and picking from eight playable characters. You can switch mid-run if the obstacles before you don’t meet your character’s skill set, but you can preview a mission’s layout with the Blueprint Mode before you set foor in a stage.</p>
<p>Where the original Monaco was a linear adventure, in which you assembled a crew of misfits to pull off an audacious series of heists and capers, the sequel is taking a different tack. While there is a structured campaign, this is going down the path of a more freeform heist simulator, testing you and your co-op buddies through procedurally generated levels that have been cooked up by an AI mastermind.</p>
<p>After the minimalist top-down shenanigans of the original, Monaco 2 is much more fleshed out visually with an isometric view into 3D worlds and a painterly art style. It looks rather lovely.</p>

<p>A demo of Monaco 2 was released back in February for Steam Next Fest. The demo features around 2 hours of missions that present their own unique challenges, picking from the line up of five of the thieves from the full game. The demo also featured a mode called “Unreliable Narrator”, which scrambles up the missions in interesting ways.</p>
