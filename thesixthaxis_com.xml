		<p>EA has taken a slightly different approach this year for its EA Sports FC 26 reveal trailer. Instead of just having footballers running around and playing the beautiful game, this reveal trailer addresses player complaints about the previous entries to the series and how FC 26 is looking to improve them. Of course, there are still the big name stars present in the trailer including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Jude Bellingham, and Jamal Musiala.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,”</em> said John Shepherd, VP &amp; GM, EA SPORTS FC. <em>“We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these changes coming to EA Sports FC 26 a bit more, beginning with the Archetypes system. The Archetypes system will be part of Clubs and Player Career, with it being a class system. As part of Archetypes you will be able to unlock and develop different attributes, along with Archetype perks that provide additional bonuses. These perks are based on some of the best players in football. The gameplay is getting overhauled again to make things more fluid and responsive, with examples being better dribbling, improved goalkeeper reactions, better ball behaviour, more fluid passing, and better off the ball player movement and interactions. As part of the overhaul Competitive Gameplay and Authentic Gameplay presets will be available to choose from. Competitive Gameplay is aimed for the multiplayer parts of FC 26 including Clubs and Ultimate Team, while the Authentic preset is more for single player modes like career.</p>
<p>Manager Career is being changed for this release too with the introduction of Manager Live. Manager Live will introduce various challenges into the manager career mode, and there will be new scenarios introduced that are based upon real world football events. In Ultimate Team, there will be new live events and tournaments to take part in. Rivals and Champs will also be given updates too. Finally, EA has confirmed FC 26 will include over 35 leagues, over 750 teams across clubs and international, 120 stadiums, and over 20,000 footballers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review, I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

			<p>Imagine your perfect island retreat. Perhaps there’s white sandy beaches, possibly lush green forests, or maybe mountainous terrain is more your jam. Now imagine a quaint town, with fountains on every corner and houses built straight into the cliff-face. You head to the harbour to watch the fishing boats and look out to the picturesque horizon. Feel more chilled? Me too.</p>
<p>No, you haven’t just fallen into a relaxation exercise hosted by your court-appointed therapist because you went too far with your road rage. Again. This is Islanders: New Shores.</p>
<p><iframe title="ISLANDERS: New Shores | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3hCDB-29iI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Islanders: New Shores claims to be a minimalist city-building game, but I’d argue this description is too simple in its own right, because there’s nothing minimal about the joy this relaxing game brings to the player. The gameplay is gloriously simple and beautifully accessible, not needing to mess around with complex menus and long-winded tutorials. Dropping you straight into the first of twenty levels, you receive a quick overview of the basics of camera movement and placing buildings and you’re off.</p>
<p>As the levels progress, you unlock new and exciting buildings to add to your island. Each new building has its own specific placement requirements, including variations in height, light levels, nature and accompanying buildings. It’s easy to get the hang of which buildings go where to rack up the most points. Plus, the more points you gain, the more boons you unlock to help you on your paradise-building adventure.</p>


<p>Even though Islanders: New Shores is a score-based game, it feels in no way competitive. You find you want to rack up more points because then you get to keep on playing. Because Islanders: New Shores is addictively relaxing. And if the point-scoring feels like it gets in the way of you achieving your chillest form, there’s a tranquil sandbox mode to potter around in too.</p>
<p>So how does Islanders: New Shores manage to be so darn soothing? The original soundtrack sets the mood with peaceful vibes for you to unwind to. Plus, the gameplay visuals truly are stunning. The combinations of vibrant colours are serene and dreamlike, the building designs intricately detailed. It’s important to also mention the islands themselves. With each new level, the player gets to choose which island and feature they’d like to play with next, but even if the basic features are similar, you’ll never see the same island twice. New layouts and landscapes keep each level fresh and interesting.</p>
<p>The same goes for the buildings. The more of each structure you place, the more variants you’ll get to see. Each new harbour has different boats in it. Each new mansion has a different rooftop configuration. For some structures, like the houses, seaweed farms and platforms, the game provides you with different building shapes and encourages you to slot them together, tetris-style, to maximise your points. The game guides you by clearly marking when your building can or can’t fit into certain spaces and displaying the score you’ll gain – or lose – when you set it down. Choose wisely, because there’s no moving your buildings after the fact and hitting “undo” too much can reduce your score multiplier at the end of the level. This can be a bit tricksy, especially when the subtlety of the selection highlight occasionally makes it unclear as to what you’re going to come out with once you’ve tapped your controller button.</p>

<p>You would think with the requirement for jigsaw-puzzle precision placement you need to be able to get in real close to slot your buildings in with accuracy to maximise your score. Sadly, the zoom option can be a little hit and miss at times. The taller your island, the less you’ll be able to see of the items you place closer to sea level. This is a real shame because the intricate details of the building designs deserve to be admired up close and personal.</p>
<p>So now you know, Islanders: New Shores is so much more than just a minimalist city-building game. The radiant visuals and atmospheric soundtrack add a sense of tranquillity to this easily accessible and relaxingly straightforward paradise-builder.</p>
