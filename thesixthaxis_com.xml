		<p>Pine Studios has announced a sequel to Escape Simulator, unsurprisingly called Escape Simulator 2. This new entry to the escape room genre will feature even more scenarios for players to figure their way out of, with up to eight players able to play together. The announcement trailer gives a look at what kind of environments players should expect in Escape Simulator 2.</p>

<p><em>“A sequel gives us the opportunity to start fresh and push the boundaries of the escape room genre. For Escape Simulator 2, we were inspired to explore darker themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle mechanics. This sequel also brings significant technical upgrades, including a new rendering engine, rewritten netcode, improved physics, and enhanced animations. While Escape Simulator 2 adopts a darker, more mysterious tone compared to the original, it’s not a horror game—there are no jump scares or gore. We love the Escape Simulator community and we plan to continue</em><br>
<em>supporting the original game while expanding and enhancing Escape Simulator 2 after its</em><br>
<em>launch”, </em>said Boris Barbir, Co-Founder at Pine Studio.</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will allow players to try and puzzle their way out of Dracula’s castle, a stranded spaceship, and look for cursed treasure. These are just three of the 12 scenarios that will be part of the base game. There will be a room editor too that will allow players to create their own puzzles and share them with the wider community. Escape Simulator will be available on PC via Steam.</p>
