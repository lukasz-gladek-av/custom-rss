		<p>Forget the weather or the date, you know we’re in a new season because of the games coming out. That’s right, it’s straight into silly season, with Silksong’s launch crashing all the console and PC stores yesterday, Hell Is Us, Cronos: The New Dawn and more! I’ll personally be making a start on Indiana Jones’&nbsp;The Order of Giants DLC today.</p>
<p>But maybe it’s actually spooky game season already? I’d say it traditionally starts in October, but Laura has other ideas, as she’s been playing Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. She says, “It’s fun switching between characters and I’m enjoying getting into Banishers lore. Plus Red has the most luscious Scottish accent, so what’s not to love?”</p>

<p>Adding weight to the spooky games in September theory is Steve, who’s reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> from Bloober Team –&nbsp;“I enjoyed it a lot and will play NG+ on when I find the time.” But time waits for no man, so he’s also been playing the “aggressively mediocre” Lost Soul Aside for review, a bit of Davy X Jones as it heads into Early Access, and has jumped into the classic action adventure of Otherskin. Ha, and he’s made a start on Silksong as well, so there’s that!</p>
<p>Aran has been continuing on with Wild Hearts and reckons he’s getting to the ending, so he’s grinding his way through gear upgrades before tackling the finale. Gringing away to improve his own skills is Ade, who’s sticking with Marvel Rivals, has joined a faction and is even thinking he might take part in an upcoming PlayStation Tournament thingy.</p>


<p>It’s been BlazBlue Entropy Effect for Jason, who says that “it slaps” and demands to know “Why did nobody tell me about it sooner?” He’s also been playing He Is Coming, but cannot get a win in the Kingmaker mode.</p>
<p>It’s been a struggle for Nic, who’s little one is poorly and had no time to play games because of it –&nbsp;I helpfully suggested Dr. Mario or the old Trauma Center games –&nbsp;and Gamoc’s also had a somewhat sucky time of it, but has snuck in some The Rogue Prince of Persia, Ghost of Tsushima, HIrogami and Discounty, albeit only in smaller doses.</p>

<p>And finally, Dom has played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/madden-26-review/">Madden 26</a> and Star Wars: Outlaws on Switch 2, and you’ll soon get to read about just how impressed he is with the latter this afternoon, while Jim played some Sword of the Sea which, “to nobody’s surprise, is a cross between Journey and ABZU.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>
