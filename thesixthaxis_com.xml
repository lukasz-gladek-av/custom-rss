		<p>One of the mysterious features of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Joy-Con is the C-button, and now Nintendo has revealed all about what this new button does. C stands for GameChat.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is catching up to other consoles with social features and party chat built into the system. This is all triggered and controlled by using the C-button on the right Joy-Con, while the Switch 2 has a microphone built into it with noise cancelling to isolate your voice.</p>


<p>During the demonstration, Nintendo showed this mostly with all chat participants having their games displayed on screen, shrinking your own game view to accommodate a bar of other screens at the bottom. Those views can also be enhanced with the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, able to overlay each person onto their screen.</p>
<p>GameChat requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but Nintendo is giving a welcome offer until 31st March 2026.</p>
<p>Also tied in with GameChat is GameShare. This is a new game feature that allows you to share a game with up to four players, either over local wireless or through GameChat, enabling split-screen and shared screen multiplayer games to work with multiple systems. This feature is applied on a game-by-game basis, starting with 51 Worldwide Games, and needs to be patched into older Nintendo Switch titles, and will also come to select Switch 2 games.</p>

<p>The only concern we have with all of this is that the frame rate of all the shared views were really, really quite low frame rate. Like, really bad low frame rate.</p>

		<p>One of the biggest games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 is Mario Kart World, the next generation of kart racer and the first wholly new game in the series for over a decade, with huge free-roam racing at its core.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 9 will be launching exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F56lyG9zbWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/"> teased during the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> back in January, Nintendo has now confirmed a lot of the rumour and speculation over the game.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 9 will now support up to 24-player races, doubling the player count from Mario Kart 8 and before. Additionally, there’s much larger and more ambitious maps and locales, bringing in new elements such as filling stations – first spotted as a Yoshi-branded motorway filling station in the January teaser. There was also DK Pass, a jungle setting, what looks like a Wario circuit, a haunted one and more. We’ll dive into this as soon as we can. Racing will span the globe, with changing time of day and weather to change the atmosphere.</p>

<p>You’ll take on sequences of 4 races in a cup, but there’s also new Knockout Tour that joins up race circuits as you race from one side of the map to the other, with elimination if you’re too low in the rankings, and a full free roam mode to just go off-piste as much as you want.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more teases in the trailer, including rail grinding and wall jumping, and some new power ups including giant mode, throwable hammers, a multi-hit coin block and more. You can even commandeer some world vehicles. Separately, you can eat food which gives some costume transformations.</p>
<p>More details will be revealed in a Mario Kart World Direct is coming on 17th April 2025.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we got a much better look at the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. The new console builds on the familiar design and features of the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console that can be used handheld, on TV or propped up on a tabletop, but that form has been evolved. The screen is larger, the Joy-Con have a new connection style, and there’s some new functionality as well.</p>
