		<p>As we venture into the final hours of the year, and with some parts of the world are already sneaking into the next, it’s time to reveal our overall <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> winner!</p>
<p>We’ve been doling out awards for a whole host of categories, from looking at our favourite visuals, audio, and narratives of the year, to breaking games out into their genres, including a new run-based Roguelike category. For the overall winner, the favourites and front runners would have been obvious to see from the off, but who comes out on top?</p>
<p>We’re highlighting the top three, as usual, but our winner is…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a> has climbed to the top of the mountain to claim our Overall Game of the Year Award 2025, and for good reason. Sucker Punch’s follow up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tshushima</a> is stronger in every way from the story, the combat, but most importantly the world. Ghost of Yotei’s open world of Ezo is one that is crafted so well that it invites you to explore, and you accept that invitation willingly.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch has crafted an environment where exploration is signalled by clues within the environment, like trees covered in flowers, and smoke on the horizon tapping into your curiosity. Ghost of Yotei’s world is made stronger by having a variety of environments to explore across its regions, each hiding its own dangers and secrets. The world itself is inhabited by interesting characters that weave in and out of Atsu’s story, be it through the mainline path, side missions, and even the bounty hunts that feed into the overall narrative.</p>
<p>As I said in my Ghost of Yōtei review, “This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.” And the journey is not over with the Legends content coming in 2026 that will draw so many of us back to Ezo’s shores.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is just a beautiful game. It begins strong, with an irresistibly intriguing setup: in a fractured world where Paris sits upon one of few islands amidst the chaos an unravelling world, the Paintress, a giant with long hair covering her face, sits beside a monolith with the number 34 on it. She erases the number and replaces it with 33, and everyone of that age fades into oblivion. Another in a long line of expeditions readies itself to try and destroy her, including Gustave, whose long lost love just turned into smoke and flower petals. It’s just as strange and mysterious right up until the very end.</p>
<p>It’s not just story and setting, though. There’s also an intricate turn-based combat system that, when harnessed properly, can make you feel very powerful indeed. All of the characters play completely differently as well, each one a completely new playstyle to fiddle around with, but each as potentially strong as the other. On top of that, there’s a parry and dodge system, allowing you to pull victory from the jaws of defeat by ably parrying and countering if you’re good enough. Whilst it may be challenging to read the fiendishly deceptive attack animations, successfully countering a combo of six attacks is at least satisfying enough to be worth it. Clair Obscur is a remarkable achievement for such a small studio and remains one of biggest surprises and one of best games of the year.</p>

<h3>Hades 2 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>One hundred and three. That’s the number of times I’ve commenced a run in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a>, either sending the magic-spell concocting Melinoë on a descent to the dark-depths of the underworld, or having her travel across the surface to clamber atop Mount Olympus. Just like the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>, the combat remains crisp, responsive and utterly beguiling; it’s a hectic action-packed thrill-ride of a game, yet you never lose the ability to tell what’s going on despite the onscreen fireworks. In fact, even with the many roguelite imitators over the intervening years, none of the emulators have been able to achieve this perfect balance of spectacle and nuance. It took the return of Supergiant Games to show the rest how it’s done.</p>
<p>What impresses even more, is how that, after some fifty hours into the game, it’s still introducing brilliant new mechanics, fascinating new characters and entirely new storylines to me. Talk about confidence, Supergiant Games saved a lot of the best stuff until tens of hours after the end credits rolled.</p>
<p>My final point as to why Hades 2 is well deserving a place on the GOTY podium; it offers an absolutely perfect interpretation of the larger-than-life icons of Ancient Greek mythology, exploring the volatile relationships between gods, heroes and monsters. It’s a masterclass in bringing new life to ancient mythology.</p>
<p>How do Supergiant Games do it?</p>

		<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/">dealabs.com</a> has got the scoop on one of the games coming to PS Plus January 2026. According to their sources, the main title for January will be Need for Speed: Unbound on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Need for Speed Unbound - Speed Race Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBPZapIh4MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Criterion developed the game and it was published in 2022 by EA, and when it was released we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/05/need-for-speed-unbound-review/">9/10 in our review</a>, calling it “the best arcade racer of 2022”. Since then it has had multiple updates but support for the game ended in in 2024 when Criterion moved on to help make Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 title is the PS5 version as Sony&nbsp; announced that January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>

<p><em>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 games should be officially revealed later today on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/">PlayStation Blog.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December until January 6th, 2026</p>
