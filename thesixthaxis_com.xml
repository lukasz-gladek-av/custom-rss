		<p>The Binding of Isaac has received a new free DLC today, called Repentance+, that adds online multiplayer to the game. The new update allows up to four players to play together and run through the game. However, to run the new Repentance+ DLC, all players will require all of the previously released DLC for The Binding of Isaac for it to work, and mods are not compatible with the online side of the game. While Nicalis is calling this a beta, it has been confirmed this DLC is feature complete.</p>

<p>In The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ players can play on Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier and do Challenges. There are also Daily Runs that will provide different challenges for players to tackle too. Achievements can be unlocked online, but only if you are present from the start of a run. Joining partway through a run will not count towards unlocking any achievements. Online play has some differences from solo play, including defeated bosses dropping loot for each player. Those who join a run partway through will be given items so they are not at a disadvantage compared to players who were present from the beginning. If a player dies, the rest of the team can choose to revive a player at a revive machine on each floor, though the cost of revival goes up every time a machine is used. Alternatively, the remaining players can try and defeat bosses without their fallen teammates as being successful also revives teammates. The full changelog can be seen below.</p>

<p>Item Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tammy’s Head – Reduced the duration of the animation when using Tammy’s Head, allowing Isaac to fire more quickly after use.</li>
<li>Lemon Mishap – Slightly increased the size of the puddle. Also, the puddle will now persist until Isaac exits the room.</li>
<li>Mega Bean – Creates a catastrophic fart that sweeps the entire room.</li>
<li>Milk! – The familiar now follows closely behind Isaac and blocks shots. After 10 hits, the glass will break and give Isaac a Tears upgrade for the remainder of the floor.</li>
<li>Delirious – Summoned bosses will now persist through rooms. Only one boss can be active at a time. The charge is now variable, based on the quality of the previously summoned boss.</li>
<li>Jar of Wisps – Reduced to a 6-room charge, allowing the wisps to stack up to the maximum number more quickly.</li>
<li>Abyss – Item quality now impacts the damage of the summoned locust. Locusts now inherit many different effects based on the item destroyed by Abyss.</li>
<li>Flip – Charge has been reduced to 4 rooms for Tainted Lazarus only.</li>
<li>Portable Slot – Removed from the Shop pool. Added as a possible reward from slot machines.</li>
<li>Void – Charge has been reduced from 6 rooms to 4.</li>
<li>Epiphora – The Tears upgrade from firing in a single direction is now a smooth increase, instead of being staggered every few seconds.</li>
<li>God’s Flesh – Doubled the chance of shrink tears firing. Shrunken enemies now briefly flash white before growing back to full size. Enemies that explode, fire shots or summon minions on death can no longer hurt Isaac if they’re killed while shrunken.</li>
<li>Hushy – While held in place, Hushy now fires radial bursts of shots.</li>
<li>It Hurts – After taking damage, Isaac’s tears will now leave behind small pools of blood creep for the room.</li>
<li>Mars – In addition to being invulnerable when charging, Isaac will gain a 1-second bubble of invulnerability after the charge. Hitting obstacles also causes a knockback effect to clear any threats from the surrounding area.</li>
<li>Evil Charm – Isaac now gains immunity to spider-web slowdown, flame attacks, fireplaces and poison mushrooms. Isaac can also stand in enemy creep for 1 second before taking damage.</li>
<li>Vasculitis – Friendly radial shots fired after killing an enemy will now appear as blood clots to more easily distinguish them.</li>
<li>Lil’ Portal – Has been completely reworked. Double-tapping a fire button is now required to launch Lil’ Portal. After it has consumed enough items and the room is clear, a single portal will spawn and the familiar will now disappear for the remainder of the floor. Entering this portal now takes Isaac to a room where he can pick up or drop off items. This room persists throughout the rest of the current run.</li>
<li>Linger Bean – The fart cloud is now deployed after 4 seconds of continuous fire (instead of 7 seconds). The cloud starts small and potent, and will grow and deal reduced damage over the course of 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Jupiter – Now heals 2 red hearts instead of just ½.</li>
<li>Butter Bean – Recharge time has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2.</li>
<li>The Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Kidney Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Dead Bird – Will remain active between rooms as long as the player is at ½ heart. (Note: Eve requires 1 full heart.)</li>
<li>Data Miner – Using Data Miner in a room with an item pedestal will now reroll it into a glitched item.</li>

		<p>Reuters has published a story that states Sony is looking to acquire the Japanese media conglomerate Kadokawa, which has a number of brands under its various umbrellas. Kadokawa has investments within publishing, films, and the games industry. Most notably with the games industry, Kadokawa owns a majority share of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring developer FromSoftware. It also owns Spike Chunsoft and Acquire.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sony owns a 2% stake in Kadokawa already, with Tencent having approximately 7% of the company. If Sony wanted to outright buy Kadokawa it would have to buy out Tencent’s shares too, though Sony may also choose to keep Tencent has a minority partner in the business. Sony also owns a minority of shares within FromSoftware, so buying Kadokawa would transfer ownership of the Elden Ring developer to Sony, along with ownership of Spike Chunsoft and Acquire. It is not yet clear how much Sony would pay for Kadokawa, but ther reports suggest that deal could be struck within the next few weeks. If Sony does complete this acquisition not only would it boost its videogame portfolio, but it would also expand its presence in the anime and manga markets, book publishing, and also have a bigger presence in the Japanese film industry too.</p>
<p>Kadokawa has recently suffered some setbacks within the last couple of years. In 2022, the chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa was arrested on bribery charges with it being related to becoming an official sponsor for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. He announced he would resign on October 4th, 2022. Earlier this year, Kadokawa became the target of a ransomware attack with its websites being breached. The group behind it, Blacksuit, claimed to hold 1.5 terabytes of stolen data including personnel information and user data.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-review.1039215/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/new-world-aeternum-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world-aeternum">New World: Aeternum</a> asks what would happen if – instead of the Americas – we stumbled upon a volatile fantasy realm where legends come to life. And where they never perish…</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an adventurer who takes to the high seas, you soon find yourself shipwrecked on its stormy shores, your destiny forever changed. While Aeternum boasts a stunning natural beauty and a bounty of precious resources streaked, there’s a growing corruption sweeping the land, drawing dark and unseen forces into a wider conflict as humans look to make their mark upon this untamed land.</p>


<p>New World: Aeternum is very much an action-oriented MMORPG. The game sports an active combat system similar to souslike RPGs thanks to an intuitive lock-on camera while rewarding well-time blocks and dodges – elements that will feel somewhat alien to fans of traditional MMOs.</p>


<p>These same fans may also baulk at New World’s streamlined character builds. Instead of choosing a class and gradually filling the screen with hotbars and icons, players can only slot a total of six abilities (split between their two equipped weapons) with branching skill trees add a satisfying amount of depth. Weapon pairings will ultimately dictate your role in combat, though New World does give the option to freely switch and experiment, allowing you to completely respec without too much admin involved.</p>
<p>The straightforward controls and condensed ability loadouts complement New World’s fresh console ports particularly well. Navigating chat windows and some of the more advanced menus can get a bit finicky on a gamepad yet it feels like the game was always designed with console players in mind, rather than being an afterthought.</p>
<p>Unlocking its doors to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S isn’t the only thing that’s new for New World: Aeternum. Since the game originally launched on PC there have been a glut of content drops, new features, and quality of life improvements. One of the most notable upgrades is a renewed focus on storytelling and worldbuilding through improved character interactions and cutscenes. It’s clear that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/amazon-game-studios">Amazon Game Studios</a> has poured a lot of love into the lore and presentation of its flagship MMO with fully-voiced NPCs and a living in-game codex that grows as you learn more about the realm of Aeternum and its denizens.</p>

<p>Archetypes are another new addition to New World: Aeternum that will help you slip into one of its many flexible playstyles. After all, while the solo levelling experience is relatively agnostic of the weapons you choose, group PvE activities such as Expeditions and Raids – as well as PvP – require players to choose a role whether that’s a thank, DPS, or healer.</p>
<p>However, it will be a while before you can fully immerse yourself in team play with much of this content unlocking when you hit the game’s original level cap of 60. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long to reach this milestone. For my Mystic (New World’s de facto healer/support archetype) it took around 30 hours of mostly main story quests and Expeditions with limited uptake of side missions.</p>
<p>Aside from straight up duels, there are plenty of PvP options in New World including a recently introduced 3 versus 3 Arena and the more objective-based 40-player Outpost Rush. Then there’s the ongoing Faction War that permeates in the game’s persistent world. Soon after washing up on the shores of Aeternum, you can choose to ally with the Covenant, Syndicate, or Marauders, who are locked in a never ending conflict. Through careful planning and brute opportunism Companies (player-run guilds) can occupy the many settlements found spread across the map, first working collectively to gain influence and then throwing down in massive siege battles.</p>

<p>Away from combat and questing, New World offers a comprehensive crafting system that is split between gathering supplies and then processing these into materials, gear, or sellable goods. Choosing a certain archetype will give you a small boost in certain crafting skills though you’re truly free to pursue any at your own leisure, from refining ore and engineering muskets to fishing and building furniture for your home. Oh yes, there’s player housing.</p>
<p>Beyond its walled cities, townships, and makeshift settlements, Aeternum offers a diverse patchwork of biomes each teeming with life. Covered in forests and fauna, there’s an element of untouched natural beauty streaked with the occasional gash of red and a dense dark miasma to signal the presence of corruption. Each region has its own aesthetic and local tales, rewarding inquisitive players with little nuggets of lore and painting a more detailed picture of Aeternum’s mysterious past. These areas are well populated too, New World touting a bestiary of wild animals to hunt as well as a grimoire of exotic creatures from zombie pirates and mystic dryads to cosmic horrors from another dimension.</p>
