		<p>Developer METROPOLICE has announced a brand new city builder called The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, where you become the Governor of Hell. You are in charge of putting together your own version of the punishment focused underworld, sorting out the souls that find themselves there while also trying to work out all of the secrets of Hell.</p>

<p><em>“Our goal with The HELL: City Builder of the Dead is to bring a fresh perspective to the city-builder genre—by exploring a theme that’s rarely touched,”</em> said Mike Chong, Founder of METROPOLICE. <em>“This is our imagination at play. Players step into the role of a Hell Governor, managing a dark, chaotic vision of the afterlife that also has a giant Titan lurking around the map that the player needs to defeat to advance.”</em></p>
<p>In The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, you will need to manage a delicate balance by managing the arrivals. Fail to do so and these sinners may attempt to cause chaos to destroy everything. In addition to the sinners, there are the Titans that rule each of the realms of Hell. Each of the Titans is inspired by various mythologies and to fully uncover the secrets of Hell you will need to defeat the Titans.</p>

<p>The Hell: City Builder of the Dead will enter Steam Early Access on Friday, October 24, 2025.</p>
