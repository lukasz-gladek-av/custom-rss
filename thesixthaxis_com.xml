		<p>Square Enix has set the date and time for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game reveal. Tune in next week on Tuesday 20th January at <span dir="auto">10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET for the Life is Strange reveal livestream.</span></p>

<p>The blurb on the YouTube trailer just reads “Separate the real from the rumor… Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game.” However, the more enticing fact is that the placeholder page is titled “Life is Strange Returns in 2026.”</p>


<p>Unfortunately for Square Enix, Life is Strange: Reunion was leaked last week by the PEGI ratings board. The synopsis for the game on the now removed listing read “Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.”</p>
<p>Sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>The Life is Strange series has been in the hands of Deck Nine for a good few years now, with the IP held by Square Enix and original developer Dontnod branching off to other projects since Life is Strange 2. Having bounced between new protagonists and settings, Deck Nine brought us back to Max Caulfield’s story with 2024’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/">our review</a>, Reu said, “Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a very easy game to recommend. If you have enjoyed previous games in the series, this is doing enough of the same to scratch that same lowkey mystery vibes itch. The ability to shift between timelines can become a touch overwhelming at times, but there’s several things in place across the UI, accessibility options, and narrative flow to keep the gameplay smooth. What’s more, I think this game might have redeemed Max Caulfield for me too, so take that how you will.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the writing already on the wall in red paint after the confirmation that no new content would be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world-aeternum">New World: Aeternum</a> after the current season, it’s now been confirmed that Amazon’s MMORPG will be shutting down in January 2027. The game is also being delisted today and is no longer available for purchase.</p>
<p>In a farewell message alongside the announcement, the team writes, “<span>We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</span></p>


<p>The game server shutdown is scheduled for 31st January 2027, and with the game being delisted from sale today, that means a full year’s notice is being given before service is removed for the game. Additionally, Marks of Fortune, the premium in-game currency, will be removed from sale on 20th July.</p>
<p>Because you’ll still be able to play the game, and as a kind of “why not?” the Nighthaven season will be extended through to the very end, however this game is just being left to sail into the night. There won’t be any content changes, and even as the player base inevitably dwindles, there also will not be any further server merges. The only exception is that they will monitor bugs and performance issues.</p>

<p>New World’s failure is pretty significant. The game arrived with a huge bang in 2021, as Amazon brought its fantasy colonialist MMORPG to PC, racing to a huge peak of over 900,000 concurrent players that pushed the servers beyond the limit. After such a strong start, the playerbase (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>) dwindled through early 2022, but enjoyed a new peak of over 130,000 for the first yearly expansion. Perhaps a lot of expectation was put internally on the potential of the console port, which arrived with a major game overhaul last September in the form of New World: Aeternum, but on PC at least, the game has spent much of 2025 with daily peak player counts below 10,000, jumping up to 50,000 with the new Nighthaven update.</p>
<p>However, since the announced end of new content updates, the player count has understandably fallen to new lows. It last cracked the 2,000 player mark on 7th December and has been around 1,300 the last few days.</p>
<p>I’m sure plenty will log in for one last hurrah next January, just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/12/anthem-has-now-gone-offline-forever-servers-get-shutdown/">as was done for Anthem</a> in the last few days.</p>
