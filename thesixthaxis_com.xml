		<p>Hands up if you had snow overnight? Well lucky you, because while I still have a chill in the air in my neck of the woods, it’s merely accompanied by wind and some rain. My cat is thoroughly unimpressed by this and he can’t keep himself entertained with playing Flight Simulator, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> or GT7 this weekend.</p>
<p>OK, maybe he’ll watch…</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been playing this past week.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> came back from a Peter Hook gig in Belfast and got right back into making his own music in Dreams. He’s also started replaying Dishonored: The Knife of Dunwall DLC.</li>
<li><strong>Andrewww’s</strong> hand was firmly in the air at the head of this round-up, with 20cm of snow last night! Before he got snowed in, he managed to reach the end of Horizon Forbidden West, and managed to clear&nbsp;<em>most</em> of the map of things to do. He also liked the accessibility options that helped remove some of the more unnecessary inputs when interacting with things.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>
