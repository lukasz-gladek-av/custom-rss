		<p>Around a year after its debut, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> is getting its biggest update yet, with a big update for the existing experience (now rebranded as LEGO Fortnite Odyssey) and a whole new social roleplaying game LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Both will be available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> client later this week on 12th December, with LEGO Fortnite now a permanent unique category for all the modes and UGC within.</p>

<p>Let’s start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it’s up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you’ll look for Storm Dungeons to take on – these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There’s some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You’ll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier – Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor – Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer – Make sure crime doesn’t pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel – Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef – Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista – Serve Brick Bay’s most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller – What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that’s in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there’s the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>

			<p>Right, let’s get this out of the way early, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind sadly isn’t very good. I know, I know, I’m as disappointed as you are as this felt like it would be the second coming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> just with Power Rangers – who are probably, maybe, just as awesome as our friendly neighbourhood heroes in a half-shell. A 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em up with retro arcade visuals and shoot ‘em up sections, I mean, what could go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off though, in terms of what it <em>does</em> get right, Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind absolutely nails the aesthetic. The opening theme-music drips nostalgia and superbly sets the tone, giving you all of the retro feels. For people of a certain age, this is your childhood, but in 2024. Even better, the game itself has the sheen of a coin-up arcade screen overlaying the visuals, really cementing the sense of playing this game in your local arcade – you know, the one that no longer exists.</p>


<p>The chunky pixellated characters have a lot of charm, the Rangers themselves ninja flipping smoothly across the levels, whilst the never-ending horde of Putties you face are decent, if rather bland, punching bags. Thankfully, the look of the bosses is much more like it, correctly channelling the Saturday-morning TV shoddiness of the original much-loved Power Rangers series.</p>
<p>Smartly, the game is subdivided into a TV episode structure. Your team of Rangers face reams of goons, before battling a boss who, of course, runs off. You give chase in your Dinozord, blasting away in shooting sections that honour the almost-3D sequences of Sega’s classic game Afterburner. Then the boss gets biggified and your Dinozords combine to build the mech-like Megazord, resulting in a ginormous scrap.</p>


<p>Sadly, once you get to actually playing Power Rangers: Rita’s Revenge, things fall apart pretty quickly. Beat ‘em up sections are dull and pedestrian, with lacklustre collision detection proving a constant irritation. Think you’re lined up on the correct parallel plain to punch a Putty? Well, the game is pretty sure you are wrong, every time. Resulting in your Ranger unleashing a devastating flurry of fist-based pain on some innocent thin air.</p>
<p>Next to nothing of interesting or note happens across a level either; you pummel the same small selection of goons again and again and there are no weapons to pick-up or vehicles to control. Even local co-op fails to elevate proceedings, due to the Rangers themselves playing exactly the same. Sure, their disappointingly limited range of attacks look a bit different, but they have identical form and function. Unlike, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge you won’t find any levelling up or new attacks to unlock here, just the same paltry selection of attack combos, jumps and throws.</p>
<p>Even the ultimate attacks are basically just colour-pallet swaps; the lack of imagination here, considering the rich and varied source-material, is truly disheartening. Indeed, the only interesting occurrence as you walk from left to right is when a Putty comes out with a green time crystal that rewinds time – admittedly accompanied by neat VHS effects – until you destroy it. Though this one good idea is itself rewound and reused so many times that it is soon rendered dull.</p>

<p>Whilst the beat ‘em up section are serviceable but uninspired, the shoot ‘em-up sections are a mess. Visually incoherent with a smorgasbord of explosions and effects, it’s almost impossible to tell where your Dinozord is as it runs towards the horizon, let alone navigate all the obstacles and enemies heading your way. Unlike Afterburner, Outrun or other arcade titles from the era, these shoot ‘em up section fail to recreate any sense of depth, resulting in even more confusion as everything is given a flat appearance. Good luck trying to tell to how close a runaway truck is, as it supposedly careens its way into your path. Irritating and pointless, the shoot ‘em up levels of this game should have been made skippable.</p>
<p>Which just leaves the Megazord smackdowns, which, frankly, suck. Played from a first-person perspective, the players pass the controller and take it in turn to battle the villain of the week. Dodging attacks, finding an opening, punching the big baddy and charging up your sword is the format. It’s kind of interesting in your first encounter with Goldar, but the same boss-fight structure with a different character model is repeated ad-nauseum.</p>

<p>Controls here are loose and inexact, and the whole thing is frustrating and poorly conceived, with little sense of satisfaction if you emerge triumphant as your victory was likely more down to luck than any skill or intention. You know when players are choosing to skip their go, that this part of the game is a dud.</p>
