		<p>Manticore Games has released a new gameplay trailer for Out of Time, the anachronistic co-op roguelike shooter that is set to launch on 25th September, exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Out of Time Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8Iisl6CU6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Time and reality have been broken in Out of Time by an event known as The Shattering, blending anything and everything together in a mad mish-mash of periods, themes and technology. Depending on the different properties of each roguelike, you could be battling dragons, killer robots or mutant crabs, using medieval swords, plasma cannons, or riding dinosaurs.</p>
<p>There’s a whopping 24 characters to choose to play as, going from the Cyber Medic Yasmine, who features angel wings, to the purple skinned druid Talyndra, mobster Ming, and just a plain ol’ lumberjack named Freya. Each has specific starting abilities, weapons and skills, but comes without a defined class, so you’re free to customise beyond that. You will be pushed to co-operate though, as the game will push you to stay together beyond having complimentary abilities by a tethering system that shares healing and buffs between you.</p>

<p>There’s a shared space called Infinitopia before you head out on each run, with the game worlds taking you to various biomes and the promise that seasonal updates will evolve and change each space.</p>
