		<p>IO Interactive’s James Bond game, Project 007 has a teaser image and a new name, 007 First Light.</p>



<p>The full official reveal of the game will take place later this week, exactly when has not been specified, but as it’s Summer Games Fest tomorrow, that’s probably a good bet.&nbsp; It is rumoured that the game will show us the origin story of James Bond, and the First Light title would fit that rumour.</p>
<p>No platforms have been confirmed by name, but it will be made “for modern systems and platforms,” and is using IOI’s in house Glacier engine. In other words, we can expect it for PS5, <a title="Xbox Series X|S" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and depending on how deep into development the company are, possibly PS4 and Xbox One as well. We’ll just have to wait and see, but the game is already in active development at IOI’s offices in Copenhagen and Malmö.</p>

<p>“It’s true that once in a while, the stars do align in our industry,” said Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive, “Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities. Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio.”</p>
