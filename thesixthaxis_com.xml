		<p>I’ve had an exciting week of playing things I’m not allowed to tell you about yet, but what I can tell you about is the awesome time I’ve been having. 2025 feels like it’s going to be a good year for game fans, and there’s lots of exciting stuff on the way in both Early Access and the wider world.</p>
<p>I’ve covered my bedside table in handhelds in the last week, hopping into Citizen Sleeper 2 on ROG Ally, Puzzle and Dragons Z on the 3DS, Soul Calibur on the Retroid Pocket 2, and the Riki 8-Bit Collection on Nintendo Switch. There is barely room for my books and a brew, stacking them up in an unwieldly and potentially dangerous way. So far, there hasn’t been disaster. So far…</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 this week, buoyed by the new update (which temporarily broke things) and working away on our review of Robobeat. Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> is still in Japan so has had no gaming at all. Keeping us up to date on his trip, he told us, “I have visited Kanazawa, Hiroshima, and currently in Kyoto. Unfortunately this time next week my holiday will be over.” Sorry that the real world beckons, Aran!</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been working on a very special project these last few months, and him and Jim are starting to lift the lid on it! He tells us, “Jim and I gear up to crowd fund the Playing with History book, I’ve been playing a bunch of games with a historical or mythological setting to gather ideas for articles. One of those is Immortals: Rise of Fenyx. I’d bounced off the game on its release but I’ve been thoroughly enjoying playing it in 2025! A pitch perfect interpretation of the Ancient Greek gods, hugely entertaining combat, satisfying puzzles to solve, actually funny; it all adds up to a great open world game!”</p>


<p>When he’s not been working with Ade, <strong>Jim</strong> has continued to creep around in the weird world of Alan Wake II. He says, “I’ve just hit the point of no return and while I’m keen to see how the rest of the story plays out (and wrap up any DLC) it’s been a bit of a mixed bag, overall. The combat gameplay is still weak and cool elements such as the Mind Palace and Case Board aren’t used to their full potential. There are also times where the game feels a little too self indulgent with looping/meandering sections that remind me of the worst parts of Control. At the same time, I’m glad we have games like Alan Wake II.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has occasionally been angry with his games this week, but not much of that was directed at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. He tells us, “I’ve also tried High on Life, which is exactly what you expect except the shooting is surprisingly competent, and I’m slogging through the shocking embarrassment that is Dragon Age The Veilguard. No wonder Mike Laidlaw left the dev, must’ve been like watching a CEO drown his child.” You may, perhaps, be able to tell where his anger has come from.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> also played some Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, doing the legwork for our review video. Once that had been wrapped up, he made a start on Avowed, where he’s going to do the same trick for our review of that. He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/spider-man-2-pc-review/">Spider-Man 2 on PC</a>, finding things to be generally solid if you’re shooting for PS5-like quality.</p>
<p>How about you, what have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 25</a> has been fully cancelled, with the studio now turning its focus to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</a> that fans will now expect for later this year.</p>
<p>All pre-orders of the game will be refunded, though the process for this will depend on the retailer and platform.</p>


<p>FM25 was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/football-manager-25-release-date-set-for-november-26th/">originally planned for release last November</a>, in keeping with the yearly release schedule of the sport management sim, Sports Interactive struggled with the transition to a new game engine. Initially it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">delayed by a few weeks</a>, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">pushed all the way back until March 2025</a>. Any further delays would bring the game too close to the end of the regular footballing season, and too close to the expected November launch of FM26, so FM25 has been cancelled and all the work will be rolled through to the next release.</p>
<p>In their statement, Sports Interactive lays out the timing of this announcement, the challenges faced, and the simple fact that the game was not yet in a fit state to release:</p>
<p><em>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</em></p>

<p><em>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of FM25 we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em>We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line – but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</em></p>
<p><em>Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager.</em></p>
<p><em>Sports Interactive</em></p>
<p>FM25’s development was deeply affected by a switch to the Unity game engine and ambitious efforts to incorporate a full simulation of women’s football for the first time. At the time of the game’s first delay, Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It’s not clear if those will be brought back for FM26, or will still be held back until another future game.</p>
<p>in the FAQ for the cancellation, Sports Interactive stated once again that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/football-manager-24-will-not-be-updated-with-2024-25-season-data/">FM24 will not receive a 2024/25 season update</a> to players and teams. They have said, however, that they will work with game subscription partners to extend deals for FM24 through to the release of the next game.</p>
