		<p>Rockstar Games has announced it is acquiring the Australian based game developer Video Games Deluxe, though it has not disclosed the fee. Video Games Deluxe has been a long time partner studio of Rockstar Games, having worked on the re-release of LA Noire and LA Noire: The VR Files, along with updating Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Going forward, the name Video Games Deluxe will be dropped and the studio renamed to Rockstar Australia.</p>

<p><em>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,</em>” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe in a statement.</p>
<p><em>“It’s been an honor to work closely with&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;this past decade,”</em> said Video Games Deluxe founder&nbsp;Brendan McNamara. <em>“We are thrilled to be a part of&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe was born out of the ashes of Team Bondi, developer of LA Noire, and was founded by Brendan McNamara. We do not know what this means going forward. It could be that Rockstar Australia will support with content and updates for Grand Theft Auto VI, or it could be a signal of intent by Rockstar to have another studio out there that can create more games.</p>
