		<p>A second closed beta for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls has been announced and it launches December 5, 2025 at midnight Pacific Time. It will run until December 7 at 11:59 PM. On the 5th and 6th of December you will be able to battle both online and with CPU opponents, with this being reduced to online only on the 7th of&nbsp; December.</p>
<p>You should be able to<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/"> sign up for the closed beta here.</a></p>

<p>The six playable characters from the first beta, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Ms Marvel, Storm, Captain America and Star-Lord, will be joined by Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Two new stages, Savage Land and the X-Mansion have been added to the beta. You will also be able to use the communal space and spectate games.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback received from the previous closed beta, we’ve implemented numerous improvements, including balance adjustments, performance optimizations, visual enhancements, and user experience upgrades. More details will be shared as we get closer to the beta test,” explains Kazuto Sekine, Game Director and Lead Battle Designer.</p>

<p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Soulsis a tag fighter but it is pushing the boundary to be a 4v4 system. There are different ways to approach it. You can use one fighter with the other three in the team being assists, or swap through each character to work out the different styles that they have.</p>
<p>The game is a big collaboration between Sony, Marvel and Arc System Works, who have developed some of the most celebrated fighting games of the past decade including Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dragon Ball FighterZ, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote,&nbsp;“By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have revealed a DLC expansion for Elden Ring: Nightreign,and it’s coming out soon. Really soon. Elden Ring: Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows will launch on 4th December 2025. That’s less than a month away!</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Forsaken Hollows will bring additional Nightfarers, Bosses and more into the multiplayer spin-off to one of FromSoftware’s most beloved games.</p>
<p>The update will introduce the Scholar and the Undertaker as two new playable Nightfarers. They’re described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar</strong> –&nbsp;An academic who walks the Lands Between. Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.</li>
<li><strong>Undertaker –</strong>&nbsp;An abbess who was mandated to slay the Nightlord. Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two new bosses will also feature in this DLC expansion, and there will be the new area of The Great Hollow, which adds a cavity to explore under Limveld. This includes exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers from forgotten peoples, and crystals and have a life-draining miasma that you’ll probably want to avoid.</p>

<p>Those that pre-order the DLC will receive a digital artbook and mini soundtrack as downloadable apps, though these were previously available as part of the Deluxe Edition and Deluxe Upgrade Pack. In fact, The Forsaken Hollows DLC is included for those who bought the Collectors Edition or Deluxe Edition of Nightreign.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign didn’t gather quite the same level of acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>
