<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em></p>
<p><em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration. Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Account suspension</em></li>
<li><em>In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em></li>
<li><em>No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>

<p>There is currently no similar announcement regarding for MiHoYo’s Zenless Zone Zero or Honkai Star Rail. While the exact US law has not yet been detailed by the studio, and there are a number of age verification laws across the country which vary State by State.</p>
