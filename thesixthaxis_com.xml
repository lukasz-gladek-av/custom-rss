		<p>Shiro Games has revealed its next project and it is an online co-operative action game called Farever, which is set in the world of Siagarta. The world is full of unknowns and will require players to explore every corner of it to find its secrets. Shiro Games is building a rep for building these kinds of games, such as its upcoming space based co-op title<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/spacecraft-is-the-new-game-from-shiro-games/"> SpaceCraft</a>.</p>

<p><em>“In&nbsp;<span>Farever</span>, adventure is always around the corner,”</em> said Nicolas Cannasse, CEO, Shiro Games. <em>“We’re thrilled to reveal the game during the PC Gaming Show and can’t wait to invite players to Siagarta for co-op exploration when&nbsp;<span>Farever</span>&nbsp;comes to Steam.”</em></p>
<p>Farever will feature 10 different classes, and there will be an Early Access period that will feature four of those classes. There will also be over 100 weapons available in the full release, with every single weapon having its own set of unique skills. Fighting will not be the only thing that players will be doing in Siagarta either. To traverse the world there will be platforming challenges and environmental puzzles to solve. Players can take on different jobs too such as blacksmithing or becoming a cook, with both skills being helpful to solo players and groups. Farever’s content will scale with group sizes so there is always a challenge to face as well. Those challenges could come from any of the various factions that inhabit the land including the Crimson Rams, the Heralds, the Kobolds, the Nepsids, and the different guilds.</p>
