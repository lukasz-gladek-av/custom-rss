		<p>Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertianment, has stepped down with immediate effect, in mutual agreement with the company’s Board of Directors. Markus Mäki, one of the studio’s founders and Chairman of the Board up until this point, is shifting across to be interim CEO, and Board member Henri Österlund is stepping up to be the new Chairman.</p>
<p>Remedy’s interim CEO Markus Mäki said, “I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.”</p>


<p>The change of leadership comes a few weeks after <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy revised their financial outlook</a>, off the back of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak’s</a> underperformance. Having launched in June, the game immediately struggled, with Remedy working to bring major overhauls to their first live service title. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/30/fbc-firebreak-drops-its-first-major-update-today-bringing-new-missions-enemies-and-mods-to-the-game/">This launched on 29th September</a>, but despite bringing “improved player and sales metrics after the update, sales have not reached Remedy’s internal targets.”&nbsp;This leaves the company with “a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to FBC: Firebreak.”</p>
<p>A Q3 2025 business review will come on 29h October to provide a broader picture of the studio’s development efforts and future outlook.</p>
<p>Remedy enjoyed many highs through Virtala’s tenure as CEO, who joined the company just as they were looking for new independence and impetus after a long period of working exclusively with Microsoft. That included a first IPO to secure funding to grow into a multi-game studio, &nbsp;and to partnerships with 505 Games and Smilegate in the early years. This, in turn, produced the major hit for the company that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a> (and the easily forgotten dud that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crossfirex">CrossfireX</a>), and the company rode that momentum to gain new partnerships and investment. A significant deal with Epic Games brought the Alan Wake Remastered and a slick and very well received horror sequel in Alan Wake 2. They’ve also secured funding for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2,</a> and bought back rights to go it alone.</p>

<p>In the name of diversifying their portfolio, Remedy ventured into multiplayer gaming with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, but the game has underperformed, and alongside slower sales for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/26/alan-wake-2-review/">Alan Wake 2</a> that outside observers might have expected, put a bit of a dent into their status on the stock market. Since nearly hitting share prices of €50 in 2021, they’ve slid back down to around €13.</p>
<p>To be clear, Remedy’s new outlook is that revenue will still increase over last year, but that operating profit from ongoing development projects will be negative. The push is now to forge ahead with work on the Max Payne remakes and Control 2, with more details on these to come at next week’s business review.</p>

			<p>Back in the ancient past of the late 20th century there was a real push towards games emulating animated films. While this was generally more a matter of marketing spiel than anything substantial, the true pioneer of this approach was the classic (albeit terrible) Dragon’s Lair, a game which used the beautiful animation of Don Bluth to stitch together gameplay that was more akin to a lengthy QTE than anything else. The timeless nature of this approach means that the original game still holds up visually to this day. Modern gaming has taken a turn towards hyper-realism with the increase in processing power, so Bye Sweet Carole stands out as much as Dragon’s Lair did, for different reasons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bye Sweet Carole - Launch Trailer | Available Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CsIxYSRkfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can’t discuss Bye Sweet Carole without beginning with the aesthetics. The animated style – far more reminiscent to me of Don Bluth than the comparisons to Disney that are being thrown around – is stunning and gives the game a truly unique character which feels deliberately at odds with the darker and more sinister aspects of the game. Characters and backgrounds are memorable and distinctive, whilst enemies flow in a creepy and sludgy way. The level of detail is admirable and the relatively compact world becomes easy to navigate and explore.</p>


<p>Music and voice acting are also strong here, with a fully voiced script and music that is both atmospheric and emotional, perfectly fitting the game’s touching narrative. While you can skip the dialogue (useful for when you have to rewatch scenes after deaths) it is well worth letting them play out the first time – there’s even an achievement for doing so.</p>


<p>The story of Bye Sweet Carole feels like a true coming of age (or bildungsroman as we call it in the literary trade). The titular Carole is absent from the game, with the plot revolving around her best friend, Lana, attempting to discover how she disappeared, and eventually coming to terms with life without her. This is an emotional story of friendship, grief, and loss that is made even more interesting by being wrapped up in the context of the early 20th century suffragette movement. The shifts in expectations and hopes for young women during this time provide a crucial backdrop to the events.</p>
<p>So far, so glowingly positive, and I would definitely recommend playing Bye Sweet Carole for all the experiences described above but the gameplay is a bit more of a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The ‘survival horror’ tag applied Bye Sweet Carole is somewhat misleading, as what we have is more of a classic point and click adventure game mixed with some underwhelming platforming and stealth horror sections. The adventure side of things is well designed and features some really nice puzzles that offer enough challenge to keep your interest without becoming frustrating. The exception to this is a late game puzzle involving time travel and growing a seed, where the dialog prompts led me to believe that the game had broken – a sentiment shared by many in the Steam forums. You’ll spend the game exploring the interior and surroundings of Bunny Hall looking for keys, switching levers and using your ability to change into a rabbit to navigate tight spaces. Progression is well paced and this part of the game remains enjoyable throughout.</p>
<p>Where the game falls down, however, is in the platforming and stealth parts. Lana feels quite stiff to control and it is very easy to slip from a platform and die. Her rabbit form is far more nimble, though, and to be honest I switched to it whenever I was able to. Then there are numerous ledges that require you to balance using the left stick that go on for too long, whilst instadeath stealth sections often feel more random than designed. The latter are very common, although many can be avoided by simply running away. You can hide in lockers and hold the left trigger to hold your breath, but this mechanic is never particularly engaging and feels tacked on.</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me, however, was the enforced stealth sections that reminded me of Dragon’s Lair for all the wrong reasons, as they felt arbitrary as to whether you would be spotted or not. These were generally being preceded by unskippable cutscenes, which made me resent them even more. I think the idea of blending adventure and action is an interesting one, but the balance here is just off.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Bye Sweet Carole is a curate’s egg of a game, with the presentation being truly superb and the storytelling excellent, but the bulk of the game experience just isn’t fun. The frustrating platforming and stealth, combined with the review build being quite buggy, led to me finishing the game with gritted teeth rather than enjoyment. The bugs can be fixed (and the devs are working on patches) but the imbalance between the two gameplay styles is a more fundamental issue. If you can see past this then the game has a lot to offer in terms of aesthetic and story but, ironically, these can be enjoyed through watching a playthrough without subjecting yourself to the frustration.	</p></div>
