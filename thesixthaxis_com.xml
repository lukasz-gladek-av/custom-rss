		<p>It appears yet another previously announced game has got the chop by Microsoft with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k">Jason Schreier from Bloomber</a>g reporting that Avalanche Studio’s Contraband has been cancelled.</p>
<p>That has just been confirmed by Avalanche, although they say development has stopped whilw they “evaluate” the project’s future.</p>



<p>Announced during the 2021 Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase with a CGI trailer for the game and&nbsp; very little else.&nbsp; The official version of the reveal trailer has been removed for YouTube, but here’s a copy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraband. Teaser 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/71hMe-XsYx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Contraband is our most ambitious game yet and working closely together with Xbox Games Studios has been a great experience,” said Omar Shakir, Game Director at Avalanche Studios at the to,e. “We can’t wait to share more about the game and the world of Bayan.”</p>

<p>“We’re incredibly excited to work together with a partner such as Xbox Game Studios and look forward to laying the foundation for a long-standing partnership,” added Pim Holfve, CEO at Avalanche Studios Group. “With Contraband, we’re taking everything we’ve learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities.”</p>
<p>Some leaks did hit the internet over the past few years, it was said to be a mix of PayDay, Battlefield Hardline, Mad Max, and Dukes of Hazard. It was going to be a four and eight player co-op and seemed to pit a team of cops against a team of robbers who are trying to pull off a heist.</p>
<p>A QA tester posted this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZxS5WZ_Es">YouTube</a></p>
<p>“I was one of the first employed QA Testers to experience the game and even in the early stages it was hella fun. As of my last experience the vehicles were fully customizable. You could slap on giant off road tires on what looked like a typical 60s muscle car. You also could get covered in mud and even stuck. Though my personal favourite was the land rover style vehicle. It could go anywhere, really fast and could boost plus at the time had a winch. Basically take all the awesome vehicle driving and customization in Mad Max and put it in the game for the vehicle missions.”</p>
<p>“The island design will be super clean. There was talk about licensed music but they already had a lot of music that you would expect to hear in the 70s in south east asia. The main story had four female protagonists and was the main selling point of the game at the time. So I can confirm that it will be four player. Not sure about the eight player but we did have that as an option, we just didn’t have enough people to test it out. When I mean I was one of the first testers, I’m not joking, the team was only four people, a QA Lead, Test Engineer and two testers.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gearbox has put the spotlight on the beefcakiest of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> Vault Hunters, Amon the Forgeknight, showing off the character’s axe chucking abilities and role as the frontline tank of the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Amon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lCbxjy0zI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Forgeknight, Amon can draw upon drones to quickly craft the weapons and gear that he needs. This includes a Forgehammer to smash enemies with, Forgeaxes to throw at and slice enemies, a Forgeshield to soak up damage, and more.</p>
<p>These Action Skillsdepend on which of the three skill trees you’ve levelled up, though, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree) – Wield the elemental might of fire and ice with Amon’s twin Forgeaxes, which deal Incendiary or Cryo damage by default, have multiple charges, and can be picked up to reduce their cooldown. The Forgeaxes make any damaged target Primed, causing them to explode in a damaging, bloody mess when killed.</li>
<li>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree) – Charge headlong into the fray as Amon summons his Forgeshield, which will soak up incoming damage and fill up a Vengeance Meter. Once you’ve absorbed the brunt of the incoming hurt, you can return the favor by firing back a Forgewave that consumes Vengeance to deal freezing Cryo damage.</li>
<li>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree) – Wallop your foes in the face with Amon’s Forgefist, which dashes to your target to unleash an explosive Rocket Punch. The force of this Incendiary Melee Damage impact will Stagger most enemies, leaving them dazed so you can finish them off with a flurry of bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/amon/">view each tree in depth here</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. Amon’s Forgeskill trait gives him a secondary Action Skill, which comes with a separate cooldown, so you can really bounce back and forth between them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped) – Throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing Cryo Damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing Incendiary Melee Damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped) – Deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and velocity. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active, and enemies near Firewall get burned with Incendiary damage over time.</li>
<li>Molten Slam (Onslaughter Action Skill equipped) – Slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing Incendiary damage to enemies in a large area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amon is the third character that Gearbox has released a deep dive on, following on from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/vex-spotlight/">Vex the Siren</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/rafa-spotlight/">Rafa the Exo-Soldier.</a> There’s just Harlowe the Gravitar to go, which will doubtless be coming soon, what with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">Borderlands 4’s release date being set for 12th September</a>. There’s not much time left!</p>
