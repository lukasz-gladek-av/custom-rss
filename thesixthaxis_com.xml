		<p>While it’s only actually been a shade over 8 years since the release of Killing Floor 2, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s the same 70 years that have passed in the story for Killing Floor 3. Time has hop, skipped and jumped decades into the future, and it’s as dystopian as ever, with Horzine creating a new army of Zeds and just a small scrappy bunch of resistance fighters called Nightfall ready to oppose them. I’ve honestly no idea what Horzine could possibly gain from destroying the world, but it does seem fairly on brand for the human race.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with a closed beta of the game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">ahead of a wider beta test next week</a>, sinking back into the renewed, but familiar horde shooter. The essential format will be familiar to fans of Killing Floor and the genre in general. Your team of up to six allies will drop into a map and face off against increasingly fearsome waves of Zeds, building up to a final boss battle. It’s really a case of picking your battlegrounds, making use of both the map layout to try and funnel enemies into (re)killing zones, and using environmental elements from basic doors to turrets, giant fans and vats of molten metal to your advantage, triggering things at just the right time to do as much damage as possible.</p>



<p>Survive a round, and you can race over to a designated vendor station to spend dosh you’ve just earned on weapon upgrades and gear restocks to help you survive what the next round holds.</p>

<p>There’s a few great quirks here. Visiting a vendor also completely recharges your character’s Gadget, the special ability that comes on a cooldown and generally lets you fire off one, maybe two times per round. With a vendor recharge, there’s no reason not to use the gadget as often as possible, picking those late round moments when the heaviest Zeds are turning up and you need to do as much damage or healing as possible.</p>
<p>The vendor location is also always dragging you off to a new part of the map, aiding in the variety of the battles you’ll face –&nbsp;though obviously you can keep on the move and kite enemies if things start to look a bit desperate. While your chosen class will have a set of weapons designed for them – the medic, for example, has a beam cannon that can heal allies and charge itself from enemies – you’re actually free to purchase any weapon from any class. If a run needs you to have more firepower than healing, then you can grab one of the launchers and lay down additional explosions.</p>

<p>That range of weapons also ties in to the overarching player progression. Each of the six characters has a particular role – Obi is the healer, coming with a pistol that can shoot restorative darts from range, the Sanctum field projector that can heal allies within its bubble, and has purchasable weapons that can also keep your team going. Devlin is the Firebug, who brings fire and explosive weapons intended for crowd control, while Foster has a drone that fires acid attacks, and Nakata is very much a ‘rule of cool’ kind of character, turning up to a zombie apocalypse with a suite of ninja swords, bows and grappling hooks.</p>
<p>Each of them has thirty levels of progression, unlocking boosts and abilities in the categories of Passive, Throwable and Gadget. You’ll likely end up picking one character and role as your main, but it definitely won’t hurt to level up an alternate, even if just for a change of pace.</p>
<p>No matter the character and class, you’ll be fending off the hordes of Zeds that have been giving even more of a sci-fi look, melding horrifying flesh with metal, morphing the human form in frankly gross ways. There’s also returning and reimagined special Zeds, such as the series’ staple Fleshpound and Scrake – both of them big lad with spiky gauntlets or chainsaw hands that will take a lot of killing – or the screaming Siren – now with an extendable neck, for some reason – and then the intimidatingly large bosses that are an violent capstone to any mission. The Impaler rampages around with a giant Rhino-like horn coming out of its forehead, as just one example.</p>

<p>They all still gib, though, and this is better and gorier than ever. Tripwire has leant in on Unreal Engine 5 here, fuelling the moody lighting and atmosphere of each map, while the power of modern machines has allowed them to ramp up the number of Zeds spawned at any one time. Tie this together with the new M.E.A.T. system – I don’t know what it stands for, but it’s a convenient backronym, if ever there was one – and there’s tons of dismemberment and persistent blood and gore that will be splattered across the world.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design. It also seems that Tripwire are in this for the long haul, just as they were before, with plans to support this game for years after its launch on 25th March, just as they did for the earlier games in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to play before then, well, there’s another beta scheduled to take place next week from 20th to 24th February, giving players a chance to sample the co-op action horror for themselves.</p>

			<p>The long-running debate over video games as art is fortunately mostly a thing of the past, though it’s often up to indie games to help prop up any arguments that still rage. Obviously what makes a game – or any piece of media – art is a complex and largely subjective issue. You might point to the aesthetic approach, the narrative, or the interplay between presentation and mechanics. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes ticks all of these boxes and is perhaps the closest you’ll get to arthouse cinema in modern gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="LORELEI AND THE LASER EYES | Coming to PlayStation December 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcnwQKFgbds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The aesthetic of Lorelei is immediately striking, with its largely monochromatic palette clearly echoing the golden age of black and white movies. The minimalistic artstyle manages to be both retro and timeless, generally doing so without generally relying on aping the pixelated or polygonal graphics of bygone eras.</p>


<p>Much of Lorelei takes place in relative quiet, with your explorations being accompanied mostly by the loud echo of your footsteps. Whilst much of the soundtrack is little more than an ambient drone, there are some memorable tunes to be heard with Radio Waves and the title track being particular standouts.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Lorelei feels like a fusion of survival horror and Myst-like puzzles, but with a more mathematical turn. You explore a mysterious mansion with a multitude of locked doors and incongruous mechanisms, but there is no weaponry or combat to be found here. Initially your exploration is very limited and linear, but as you progress you’ll find a series of shortcut doors that require specific mathematical or logical puzzles to be solved. The maths here is more along the lines of pattern recognition rather than complex sums or algebra that would have you breaking out graph paper and a graphical calculator, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t simplified an equation for a few years. Every face button has the same function, which is perhaps my only real complaint – the lack of a quick back button to exit the inventory menu soon becomes a little irritating.</p>
<p>The various rooms of Lorelei’s mansion contain a dizzying number of documents and notes that serve as clues for the puzzles you’ll encounter. Whilst items are mostly restricted to keys (and objects that work as keys) you’ll be referring to your notes constantly. Despite the easy access to your file of documents, I also made extensive use of pen and paper to plot out ideas, possible answers to riddles and make notes of shapes and patterns. This aspect really brought me back to a much older style of gaming, as well as making the game a fantastically engaging form of impromptu multiplayer with my teenage children. Only one person can control what happens, but the puzzles really come into their own with multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>The narrative of Lorelei is as labyrinthine as the mansion in which it takes place. You play as a young Lorelei who must explore the home of her much older self and unravel the mysteries of her life. The game is closely intertwined with visual art, classic cinema, and screenwriting and the end result is a fascinating mixture of media that manages to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>It even manages to engage with the history of gaming with one subquest involving a haunted PS1-era game – the one time that the game does lean in on retro polygonal graphics – which you enter and have to deliberately glitch out following clues hidden in the documents found around the house. This is a perfect example of the multi-layered nature of the puzzles in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. There are some small standalone moments but much of the game is magnificently interwoven. I’m hoping to find time to play through it again in order to unpick the twists and turns in the narrative soon.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lorelei is one of the best puzzle adventures in recent years and deserves to be spoken about on the same level as the likes of Zork and Myst. On the surface it feels like an arthouse take on survival horror, but the depth and complexity of its narrative, combined with the superb puzzles and uniquely stylish aesthetic makes this a modern-day classic.	</p></div>
