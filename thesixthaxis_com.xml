			<p>The elevator pitch for Skydance’s Behemoth promises you one thing: huge battles against behemoths. Enemies the size of skyscrapers that you have to dodge, climb, and eventually stab in just the right spot to bring down. It’s Shadow of the Colossus except in VR, with you doing the actual climbing motions yourself. It sounds like a perfect fit, and fighting them is as entertaining as you’d expect… except you only get to get to do so a handful of times. The rest of the game has you&nbsp;fighting human enemies, exploring levels, and solving puzzles, which is a bit less exciting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLjFsZAHuJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’ve played a combat focused VR game before, you’ll have an idea of what to expect from the person to person combat – scabbards on each hip and shoulder allow you to carry and switch between a variety of weapons ranging from standard swords, axes, shields, and bows through to giant, Cloud Strife-sized swords and yet another sword that can be re-summoned after throwing. Make no mistake, you are a very dangerous person in this game and that’s before you take into account the powers that you’ll quickly acquire, such as super strength that, when activated, lets you pick up whole enemies and throw them around, punch through damaged walls, and more.</p>


<p>Clearly the game gives you a lot of tools and you will use them in conjunction with a parry/riposte system to fight your way through levels in search of the behemoth. There’s more than enemies to contend with though, as there’s also the dreaded stamina bar-based climbing which, provided you glance at what you need to do first and keep the pace up, isn’t really an issue. You’ll also quickly find a wrist mounted grappling hook that allows you to pull, swing, and zip up to things, not to mention pulling enemies towards you during combat. It doesn’t take long before you’re doing typical platformer things like grappling between points without landing. Except in VR!</p>


<p>The only problem is that it’s all a bit too easy. The puzzles in particular are very simplistic and feel especially laborious when you’re the actual person dragging giant blocks around. The combat is a bit easy as well, only really raising its difficulty when you reach a boss, whether that’s a beefed up human or behemoth. It doesn’t bother you too much whilst you’re playing, because the moment-to-moment fighting is so much fun, but after a battle it tends to feel like it was over too quickly. Even the enemies with lengthy health bars are a bit too easy once you’ve got a handle on the parry system. Then it’s just a case of working down their health until their helmet pops off so you can stab them in the face. Lovely.</p>
<p>I do enjoy the staging of things throughout – one battle with an archer boss had arrows hit a save point as you’re using it, with a dramatic pause waiting for you to turn around to continue the encounter. It feels like the kind of melodrama you expect in medieval fantasy. Outside of moments like this the story itself isn’t particularly engrossing, but it’s good enough to keep you going at least and the voice acting sells it well enough.</p>

<p>Now we come to the behemoths. Yep, they’re actually that big and they look even bigger in VR, especially when you’re clinging to their ankles. These go too far the other way in terms of difficulty, and I found that there was a bit of trial and error involved in defeating them – obviously error means death. Sometimes it took a while before I noticed a weak point or climbable part, which makes you feel like an idiot when really, you just couldn’t see it from where you were or it wasn’t shining like usual for some reason. Outside of this, though, they’re thrilling. The build up to the behemoths is good as well – one of my favourite moments comes in the run up to the second behemoth, a large bat like creature. It’s hanging in front of you silhouetted so you don’t notice it in the environment until it unfurls its wings and roars before flying upwards through the cavern you’re entering. It’s just great.</p>
<p>The game runs flawlessly on PSVR 2 and looks good, if not great. It controls well enough most of the time, though there can be a bit of awkwardness around sheathing weapons as is typical in VR. Activating the super strength is a bit inconsistent as well – sometimes I thought I had done it but it hadn’t triggered for some reason and others it wouldn’t register me hitting a wall with it activated, which caused it to run out and forced me to wait for the cooldown. I also found that aiming with a bow would sometimes cause the bow to wiggle slightly with the hand tracking, which isn’t great for aiming really.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately Behemoth is a good VR combat game that's a bit too easy, and with its impressively huge boss battles too few in number. Whilst the combat and exploration is enjoyable enough, the puzzling is too simple and, in a game about killing giants, you'd expect there to be a few more giants.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-30-to-26.1074633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>
