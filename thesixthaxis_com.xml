		<p>During the State of Unreal conference today, CD Projekt RED showed a tech demo of The Witcher 4, and one of the most impressive things about is that this tech demo is running on a base PS5 at 60fps with raytracing. With this being a demo and the The Witcher 4 still in early development, this does not necessarily mean the final product will hit those same benchmarks.</p>

<p>The demo shows us a first look at Ciri in action as well as the region of Kovir, mentioned in previous games and in the books, but this is the first time players will be able to explore the region. We are also introduced to Ciri’s horse, Kelpie, her pure black horse who seems to have a bit more personality than Geralt’s Roach. The new Unreal Engine 5.6 update adds some new things to the experience too, including nanite foliage and character motion matching so horse riding, for example, comes across as much more lifelike.</p>
<p>The world of The Witcher 4 is much more responsive to Ciri’s actions as well. In one part she bumps into someone carrying a box of apples. The person drops some apples, a child and some pigs notice, and run up to gather the fallen apples. The clip goes on to show larger crowds gathered in a market square to watch a performance, all fitting into the game without sacrificing the 60 fps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> was revealed in December with confirmation that Ciri would take the role of the lead protagonist. All we know is that this is the start of a new era for The Witcher series and it is set in Kovir. We do not have any details yet as to what has taken Ciri to Kovir or which characters will be returning in this sequel. A release date has not been confirmed either.</p>

		<p>Never Ends, a brand new tactical RPG, has been announced by developer Hypersect with the game set to be released for PC via Steam, and PlayStation consoles later this year. The game has developers with some major experience under their belts, including designer Masayoshi Nishimura who has worked on Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy, director Ryan Juckett who was the lead sandbox level designer for Destiny, and muscian Doseone who has worked on Enter The Gungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Never's End | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkBd9ygZg8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Our collective influences from tactical RPGs like&nbsp;Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tactics Ogre&nbsp;came together to spark a grander idea,”</em> said Ryan Juckett, founder of Hypersect. <em>“Never’s End&nbsp;fleshes out turn-based tactics combat with reactive systems empowering players to co-author the story and make it their own, which is a feeling we loved in&nbsp;Divinity: Original Sin 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Together with Nishimura-san, Doseone, and&nbsp;you, we’re excited to finally get to show you all just how memorable this forgotten world can be.”</em></p>
<p>The story of Never Ends puts players in the role of an immortal warrior who is defending the last human settlement, as the rest of the world has succumbed to a force known as the Never. Players will be able to wield elements like fire and water, and put together a team of warriors to fight enemies in tactical turn based battles. As progress is made, players can restore the world of Never Ends by reviving locations, towns, businesses, and trade routes. Doing so will give access to new party members who can help in the fight.</p>

<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Never Ends.</p>
