		<p>I’ve definitely felt the nights drawing in this week, and so what better way to embody that in gaming form than with a cosy, witchy puzzle game like Strange Antiquities? Or… clumsy walking simulator Baby Steps? They’re definitely on opposite ends of the gaming spectrum, and only one of them saw me spend around an hour mastering the ability to climb up a slick, muddy hill, and repeatedly slide all the way back down to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has easily had the most exciting week of the lot of us, as he’s flown out to Japan for Tokyo Game Show, getting to go hands on with a bunch of upcoming games –&nbsp;he’s obviously been most excited for Monster Hunter – as well as just soak in the atmosphere and explore Chiba. He even went to a baseball game!</p>

<p>For the next best thing, <strong>Aran</strong> has finally been able to dish out our review of Ghost of Yotei – I still haven’t learnt the key combo to type the special o – and he’s absolutely loved his time with Sucker Punch’s second Japanese adventure. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Read his review here</a>, but he’s already moved on to EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>It’s been a big blend of Dying Light: The Beast, the Atomfall DLC The Red Strain, Discounty, Rise of Industry, and Blippo+ for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, as he reviewed a whole host of things, while <strong>Nic</strong> was a bit more focused and just reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gameplay-trailer-released/">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> – was it thrice as nice as the original PS1 release?</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> and his “fiancé/gaming pal” Laura have been playing the rogue ’em up Absolum for review this week.</p>
<p>Looking for something new to play, <strong>Jim</strong> settled on The Forgotten City, the former Skyrim mod spun out into its own fully-fledged detective sim set during the Roman era. “I was honestly quite surprised how effortlessly it drew me in, being one of the few games to nail a smart and satisfying time loop mechanic.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> hasn’t actually played any games, but has handed in a stinging TV review. “Alien Earth is so, so, so stupid it defies belief,” he says. “I binge-watched all 20 episodes of Celebs Go Dating, and it was much better than Alien Earth because people acted like people with brains, and given that Kerry Katona and a Love Islander are on the show, that’s saying a lot.”</p>
<p>And this whole What We Played is a TGS sandwich, as <strong>Miguel</strong> is also out in Japan. However, on the flight out he was only able to play things in 20 minute chunks, because he couldn’t keep his eyes open for longer through the air on the plane. He’s going to get eyedrops and play more of Megabonk, Is This Seat Taken, Fumes, and some Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on the trip home, though.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played? And have you been in Japan?</p>
