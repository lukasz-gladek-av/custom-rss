<p>MachineGames Audio Director, Pete Ward, guides us on this tour through the first person action adventure. While there’s some new clips and things to see, it’s fair to say that this video covers a fair bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-action-puzzles-exploration-disguises/">familiar ground from previous trailers,</a> including the figure of Tony Todd as a mysterious and very imposing antagonist right at the start of the game – who sadly passed away age 69 last week, making this game a posthumous appearance – and the companion character, photojournalist Gina, who teams up with Indy on the chase after Emmerich Voss who’s on a global hunt for otherworldly artefacts.</p>
<p>Indy has a camera of his own, using it to take photos of the world as you adventure, potentially getting clues from Indy as you do so. This fills in Indy’s journal, which will track the adventure so far and all the clips. You might also have to get your Agent 47 on with some disguises to get into restricted areas.</p>

<p>I got to go hands on with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle last month, and had a rather good time. Playing in first person (with a few snippets of third person) might be different from what you’d expect, given that Indiana Jones inspired the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, but it works. I said, “I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!”</p>

		<p>Crowbar Collective, the creative team behind the Half Life remake Black Mesa, has announced with Team 17 its new rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter. This new game is called Rogue Point, and it is set in a word where the world conglomerates wage war against each other after the passing of the world’s richest CEO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this corporate war, players are not one of the many groups employed by these conglomerates. Instead, players form up a team of independent vigilantes who go after these mercenary groups, known as MERX, in attempt to bring an end the power struggle between the corporations.</p>
<p>Ann Hurley, General Manager, Team17 Digital, said, “<em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with FPS veterans,</em><em>&nbsp;Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.”</em></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels said, “<em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter,&nbsp;Rogue&nbsp;Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of&nbsp;Black Mesa&nbsp;and having Team 17 as a partner for&nbsp;Rogue Point&nbsp;helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em>”</p>

<p>Rogue Point’s campaign will be dynamic so no playthrough will be the same, due to how the mission structures and designs change. The missions themselves are set in four different locations. Players will be able to equip various types of weapons and equipment, along with campaign modifiers which all add to the dynamism of Rogue Point. Changing weapons and equipment will be necessary as different MERX groups are divided into classes with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>At the moment, it appears Rogue Point is on PC via Steam only and a release date is to be confirmed.</p>
