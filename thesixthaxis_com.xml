		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/sony-strikes-business-alliance-with-kadokawa-will-hold-largest-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-copmany/</link>

		<p>Sony has made a big investment in FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa, forming a new capital and business alliance through the acquisition by Sony of a 10% stake in the media conglomerate. This includes shares previously purchased by Sony in 2021.</p>
<p>Sony President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said, “Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.'”</p>


<p>While all the buzz here is about Sony getting closer ties to FromSoftware – mainly because a prospective Bloodborne remaster has become something of an internet meme – Kadokawa’s media empire is much, much broader than that. In game development they are the parent to Acquire and Spike Chunsoft, they also have an array of Japanese film-making companies, from animation to post-production localisation, and a books and manga arm as well.</p>
<p>This will be as much about games as it is about extending Sony’s reach within anime and other media – Kadokawa holds over 100,000 IP that can be tapped in various ways. Sony already has a near monopoly on global anime distribution, thanks to buying both Funimation and Crunchyroll in the past decade and combining the two, but now seems to be looking to gain more of the means of production, as it were.</p>

<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/sony-kadokawa-fromsoftware-elden-ring-bloodborne/">rumours and public statements that Sony was exploring a wholesale acquisition of Kadokawa</a> – reports were that Kadokawa wanted either a complete buyout or for Sony to leave them alone,&nbsp;though it’s not clear whether those reports were a slight exaggeration of the actual negotiations or if they’ve compromised to this investment.</p>
