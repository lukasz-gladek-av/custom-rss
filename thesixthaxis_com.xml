		<p>EA have dropped an impressive trailer for the single player campaign of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6/"> Battlefield 6</a>, which is out this October.</p>
<p>“After the War Stories episode structure of Battlefield 1 and Battlefield V, Battlefield 6 is a return to a singular narrative, one that has you fighting battles across three continents. During this campaign, you’ll fight a tank battle under the shadows of the Pyramids, take to the streets of Brooklyn for intense gunfights, perform a HALO jump into enemy territory, and more in this modern military thriller,” explains EA’s Roman Campos-Oriola, Creative Director for the singe player game.</p>

<p>You will as the members of Dagger 13, an elite Marine Raiders unit. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Haz Carter</strong>: a former high school quarterback who chose the rugged allure of the wilderness over being a sports star. During his time in the Marines, Haz was recognized for his blend of athletic prowess and survival skills, ultimately joining the Marine Raiders, rising to become an&nbsp;<strong>Assault&nbsp;</strong>expert and the leader of the squad.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Murphy</strong>: a warfighter who chose the frontlines over an officer’s career, Murphy’s courage and strategic thinking make him a vital member of Dagger as the team’s&nbsp;<strong>Engineer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Simone “Gecko” Espina</strong>: Gecko learned to be a hunter on her grandfather’s farm and carried her expertise at tracking and taking on the elements into her military career. An adrenaline fanatic, Gecko became a Special Forces Operator. As the newest member of Dagger, she’s ready to prove herself as the squad’s&nbsp;<strong>Recon&nbsp;</strong>expert.</p>
<p><strong>Cliff Lopez</strong>: Rejecting his parents’ wishes for him to go to med school, Lopez sought glory and adventure on the field of battle. Lopez wears his heart on his sleeve and as the squad’s&nbsp;<strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;is an essential member of the team.</p>
<p><strong>Lucas Hemlock</strong>: A CIA Operator with a largely redacted past, all most people know about Hemlock is that he’s a true patriot to the end and is willing to do anything for his country.</p>

		<p>Surprising literally nobody, Flight Simulator 2024 has been announced for PlayStation 5, the latest Xbox exclusive to breach the previous platform divide. The game will arrive on PS5 on 8th December 2025, while PSVR 2 support is also in development for a later date.</p>

<p>Flight Simulator 2024, launched for Xbox and PC at the end of last year, an overhauled successor to the 2020 Flight Simulator, building on the same rendering of the real world that you can fly around, but building in a career mode, more missions, from Search and Rescue to tourism, agricultural crop dusting, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s a great simulator, but I think I’m most intrigued to see how PSVR 2 support looks on console, as the game is pretty heavy to run.</p>

		<p>Housemarque and Sony have released a chunky five minutes of gameplay for the upcoming looper shooter roguelike Saros – the sequel to Returnal. The team have confirmed that Saros is coming to PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> on 20th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | September 24, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QcEoGC51ZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet Carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony which is repeatedly being destroyed by way and the death of the planet’s sun. He’s a bit chattier, it seems, as he has an AI companion, and hunt down Soltari datalog vaults to reveal more of the game’s story.</p>
<p>The gameplay structure will sound pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of Returnal, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Second Chance is one of he permanent progression features, able to revive Arjun on his first death to immediately throw him back into the action of a particular run.</p>
<p>The video built up to the reveal of a big many-armed boss, with many more snippets of titanic gameplay to round things out.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>
