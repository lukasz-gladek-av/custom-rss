		<p>Redemption Road Games has delayed Kingmakers just before its anticipated early access release date of October 8th, and the studio has not stated when the game is now expected to release. This is the second delay for Kingmakers, which was originally scheduled for early access in Q1 2025. If you need a refresher of what Kingmakers is, it is a game where you go 500 years back in time, fighting in a medieval battle to change the course of history using modern weapons and tech.</p>

<p>In a statement, Redemption Road Games said, <em>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch of October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating the game. We are sorry for letting you down. Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</em></p>
<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles, where every room can be entered, and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore- with or without their thousands of soldiers. We set out to do all of this, with full drop in/drop out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So this is what we’re doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top of the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days. Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it. We will be presenting a half hour long deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.”</em></p>

		<p>Yacht Club Games has announced that it is delaying Mina The Hollower, with the developer stating that the game will not be ready to release by October 31st. The delay is not expected to be too long, but Yacht Club Games is not going to commit to a new release date until it has been submitted to platforms and gone through all the necessary steps.</p>

<p>In a statement, Yacht Club Games wrote,<em>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine. With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line. The game is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalizing design, art, and sound</em></li>
<li><em>Overall game balancing</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing localization</em></li>
<li><em>Eating cheese</em></li>
<li><em>Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you for your understanding and patience.”</em></p>

<p>Mina The Hollower was announced three years ago and is an action adventure game that has used the Game Boy 8 bit aesthetic as inspiration. Mina is a mouse, a whip-wielding inventor that uses this signature weapon for attacking enemies, and to whip walls and items in the world to destroy and manipulate them. The game is expected to release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, XS, Xbox One, Switch and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the past couple of weeks has been Skate. If you’ve been around gaming for a while – which I, ahem, have – then you’ll know Skate from the days of the Xbox 360 and PS3, where it went board to board with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater by offering a completely different take on the sport and the skateboarding scene. Many had assumed that Skate 3 – released 15 whole years ago – was the end for the series, especially with the shuttering of developer EA Black Box, but just like any skateboarder whose face has felt the cool touch of tarmac, you can’t keep a good game series down. The new version of Skate ten, has just arrived in Early Access, and with the launch of Season One today, the team at Full Circle have announced that the game has already seen 15 million players hitting the sidewalks of San Vansterdam.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a hell of a lot of people. And with good reason too, since the move to Free-To-Play has made this the most accessible skateboarding game we’ve ever had. Even if you only have the most passing interest in skateboarding – perhaps you watched Lords of Dogtown with Heath Ledger in back in the day and thought it was pretty cool – there’s literally no reason not to download the new Skate and check it out. That certainly seems to be what people are doing too, as the player numbers have soared in only three weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve spent some serious time in San Vansterdam already, and really enjoyed this initial foray into Early Access in my review, stating, “I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community are already in place, the only thing missing is you.”</p>
<p><em>Season 1 launches today with all-new skateable areas, Challenges, Tasks, seasonal events, new brand partners, cosmetics, quality of life improvements and more.</em></p>
