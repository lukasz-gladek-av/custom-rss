			<p>It feels like ages since I’ve played a proper Japanese dungeon-crawler. Back in the 3DS and PS Vita era, we were spoiled for choice – a new&nbsp;<em>Etrian Odyssey&nbsp;</em>entry was always around the corner, the&nbsp;<em>Persona Q&nbsp;</em>spinoffs were coming out at a steady clip, and there was a horde of dungeon crawlers to choose from on the iconic PlayStation handheld. As the visual and content expectations for modern games has grown, it’s kind of outpaced the lo-fi and scrappy nature of a traditional first-person dungeon crawler. The only reason I’m diving into a new one now, that title being&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster,&nbsp;</em>is because it’s an updated release and first-time localisation of a game that came out over 15 years ago. Diving into it now is a delightful blast from the past that I had no idea I was in such dire need of.</p>
<p>youtube.com/watch?v=kzICEVJisBU&amp;themeRefresh=1</p>
<p><em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> is a dungeon-crawler RPG that’s set against a school-setting backdrop. When you boot the game up, you’re given three different schools to choose from for your playthrough. While the flavour text makes it seem like this is just an aesthetic choice, the ramifications here are surprisingly huge. Your starting school not only dictates your character uniforms, but it also entirely changes the region you start in, the teachers you train with, the roles your characters can take on, and the quests you’re doing. </p>


<p>These changes in quests and locations also inherently lead to major differences in difficulty across the 3 schools. It’s a surprisingly inventive approach to “difficulty settings” that feels akin to the way an MMO will give you different starting regions based on your chosen race – and it’s something I’m surprised more games haven’t done.</p>
<p>Once you’re enrolled in school, the loop of the game is deceptively simple. You’ve got some barebones narrative reasons for going out into an escalating series of dungeons. As you explore, you’ll level up your characters, get money and materials to acquire new gear, run into incredibly difficult monsters, and acquire more levels and more gear until those monsters are milquetoast. Much like the&nbsp;<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>series, this game is built around giving you a sandbox to grind in, a massive amount of gear and unlockables to grind for, and leaving you to your own devices. As a result, it’s an incredibly love-it-or-hate-it kind of game.</p>


<p>Some quality-of-life features you might expect from a JRPG, for example, are entirely absent here – but they’re kind of absent on purpose. Battles can be repetitive and lengthy, yet there’s no way to speed them up or automatically squash lower-level foes. For a masochistic dungeon-crawler fan, that’s music to your ears. But if you’re someone who ends up bouncing off that kind of purposefully repetitive dungeoneering, there isn’t much else on offer in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> to occupy your time or make those encounters any less taxing. </p>
<p>One refreshing feature is the ability to swap your character classes at any time. This doesn’t lead to any sort of exciting dual-class or skill-inheritance systems, though – you can no longer use abilities from your previous class once you swap to a new one. Still, it’s nice to be able to make the mistake of leveling a class that isn’t working out for you and have an instant way to remedy that without feeling like that character is useless now.</p>

<p>Additionally, there’s a fun relationship-chart system in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> that I appreciated a lot. As you build your adventuring party, you’re also tasked with setting up a connective web of relationships between all of them and deciding which characters like each other or dislike each other. These connections can lead to buffs or debuffs in battle, and often times one character liking a different one can lead to another person in the party having negative feelings for someone as a result. </p>
<p>It’s all framed like one of those relationship charts out of a bonus manga chapter, and I love how it helps add an extra layer of self-driven roleplay to the experience. One of my favorite parts of an open-ended dungeon crawler like this is getting to craft my own stories and personalities for each character, and the game giving me a tool to cook up inter-party relationships on top of that is so fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>is an incredibly simple but dauntingly dense dungeon-crawler. There’s a massive amount of classes, enemies, gear, and skills to grind for and acquire. The grind to get all of those is going to be absolutely repetitive and mechanical, but that’s the kind of thing that makes a game like this so satisfying to dump time into.</p>

		<p>MicroProse has announced that it will be publishing Darkenstein 3D, a throwback to 90s first person shooters, and that the game will be available for free from October 21st. The game has been inspired by the likes of Wolfenstein, Doom, Enemy Territory, and Quake 3, with Darkenstein 3D putting you in the boots of American drifter Hobo Guy who has somehow ended up fighting Nazis after they kidnapped his dog.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkenstein 3D | MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oorwB_xHoGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darkenstein 3D will have 13 levels to play through, a variety of weapons to use against enemies with the shotgun being the primary, fast paced combat where you need to keep moving to survive, and a rat companion that has a thirst for blood. The levels will vary in style too and include castles, deserts, bunkers and valleys to navigate and shoot your way through.</p>
<p><em>“I spent years immersed in games like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory, making maps for the latter as well as Quake 3. Darkenstein 3D is my way of bringing that same fast, chaotic energy back. It is a raw shooter that lives between the first FPS classics like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D and the modern era. Louder, bloodier, silly, and built to be played hard.”</em>&nbsp;said Rowye, creator of&nbsp;<em>Darkenstein 3D</em>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195910/Darkenstein_3D/">Darkenstein 3D demo</a> available to play on Steam, and currently it looks like the game is only going to be released on PC for now via Steam, GOG, itch.io.</p>
