		<p>Microsoft has announced a partnership with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG’s new Smart TVs, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to use it. Those who have this membership will be able to access Xbox Game Pass games through the Xbox app on LG TVs, and will not need an Xbox console. It is all part of Microsoft’s This Is an Xbox plan, which is the company’s push to show how many devices Xbox games can be played on.</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, Game Pass Ultimate players will also be able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-lets-you-stream-some-of-your-own-games/">stream their own games</a> that they own, as long as they are part of the initial 50 launch titles for the service. This service is already available on other devices. In its announcement post, Microsoft said, <em>“Today, we’re excited to announce our collaboration with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox app to their new LG Smart TVs later this year. This means Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to play their games directly from the Xbox app on supported LG Smart TVs via Xbox Cloud Gaming. This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games. Soon, players with LG Smart TVs will be able to explore the Gaming Portal for direct access to hundreds of games in the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, including popular titles such as&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and upcoming releases like&nbsp;Avowed&nbsp;(launching February 18, 2025).”</em></p>
