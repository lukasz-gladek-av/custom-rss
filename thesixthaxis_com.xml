		<p>It’s the trickier of the two clock changing weekends, with time falling back by an hour overnight and in theory giving everyone an extra hour in bed. What’s actually going to happen is that a lot of kids will still wake up at the same time, and pets are going to demand feeding an hour “early” for at least the next fortnight, which is going to see an awful lot of things knocked off shelves and tables by mardy cats.</p>
<p>Great for childless and pet-less gamers, though, who’ve got an extra hour to spend with Black Ops 6, or whatever else tickles their fancy tomorrow.</p>
