<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The events of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii take place after the story of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth concludes.</p>
<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will have ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and ship customisation. Within the Pirate Coliseum players will take part in the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio previously confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
