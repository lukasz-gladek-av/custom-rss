<p>The description for Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game says, <em>“Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a fighter rooted in the spirit of elemental mastery. Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression. Built with a focus on fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity, the game invites players to discover what it truly means to fight with purpose. Hand-drawn in 2D, it is crafted to preserve the style and expressive animation of the original series.”</em></p>
<p>As mentioned Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game will launch with 12 characters on the roster, though this roster will be expanded through a season model. Players will also be able to select support characters that will be able to provide assistance in fights, and there will be a single player story mode too. The development team also mention a movement centric “Flow System” for the gameplay. The development team also mentions cross play, and there maybe a name change as Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a working title.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new fighter for Tekken 8 Season 2, and that is Madagascan Miary Zo who will be coming to the roster this December. To be more precise, December 2nd for those with early access and available for everyone else on December 5th. Miary Zo has a bit of an advantage, as she has the powers of the fighting god, Ogre, who was killed by Jin. You can check out a five minute gameplay reveal of Miary Zo reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 — Miary Zo Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7y2eDbqONc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the gameplay trailer, you can see Miary Zo uses martial arts like capoeira and involves parkour too. In addition, Miary Zo has the ability to summon a staff to help pull off additional moves as well as use that power to use moves based upon the animals she has studied through her life to learn moves from.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick said, <em>“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</em></p>
