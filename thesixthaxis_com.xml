			<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a game I didn’t play when I was younger. I don’t know why, because I loved the first game when I was a teenager despite not really knowing what I was doing, but I just never grabbed the sequel back in the day. I did eventually venture in about two months ago, loading up the original game with a bunch of mods, and that very recent experience has me questioning why Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is really necessary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgSqwnpjxyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a CRPG built around the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 ruleset. It’s big, complex, and incredibly satisfying provided you know what you’re doing. The star here is the story and writing, which is incredibly deep and has more detail that’s just mentioned in passing than you’ll know what to do with. Starting in a village that is inevitably attacked, you recover a macguffin and are sent to the city of Neverwinter by your almost comically disinterested adoptive father. From there begins the kind of fantasy adventure you’d expect, although sometimes with enemies you might not, such as the lizardfolk which are a scourge upon your progress early on.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent game, truly a classic, but this remaster has done the absolute minimum. For one, I played this game on PC three months ago and I’m not certain there’s much of a visual difference between what I saw on my PC then and this enhanced edition. It still looks pretty dated, despite improvements to texture quality, which have counterintuitively made environments look strangely sparse. Characters fare a little better, honestly looking quite good when you’re zoomed out considering, but when you’re in conversation and the camera is zoomed all the way in, they’re still a bit rough. They’re still better than the ones in the first game and its remaster, though that’s more down to the leap in graphics tech between 2002 and 2006 than this remaster.</p>

<p>Little seems to have been done to improve the actual gameplay experience as well. There are also bugs, such as one from just the first fifteen minutes of play that forced me to repeatedly murder a villager who kept getting back up. I was supposed to beat him up a little and then he gives up and agrees to go help defend the town, but instead he continued attacking me afterwards, constantly distracting my party members so they weren’t with me when I triggered combat.</p>

<p>There’s also annoying little things wrong as well, such as having to open a door, then interact with the door again to actually use it, which is dumb on its own (just go through the door the first time!) and fiddly because positioning yourself to interact with it is awkward and the camera has a habit of suddenly zooming all the way in when I’m standing in front of a door so I can’t see. This happened on literally the first door I used.</p>
<p>As a console port of an old PC game, the controls are about what you’d expect for a keyboard and mouse game on a controller. It works just well enough that you’ll be able to put up with the awkwardness if you love the game. It’s definitely not ideal, but it does the job.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, it’s Neverwinter Nights 2 with all of its expansions playable on consoles with a controller. That’s nice. It would’ve been nicer to see some real attention given to these games to perhaps iron out some now almost twenty year old bugs and really improve things, but at least it’s playable and exactly how you remember it. For better or worse. Of course you could just play the original on PC and benefit from all the mods that have released over the years, no doubt some of which will also improve the game’s textures.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition does the bare minimum as it brings the game to consoles. It looks a bit better, but that's about it. It's still buggy and rough around the edges, but it is at least Neverwinter Nights 2. If you really want to sit back and play it with a controller, this will do it for you. If you want anything more, the original is more than playable on pretty much any PC, and has deep mod support.	</p></div>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has passed another round number milestone, as Sony has announced that they have shipped 80.3 million consoles.</p>
<p>The past quarter – ending on 30th June – saw Sony ship 2.5 million more PS5s, up from 2.4 million in the same quarter last year, which is good news for the continued appeal of the platform.&nbsp;Digging back through <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/18q2_supplement.pdf">Sony’s older financial statements</a>, the PS4 would have been at 79.6 million consoles sold by the same point in its lifetime, so the PS5 is sneaking ahead of the last generation at this point.</p>


<p>Even better, of course, is that people are still massively engaged with PlayStation gaming in general. There were 123 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network last quarter, up by seven million from the year before. Similarly, game sales for both PS5 and PS4 combined for 65.9 million games sold, up by 12.3 million from last year. Of that, 6.9 million were first party titles, and we’re now at the point where 83% of games sold are digital downloads.</p>
<p>All good stuff for Sony and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s CFO has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> is expected to release by the end of March 2026, as Bungie’s independence from PlayStation Studios is now “getting lighter”</p>
<p>The statements came from CFO Lin Tao as part of a Q&amp;A following Sony’s latest financial statements, in which she said that launch is still expected within the current fiscal year, ending on 31st March 2026. However, as this was in response to a question over what would happen if Marathon was cancelled outright, she added, “this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet.”</p>


<p>She also said, “We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation.”</p>
<p>For Bungie as a studio, there’s been plenty of speculation and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">reporting over their independence</a> and ability to operate separately from the rest of PlayStation Studios. Through 2024, the company went through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">a painful round of layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while some teams were branched off into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/sony-founds-new-studio-teamlfg-from-former-bungie-incubation-project/">separate studios</a>.</p>
<p>Tao explained Sony’s longterm plan for Bungie and that “at the time of acquisition we were offering a very independent environment, so that was one way of thinking. However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding.</p>

<p>“So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>It’s definitely concerning times for Bungie, with the launch of Destiny 2’s latest expansion, The Edge of Fate, seeming to do poorly, both from the point of sales and reaction from the game’s fanbase. Marathon was intended to be the big shining hope for the company, but the extraction shooter revamp of the studio’s mid-90s FPS series has struggled to gain traction. Having been announced for release in September, closed testing drew strong criticism such that Bungie was forced to delay the game. There was also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/bungie-pins-marathon-art-plagiarism-on-former-employee-promises-to-do-right-by-original-artist/">a whole art plagiarism scandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">a Marathon Development Update in June</a>. “We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion.”</p>
<p>It’s expected that Bungie will be able to make fresh announcements on the game this autumn.</p>
