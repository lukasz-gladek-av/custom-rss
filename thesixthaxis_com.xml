<p>The video shows how every era of Batman has been used to create Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, including the movies, TV shows, and the comic archive. The developers also give a look at how iconic moments from across Batman’s history have been used to create the story and build the city of Gotham, with lots of familiar locations. The city will have a lot going on for players to discover including areas where crimes are happening that need to be thwarted. Batman is not the sole focus of the game, with the Bat Family and rogues gallery playing an incredibly important part in proceedings.</p>
