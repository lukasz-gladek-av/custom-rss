		<p>Some brand new gameplay footage for Ghost of Yotei showing Atsu using the yari, which is a spear, to take on a group of enemies on top of a bridge. This footage seems to come at a later point in the game, as the enemy soldiers are questioning Yari if she is her, which means her legend is already starting to spread through the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Yari Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/98KGbwncmwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, the yari gives Atsu a decent advantage from range allowing her to attack enemies without them getting close. The yari can also be used to close the gap too, with footage showing Atsu using the yari to launch a kick at an enemy allowing her to close the gap and strike them down. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. The game takes us from Tsushima to Set the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603.</p>
<p>Atsu’s story is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that it’s charming looking co-op title LEGO Voyagers will be released on September 15th, and it will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. To mark the release date announcement, Annpurna Interactive has released a brand new trailer to show part of red brick’s and blue brick’s journey.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>LEGO Voyagers follows red brick and blue brick as they embark on an adventure to rescue an abandoned spaceship. Along the way the two brick friends will need to build various structures to help them get across the world, and beat the challenges that will meet them on the path. To encourage people to play together, LEGO Voyagers will have a Friend Pass. That means as long as one person owns the game, they can invite others to play with them without them needing to own LEGO Voyagers too.</p>

		<p>Have you all been a bit hot and bothered this week? It’s yet another heatwave in the UK, so sun screen, sun glasses, breezy clothing and hydration have been the order of the week.</p>
<p>But there’s always games, as well. I’ve had two reviews on the go, for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/abyssus-review/">Abyssus</a> and Drag x Drive, both of which sadly missed their potential for very different reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a> in particular missed a lot of the colourful Nintendo charm that you’d want, though the core wheelchair basketball is enjoyable.</p>

<p>Much more exciting is a trio of games that I played to experience some Gamescom previews before Gamescom, which I will be able to tell you all about next week… during Gamescom.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> was one of my Abyssus buddies, but alongside that co-op rogueliking, he played a bunch of&nbsp;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and a bit of his current gacha game favourites – Girls Frontline 2: Exilium and Zenless Zone Zero – &nbsp;and the “incredible” indie visual novel South Scrimshaw.</p>

<p>It’s also been a bit of Death Stranding for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who joined that with some Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and reviews of Sengoku Dynasty and Peglin for review.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had the cosy indie game Tiny Bookshop on the go for a review, which “is letting me live my dream.” I never knew he wanted to be a travelling book seller, but there we go!</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> thoroughly enjoyed finishing his run through DOOM: The Dark Ages, but has had plenty more on the go. He’s been playing both Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown for review, but much more concerning for his time and finances, he and his son have got into Warhammer 40,000 lately. He’s boosting his understanding of the Grimdark future by playing through Space Marine 2 a few weeks back and has now moved on to the confusingly named Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters – “a terrific XCOM type game which is proving to be great fun!”</p>
<p>Tuffcub played some of the Battlefield 6 beta last weekend “which was fun”, and has been replaying Uncharted 4. “There’s a lot of cut scenes in that game aren’t there? Does seem to drag on playing it now…”</p>
<div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755246850.156659" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755246850.156659">
<p>Having joined me for a touch of Abyssus – “which was briney fun albeit with some toxic banter from the editor… and a lot of Terry turrets” – <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with some of the bosses in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and making a start on a Switch 2 game which he’ll tell you about in due course.</p>
</div>

<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> popping off on holiday today, but has preceded this with a busy week of gaming that has included Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, Donkey Kong Bananza, Grounded 2,&nbsp;Is This Seat Taken?, and a spot of Madden too. What will he manage to play while he’s away?</p>
<p>But we’ll leave that question hanging in order to ask another. What have&nbsp;<em>you</em> played?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Rematch Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/15/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review.1270845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Options are never a bad thing. Over the years, different peripheral manufacturers have made sure that console makers can never rest on their laurels, often besting and improving on the official controller designs by adding extra features or updating the technology within them. The new wireless Turtle Beach Rematch controller focuses more on providing a similar experience to the Switch Pro Controller, while cutting into Nintendo’s fairly steep asking price. In this case, however, it’s not a steep enough price cut for the reduction in quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Rematch Wireless" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gqWyLu0VDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve loved many of Turtle Beach’s most recent controllers, from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a> to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Stealth Pivot</a>. They’re doing things differently and bringing new features to bear that have a real-world use case. The Rematch slightly glows in the dark. Fundamentally, its looks are its best feature, with its green and purple Mario-toting livery very pleasing to the eye, and certainly bright enough to stand out next to all those bland black and grey controllers you’ll find elsewhere. The glow-in-the-dark effect isn’t really bright enough to warrant its inclusion, and it’s not applied to the buttons, which are, surely, the most important thing you’d want to glance at in the dark.</p>


<p>The top shell is made from a great-feeling soft-touch plastic, to lift the experience somewhat, but the lightly-textured purple underside doesn’t carry that through, and you get two, very different, sensations when you’re holding the controller in your hands.</p>


<p>Designed with the original Switch in mind, the Rematch works with both of Nintendo’s consoles, though it lacks the Switch 2’s C button for opening up GameChat. That’s not the biggest problem when it’s accessible via the central menu, but it’s odd to release it at the same time as the Switch 2 without the new console’s full functionality. For all that it feels like an omission, that’s balanced out by an impressive 40 hours of battery life, which makes the Rematch a very easy controller to live with.</p>
<p>The most immediately gratifying aspect of the Rematch are its well-tuned analogue sticks. They feel great in use, with a nice level of tautness, and a quick return to centre. Now, that’s balanced with the disappointing fact that these are not Hall Effect or TMR type sticks, meaning they’re using the old style of stick tech that has a far higher chance of wearing out. When other manufacturers, Gamesir in particular, are putting out similarly priced hardware, with improved analogue sticks, it feels like Turtle Beach are a step behind with the Rematch.</p>
<p>As the Rematch is targeted as an entry-level pro-styled device, it’s little surprise to find the inclusion of two additional grip inputs, the flared, decently-sized buttons sitting easily beneath your middle fingers, and activating reassuringly with a press or even just a squeeze of the grip. They feel great in use, and are a real boon to players looking for an edge in competitive games.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the inputs don’t feel as good. The main face buttons are overly firm, and feel a fraction too high, making them feel slower in use. The digital triggers maintain some of that firmness, but they also make a slightly loose clacking sound that lends a sense of cheapness each time you use them. The shoulder buttons, at least, are fine, and benefit from activation across their entire length, but no interaction with the Rematch makes it feel as if this is a £50 controller.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of alternatives out there. If you own a Switch 2, the official <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch Pro Controller 2</a> is an easy choice, and while it’s more expensive, the overall build, the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone socket, and the console-level customisation for the grip inputs, are streets ahead of what the Rematch offers. As mentioned before, Gamesir is the current champion of this category, and both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> are fantastic. They’re fully featured pro controllers, with Hall Effect Sticks, better-feeling inputs, and a charging stand, and they come in at more or less the same price as the Rematch. The only downside is the need for an additional dongle that the Rematch doesn’t need.</p>
