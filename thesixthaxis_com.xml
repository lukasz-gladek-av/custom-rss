		<p>Zynga has announced that it will be shutting down Star Wars Hunters on October 1st, with the final season dropping on April 15th. The shutdown will come near enough four years after Star Wars Hunters first soft launched, which occurred in November 2021 in some countries. The game then released worldwide in early 2022. The full statement regarding the shutdown can be read below.</p>
