		<p>Change is coming with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> looked to redefine the open world experience and catching mechanics of the series, Z-A is bringing a huge overhaul of the combat. Gone is the turn-based battling, in favour of running around battle arenas in real time.</p>
<p><iframe title="[UK] Mega Victreebel: The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLrHQZF7IKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We sampled two sections of Pokémon Legends: Z-A at Gamescom, starting with a preview of the Battle Zone gameplay. During the day, Lumiose City is a shining beacon of peace and harmony, the metropolitan area being completely overhauled to feature Wild Zones for Pokémon, so that they can better coexist with humans –&nbsp;just don’t think about it too much, and you’ll be fine. But at night, Pokémon trainers emerge to engage in the Z-A Royale at designated Battle Zones, like they’re underground street racers, or something.</p>


<p>We’re introduced to this by Urbain, Naveen and Lida from Team MZ, a group that has taken it upon themselves to protect the city, and is there to guide you through these first nighttime battles.</p>
<p>It boils down to being an area and time dedicated to trainer battles. Other trainers will be hanging around in the Battle Zone waiting to challenge you as you come into view, though if you’re able to sneak up behind them, you’ll be able to launch an early surprise attack and gain an advantage.</p>


<p>So far, so Pokémon, but the battles themselves have a completely different feel thanks to the shift to real-time combat. You only fight with one Pokémon at a time, calling them out and then targeting and launching attacks and abilities as and when you please. These are then on a cooldown, but you can launch their other abilities while waiting for another one to recharge. As you give out your commands, they’ll leap into action, getting close enough to launch their attacks before returning to your side.</p>
<p>Being in real time and with free movement means that you’re also able to actively try to evade the attacks and abilities of your opponent’s Pokémon. This took me a little getting used to –&nbsp;think I was pressing to run instead of to dodge roll by mistake – but I managed to dodge some slower moving web attacks, and the like.</p>

<p>It’s a really big shift for the franchise, that’s for sure, and has allowed for some major new game modes to be added alongside the regular battles. Just last week <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/18/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-chaotic-4-player-battles-in-the-z-a-battle-club/">the four-player time-based Z-A Battle Club</a> was announced, for example, while we also got to try a battle against a Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon.</p>
<p>As part of a story moment where Team MZ is following a Zygard who really wants to lead you to something, we’re bundled into a battle with an Absol who’s being wracked by an unwanted Rogue Mega Evolution –&nbsp;they definitely saw this disaster coming! Thankfully the towering figure of ZA returning just in time to lend you his Lucario and a Mega Ring to aid in this fight.</p>
<p>Much like the regular real-time battles, you have free movement and can launch attacks as soon as they’re ready, with Lucario launching themselves into the fray. As you deal damage to Rogue Mega Evolved creature, they drop Mega Orbs that you’ll need to collect in order to charge up your Mega Ring and give Lucario their own Mega Evolution, letting them deal much more damage with their attacks.</p>

<p>There’s a nice back and forth here, as you can continue to run around and grab Mega Orbs, extending the time that Lucario can spend in their Mega form. You just need to be a little careful because, while you don’t have a health bar of your own, you can take damage and be KO’d yourself –&nbsp;this has the edges of the screen darken as a warning, but thankfully you will heal up again in a short span of time. Another thing to know is that using items is also on a cooldown, though opening the inventory screen does seem to pause the game in single player.</p>
<p>Playing these two battle experiences has me really looking forward to Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Jumping from turn-based to real-time battles is a big risk and will absolutely change the feel of the game compared to the classic, but once again, we’re getting closer to the style of battle that we see in the anime, running around, dodging attacks and giving your Pokémon commands. It’s a great shift that could easily define the next decade of Pokémon games.</p>

		<p>Of all the games annoucedby Nintendo for the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders is perhaps the most surprising. A sequel to the GameCube’s Kirby Air Ride, the connective thread passes between a whole bunch of Smash Bros. titles, as Masahiro Sakurai takes the opportunity to revisit one of his decades old game ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is racing within Kirby Air Riders, though it’s quite a distance from the tone and pace of Mario Kart. Riding on a machine through a gameplay tutorial, we’re introduced to boost charging while drifting, angling your vehicle to fly or glide after jumping from a ramp, the importance of needing to stick the landing by having your craft parallel when landing. And then there’s the classic ability to gobble up and shoot them out as stars, pull off a spin attack, or a more audacious character-specific super.</p>


<p>The quirk that I constantly tussled with is that you don’t need to press a button or push forward to move, and the demo was constantly telling me off for doing so. This does put the focus more on braking, drifting, flying and attacking, but it’s still something that I didn’t get used to while playing.</p>
<p>Your Special depends on the character you’re riding as, and there’s obviously a bunch of familiar characters from the Kirby series, including Meta Knight, King Dedede, Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, Starman and more. All of them are given the ability to inhale enemies in this game, absorbing their abilities or shooting out a star, but they have a unique Special, so Meta Knight’s sees him able to really take off and fly, while Chef Kawasaki chucks blobs of damaging gloop. Kirby actually has four different Specials: one for each of the four colour variants you can race as.</p>


<p>There’s more that Kirby Air Ride has to offer than track races in its Air Ride mode, and we went hands on with the returning City Trial mode, shifting across to something much more like a vehicular combat game for up to 16 players online.</p>
<p>City Trial takes place across multiple stages, first taking players to the floating island of Skyah to drive around freely, seeking out power-ups, attacking opponents to damage their machines, and more. You initially start off with a basic machine –&nbsp;the star-shaped jet, a uni-bike, car, and more – and want to race around, passing through power-up icons that can boost the various attributes.</p>

<p>It’s all rather chaotic, as you’d expect, with time ticking down and a need to gather as much as possible, while also denting the progress of your rivals. Each machine can only take so much damage, and while you can restore it, there’s the risk that you’ll lose a bunch of progress if it’s destroyed, and then have to run around on foot searching for a replacement!</p>
<p>It can also make the randomised Field Events a bit of a risk. Do you head in to help destroy the strange stone tower that’s appeared somewhere and risk taking damage from other players? Or do you stay away and do your own thing?</p>

<p>As the timer on this first sessions comes to an end, you get to see how you’ve done in collecting different stat boosts, and then get to choose which finale Stadium stage you want to take part in. These are different mini-game modes, from simple races, to a Dustup Derby, and you want to choose one that will best suit your vehicle’s stats – handily the game suggests what would be a good match. Curiously, this doesn’t keep the full lobby together, breaking you into smaller groups by preference, making that choice more specifically strategic and meaning that you could end up taking on this second part of the game mode on your own.</p>
<p>Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.</p>
