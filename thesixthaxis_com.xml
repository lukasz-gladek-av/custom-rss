		<p>Creepy Jar has released a brand new trailer for its base building survival game StarRupture, giving a positive look at what is a not so great situation. The representative of Claywood Corporation gives a cheery view to the prisoners and exiles of Arcadia 7 on the luxuries they can expect, including accommodation, access to new technology, and nice views. The only disadvantage is the work and the hostile animal life that wants to feed on your base’s resources.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - &quot;Special Message&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0GBfgSq_5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Creepy Jar released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/starrupture-gets-10-minutes-of-showcase-footage-showing-gameplay/">10 minutes of showcase footage showing gameplay for StarRupture</a>, which focused on the world of Arcadia 7 and its dangers. Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">in our review</a> Steve said,&nbsp;<em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

<p>StarRupture will launch into Steam Early Access on January 6th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Visual Design]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/game-of-the-year-2025-best-visual-design/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our Game of the Year picks for 2025 as we look to hand out our gong for Best Visual Design. Every year, this ends up being a heavily contested category, always swinging between games that impress in terms of sheer fidelity, pushing gaming hardware to the very limit, and titles with peerless art direction that seek to do more with less. More often than not, the winner strikes a deft balance between the two, as proved by this year’s winner…</p>

<p>We’ve always had somewhat of a soft spot for all things <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/03/01/review-journey-ps3/">Journey</a>. We’re also big fans of anything developer Giant Squid puts their name to, the studio’s previous games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/09/abzu-review/">Abzû</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/the-pathless-review-ps4-ps5-xbox-mobile/">The Pathless</a> – have a distinct Journey-like quality to them. So, naturally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/sword-of-the-sea-review/">Sword of the Sea</a> almost feels tailor-made for us here at TSA, coming full circle with Journey’s art director, Matt Nava, joining forces with Giant Squid for a visually stunning jaunt through carefully crafted vistas.</p>


<p>These games shred dialogue and exposition, presenting their stories through striking set pieces and multi-layered worlds that flit between calmly isolating and full of life. As you play Sword of the Sea, you’ll venture through familiar deserts as well as ruins, and snowy mountains, the hero’s trusty blade capable of transforming these areas into thriving aquariums teeming with enchanting sea life. It’s yet another gorgeous game from Giant Squid and a worthy winner of this year’s award for Best Visual Design.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>When it comes to the rhythm action genre visuals can be just as important as audio, as proven by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a>. It may not be quite as entrancing and new-feeling as developer Enhance’s previous game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/16/tetris-effect-connected-review-xbox-series-x/">Tetris Effect</a>, but it comes pretty close, pairing catchy tracks with immersive stage backgrounds and visual effects timed perfectly to match the player’s button presses. Together, these elements offer that near hypnotic sensory experience that elevates the Lumines formula and adds prestige to what started off as a gem for the PlayStation Portable.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>Grabbing its second podium finish in this year’s Game of the Year awards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> really is the full package. Aside from its gripping, emotional narrative and smart evolution of the turn-based RPG formula, it also boasts some of this year’s most jaw-dropping visual set pieces.</p>
<p>Making smart use of ready-made assets for environments and scenery, to let the team put their efforts toward the more impactful “hero assets”, Sandfall conjured up a&nbsp;distinct dream-like surrealness that gives Expedition 33 its own identity, galvanised by Art Nouveau and Belle Époque influences. It breaks free of fantasy and steampunk tropes, imbuing every aspect – from character designs to battle menus – with a masterfully curated touch.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/17/keeper-review/">Keeper</a></li>
<li>Once Upon A Katamari</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you come back tomorrow, for another aspect and accomplishment of game making to be featured.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Speedrunners creators are back with new game Sprint City]]></title>

		<p>The original creators behind Speedrunners, Casper &amp; Gert-Jan, have announced Sprint City which is being developed by Second Stage Games. Sprint City looks very much like a successor to Speedrunners, though there is also a Speedrunners 2 in development by Fair Play Labs. It seems 2026 will be the year of sprinting for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sprint City | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2M4SkQLFRGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Co-Owner &amp; Game Designer at Second Stage Studio, Casper van Est, said <em>“With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we’re best at, which is pure movement. It’s a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that.”</em></p>
<p>In Sprint City, up to eight players can race against each other or free roam across different courses in the city, using wall runs and grapples to keep momentum going. Additionally, anyone who owns Sprint City will be able to invite friends in to play the game, even if they themselves do not own it. In multiplayer there will be leaderboards to climb as you aim to become the best sprinter in Sprint City.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Sprint City, but it is due to enter Steam Early Access in 2026.</p>
