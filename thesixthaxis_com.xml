		<p>CyberConnect2 is celebrating its 30th anniversary in style by announcing the reveal of .hack//Z.E.R.O., the first original .hack console game in over a decade. There is not too much detail about what to expect with .hack//Z.E.R.O., but CyberConnect 2 is taking full control of the development of the game including publishing. Bandai Namco has been the main publisher of the series previously.</p>

<p>On the official website CyberConnect2 wrote, <em>“The&nbsp;.hack&nbsp;series has always been developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, but for&nbsp;.hack//Z.E.R.O., Bandai Namco Entertainment has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2. World-renowned violinist Taro Hakase has penned the music, kick-starting the project to the dexterous tune of his violin.&nbsp;.hack//Z.E.R.O.&nbsp;will be a novel RPG experience that blends the series’ trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations, infused with 100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit. The game will&nbsp;be enjoyable for both veteran fans and new players alike. Please look forward to this newest iteration of&nbsp;.hack.”</em></p>
<p>Platforms and release dates are yet to be confirmed as .hack//Z.E.R.O. has only just entered development, so it may be a couple of years away from release.</p>
