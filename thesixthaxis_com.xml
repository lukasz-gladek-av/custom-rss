		<p>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for upcoming Elden Ring spin off Elden Ring Nightreign, with this footage focusing on the Raider character that players will be able to choose. The Raider is described as a powerful sea farer who is very partial to enormous weapons. The short trailer gives a look at the Raider’s abilities and how the class will complement the full group of players.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Raider Character Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjAdGN4-lvU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Raider has a passive ability called Fighters Resolve, which means he cannot be knocked down when using the retaliate skill. That leads nicely on to the Raider’s character skill which is Retaliate. That is a punch that has the chance to stagger enemies, regardless of size. Then Raider’s ultimate art is Totem Stella which brings a giant tombstone out of the ground dealing damage to enemies while boosting the power of allies. The tombstone can also be used as a platform to jump on.</p>
<p>There are four different versions of Elden Ring Nightreign that are available for pre-order, with those being the Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Seekers Edition, and the Collector’s Edition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Edition – The full Elden Ring Nightreign game at £34.99.</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition – This version of the game includes access to the post release DLC, digital artbook, and mini soundtrack. Those who pre-order will also get a bonus gesture. This version is priced at £47.99.</li>
<li>Seekers Edition – This version includes a steelbook with the full game, post release DLC, digital artbook, and digital soundtrack. Again, those who pre-order will get a bonus gesture too. It is also worth noting that the Seekers Edition is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</li>
<li>Collector’s Edition – Included with this is the full game, steelbook, digital soundtrack, a 25cm statue of Wylder, eight Nightfarers cards, and a 40 page hardback artbook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will release on May 30th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>
