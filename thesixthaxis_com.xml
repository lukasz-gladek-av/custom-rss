		<p>It feels like I’ve spent most of this week playing the game ‘avoiding the Christmas crowds’, but I did get to enjoy my own version of Thanksgiving where I just watched NFL for six hours, and didn’t have to think about turkey for another month. In terms of gaming, I’ve been playing a truckload of Octopath Traveler 0, as well as some more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Tomb Raider Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Besides that, I’ve been checking out Assetto Corsa Rally, and messing with GeForce Now across a bunch of platforms to see how it performs.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/sweet-surrender-review/">Sweet Surrender</a> for review, as well as Halls of Torment and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Bizarrely keen to try and take on the Marvel Rivals PlayStation Cup challenge next week, <strong>Ade</strong> has been practicing by polished off his review of the retro-styled scrolling beat ’em up Marvel Cosmic Invasion. The embargo for that is on Monday, so check out his review then!</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has had a much quieter week. After flitting between a glut of new multiplayer games, he’s back to Ghost of Yotei as he focuses on finishing the main quest.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Duskpunk for review, which is a mix of Citizen Sleeper meets the rough life in a town full of opportunities and misfortune. Sounds great to me!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing the natural pairing of Terrifier: the Artcade game and Spongebob Square pants: Titans of the Tide. This weird gaming concoction has had mixed results, with Steve telling us, “The first was unfortunately pretty rubbish but the second is a solid, albeit short, 3D platformer” He continued, “With those wrapped, I’ve moved onto an indie space horror that’s been years in the making and is wonderfully atmospheric.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been curling himself up into a ball for an upcoming review, while also dabbling with some upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide DLC, and dipping into some cheap Black Friday sale pick ups, like Loop Hero.</p>
<p>And what about you? Have you played anything this week? Why not tell us about it!</p>
