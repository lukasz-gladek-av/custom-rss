		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> Patch 8.0 arriving last week, adding <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/space-marine-2-endless-siege-mode-is-coming-in-junes-free-update/">the big new Siege Mode to the game</a>, Saber Interactive has now teased a little of what they have planned for the game’s anniversary. Update 10.0 will arrive in September, and it’s planned as “a large-scale update”, heralding the start of a second year of both free and paid DLC content.</p>
<p>But first some bad news. With the scope of what the 10.0 update will bring, Saber has decided that Update 9.0 will only bring balancing changes and no new content, so the new PvP mode that was planned for 9.0 has been postponed and rolled into 10.0 as well.</p>


<p>This new game mode (while they won’t go into specifics) will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new mode-specific map</li>
<li>Chaos vs. Chaos PvP</li>
<li>Playable controlled Helbrutes</li>
</ul>
<p>With how Chaos-centric this new mode is, new Chaos armours will be added to the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new melee weapon: the Power Axe. This will have new moves, execution animations and more.</p>


<p>And finally, a new class is being introduced for both PvE and PvP in the form of the Techmarine. More details on this class will come in the next community update post.</p>
<p>With the arrival of update 10.0, Space Marine 2 will be heading into its second year, and given the huge success of the game, Saber is committing to a second year of both free and DLC content – this means there will be a new yearly season pass for those who need more Space Marine customisation options. The core of the content will be freely available to all, though, and so we can expect to see more new&nbsp;PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and even more beyond that.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>
