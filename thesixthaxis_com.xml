		<p>Ahead of its release in February, Nacon and Cyanide Studio have dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">a demo for Styx: Blades of Greed onto Steam</a>, letting players check out the first hour of the game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> is launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 19th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwliU5XsytQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a time-limited demo, which will be pulled from availability at some point, but if you do slink in to check it out on PC and buy the game on that platform, then your save will carry across to the full game.</p>
<p>The demo kicks off from the very start of the game, where you’ll get to experience Styx infiltrating a golem and destroying it from the inside out, and then take on his first real mission to steal a zeppelin right out from under the Inquisition and break through their blockade of The Wall.</p>
<p>This is just a taster of what the full game has to offer, with Styx and his crew visiting three open environments to sneak through, and picking up new tricks, powers and tools to let him explore further and further. There’s things like a grappling hook and glider, there’s new Quartz powers for mind control and time shifting, and a story that weaves together the human Inquisitors, Orcs and Elves in variously nefarious ways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">I previewed Styx: Blades of Greed back at Gamescom</a>, and it was this opening section of the game that I had the chance to play back then. After a lenghty hiatus between games, I said,&nbsp;“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>

		<p>Daedalic Entertainment and developer gameXcite have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> will let you re-experience and retell the tale of Star Trek: Voyager on 18th February 2026. Additionally, the game will launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> alongside PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Now, try as I might, I couldn’t get a sensible Stardate calculation for that headline – Stardates all started in reference to the 24th century, so trying to figure one out for the 21st century just gives some ludicrous negative number like -296868.49 – but 18th February will line up with Stardate 48315.6, when Voyager is whipped across the Galaxy by the Caretaker.</p>


<p>That’s your starting point in the game, after which you need to navigate the perilous path back to the Alpha Quadrant, encountering the Kazon, the Borg and much more.</p>
<p>You can check this out for yourself with the free demo now available across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. This is an updated demo compared to last year, which will also come to Switch 2 and PC soon. This updated demo brings an improved UI, better ship controls, refined combat and notifications for when you reach key decision moments.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointing is the reveal of a Deluxe Edition of the game. This features more missions, more heroes and more technologies that you can tap into from aliens across the Delta content. I don’t know how I feel about gatekeeping that kind of content in this instance.</p>
