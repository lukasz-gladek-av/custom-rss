		<p>This week the Tomb Raider franchise turned 28 years old, first introducing Lara Croft to the world in 1996. Earlier this month, we saw the release of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix, an animated show set after the events of 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Now. Crystal Dynamics has confirmed that the show has been confirmed for a second season.</p>

<p>A short blurb for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft season two has been released by Crystal Dynamics, giving us a short glimpse of what to expect. “<i>When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.”</i></p>
<p>The announcement of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft follows the reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/11/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-announced-for-another-valentines-day-release/">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a>, which is going to be released on February 14th, 2025. This collection will include The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. Aspyr Media is developing this collection and, just like the first collection, players will the choice of both overhauled and classic graphics that can be switched between. There is a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, but the option to play with classic tank controls will also be included.</p>

<p>In our Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review, Jim wrote, <em>“Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</em></p>
