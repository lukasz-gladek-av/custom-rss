		<p>Microsoft’s cross-platform push is bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-releases-this-fall/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/age-of-mythology-retold-has-been-revealed/">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold will launch for PS5 on 4th March with Age of Empires II: DE coming to Sony’s console later this spring.</p>


<p>Launching at the exact same time as the PS5 port is the Immortal Pillars expansion for Age of Mythology: Retold. This delves into Chinese culture and mythology for its inspiration, featuring 12 new gods, such as Fuxi, Shennong, Nüwa, Gonggong and Zhurong, a 9-level campaign, new mythical units and 7 new maps.</p>
<p>Immortal Pillars is bundled into Age of Mythology: Retold Premium Edition, which also grants 5 days early access to the game on PS5 from 27th February.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty special time to be a fan of Age of Empires series, with Microsoft having greenlit remasters/remakes of the whole classic RTS series, as well as bringing out Age of Empires 4 as a brand new entry. But they haven’t stopped there. Instead of treating each game’s remaster as a final, definitive edition, they have (regardless of the name) also brought new expansions, new campaigns and factions to the table. There’s also multiple expansions coming to Age of Empires 4 later this year.</p>

<p>A lot of this has been done with Microsoft’s World’s Edge team working closely with the fan-founded team at Forgotten Empires. Immortal Pillars also has Virtuos Games and Tantalus Media as developers.</p>
<p>It’s not always gone perfectly to plan, though. With so many Age of Empires games now being viewed as current projects, all deserving of attention and expansions, the teams have been stretched a bit too thin, and the audience spread across too many games. Because of this, it was recently <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-dlc-news/">announced that further Age of Empires 3 DLC has been cancelled</a>, and that it had been announced too soon before work had begun.</p>
