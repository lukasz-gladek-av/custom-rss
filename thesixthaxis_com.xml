		<p>It’s been slower going than I’d hoped with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> enhanced lineup of games, as I wrangle together all the video clips and comparison points I need. I’m close to completing our Insomniac games round-up though, and I’m convinced that they’re the single best development studio out there this generation. Who else has managed to deliver three games in four years, pushing the boundaries for console graphics and world building each time, and reliably returned to previous releases to keep on delivering new tech options? They’re at it again with PS5 Pro, and long may it continue!</p>

<p>We’ll start off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who turned in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">review of Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which wasn’t quite on the level of TT Games’ series, but certainly looks absolutely gorgeous. He’s joined that up with more Metaphor: Refantazio, and he’s been on a trip to play a mystery game. More on that soonish?</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing the curiously titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/">Max Mustard</a> on PSVR 2, which is surprisingly not a game about a hotdog stall that’s run out of ketchup. He’s also played Phasmophobia with his sister, and found that he really likes it now that he’s figured out more about how it works.</p>


<p>It’s been most Black Ops 6 for <strong>Jim</strong>, now that Season One is live, and he’s still having a great time with it. He’s also returned to New World: Aeternum and is approaching the endgame and PvP content that waits after level 60 &nbsp;– “It’s the most fun I’ve had playing a console MMO since Final Fantasy XIV and it’s good to see just how populated the world is, even if it means getting my ass handed to me in PvP zones.”</p>
<p>3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is, according to <strong>Aran</strong>, exactly what it sounds like. “It is a 3D revision of the original Don’t Die Mr Robot, and my full review should be out next week.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Steve</strong> has also played some 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot, as well as an early build of Soulframe (from the makers of Warframe), Steve reviewed “the effortlessly cool and sexy <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/sorry-were-closed-review/">Sorry, We’re Closed</a>, a game that takes the bones of a survival horror and reinvigorates them into something that feels fresh.”</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> apologised for playing Destiny 2, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> real world gaming adventure of Moving House went very well, but he now has the&nbsp;unpacking, painting, and sorting DLC to do. Maybe not quite in that order.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>
