		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>
