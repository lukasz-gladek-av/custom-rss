		<p>Now that Thanksgiving is out of the way in the US, and as we tick on over into December this weekend, it’s time for everyone to accept that it’s Christmas. Start your Advent calendars, decorate trees, make and/or eat mince pies, panic over any presents you have to buy and haven’t yet… you know. Christmas.</p>
<p>And that also means that almost all the big games of the year are now out – there’s pretty much just Indiana Jones, it feels like – and we’ve got all those Game of the Year awards to sort out. The Game Awards is just around the corner though, to add a little spice with expensive advert slots for trailers and announcements.</p>
<p>All of which means that this week has been a little slow.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been playing this past week.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> is still working through Dishonored’s DLC, messed around with Dreams some more, and managed to survive a full campaign of 60 Parsecs for the first time. He also plugged a 1TB SSD into his PS5, which was “almost as easy as that time I added a 16KB expansion to my ZX81.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>
