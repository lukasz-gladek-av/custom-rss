		<p>Krafton are teaming up with YouTube series Skibidi Toilet, pitting players against an invasion of sentient toilets. That’s a thing, it’s live now in PUBG Mobile and will launch on PC and consoles later in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG MOBILE X Skibidi Toilet | Collaboration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEWqww6iCK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you are unaware of Skibidi Toilet, it was a viral short-form series “that has expanded into a global franchise spanning animation, consumer products, publishing, gaming, and more.” It has not, however, reached the part of South London I am currently working from, so here’s more from the press release as I have no bloody idea about Skibidi Toilet, it looks very silly.</p>
<p>“Set in an alternate reality, the series follows humanity’s struggle against the Skibidi Toilets, a powerful alien species of mechanized toilet hybrids. Their only hope lies with the Alliance, a coalition of humanoid warriors with cameras, speakers, and TV screens for heads,” say Krafton.</p>
<p>“The new Arcade mode will be available for two weeks on PC and consoles, where players take on the role of the Alliance to defend the world against the powerful Skibidi Toilets and Astro Toilets in a PvE boss battle,” they add. “Through the Event Pass, players can also unlock Alliance-themed outfits inspired by the Skibidi Toilet universe.”</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that sentient shitters have a long history of antagonising gamers, the elderly amongst you may recall being chased by munching water closets in the seminal 1984 classic, Jet Set Willy. They have been more useful in recent years with the crappers in Suda 51’s No More Heroes doubling up as a save point whenever you decide to do a number two.</p>
<p>In 2022 an entire horror game was set in a public bathroom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrw10P2hA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Toilet Chronicles</a>. It has a “very Positive” rating on Steam although most comments are along the lines of “What the hell did I just play?”</p>
