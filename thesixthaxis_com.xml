		<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s launch server issues have been resolved, Asobo Studio has stated, with server capacity now increased to meet demand and reliability at over 99.999%. Patches are due next week on 2nd and 9th December aiming to make further client-side improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-27-update/">update to the community</a> follows on from launch woes that saw players shoved into unending queues and the servers unable to cope with demand. <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now/">Hotfix 1</a> was released last Friday on 22nd November to address key snags that people were facing, though there is one outstanding issue with outdated marketplace content from MSFS 2020 clashing with the new install of MSFS 2024 on PC.</p>


<p>As noted last week, “outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behavior.” The advice was basically to remove that content.</p>
<p>Along these lines, most MSFS 2020 content has now been ported across to MSFS 2024, though with community reports and analytics showing that some 3rd party add-ons are still problematic, Asobo is currently blocking all MSFS 2020 non-aircraft content from use with MSFS 2024.</p>
<p>The patch on 9th December will add a feature for users to disable and enable content themselves, and a safe boot option that can deactivate all 3rd party content at once if you’re struggling to launch the game.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16882910197148-Known-issues-for-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-2024">an FAQ for outstanding issues</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the circles you fly in, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has maybe flown under the radar – heh – compared to its predecessor. The 2020 game was a marvel of conception and execution, able to approximate the entire world for players to fly in, and then with Asobo releasing a long-running stream of content updates to add more human-created touches of reality. MSFS 2024 sounds like it would be more iterative – and purchased content does carry forward – but has made some major changes to allow you to land and hop out of your aircraft, to bring a more meaningful career mode to the game with new mission types, and more.</p>
