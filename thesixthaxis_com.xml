		<p>Videogamer, a once respected gaming site, is now seemingly only posting content created by AI.&nbsp; Investigations by various outlets, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-metacritic-ai-review-videogamer-2000674042">Kotaku</a>, have revealed that the new “staff” have AI photos, have brand new social media accounts, and, despite their bios suggesting they have been writing about video games and tech for years, no one has ever heard of them.</p>
<p>This came to the fore when a review for Resident Evil Requiem was posted, which was clearly written by AI, and this was included on Metacritic.</p>


<p>“Metacritic has been a reputable review source for a quarter century and has maintained a rigorous vetting process when adding new publications to our slate of critics,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told&nbsp;Kotaku. “However, in certain instances such as a publication being sold or a writing staff having turned over, problems can arise such as plagiarism, theft, or other forms of fraud including AI-generated reviews.”</p>
<p>“Metacritic’s policy is to never include an AI-generated critic review on Metacritic and if we discover that one has been posted, we’ll remove it immediately and sever ties with that publication indefinitely pending a thorough investigation.”</p>
<p>A number of other reviews from Videogamer, including a Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen , have also been removed.</p>

<p>Videogamer was sold to a company called BGFG, which pushes online casinos and gambling. Google the name Videogamer now and the site states it is a “source for video and casino game news.”</p>
