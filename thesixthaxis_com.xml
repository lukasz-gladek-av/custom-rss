		<p>Bandai Namco has announced Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2, with this upgraded version of the original game set to release on October 10th. However, you can play it from today but there is a catch in that you have to pre-order Little Nightmares 3 to get access to it.&nbsp; The game will feature 60fps and 4K resolution. This is not the first we have heard of this release as it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-has-been-rated-for-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs/">rated for PS5, PC &amp; Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;</a>in 2023.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition will have 4K visuals, run at 60 fps and have updated visuals. You can see how it compares to the original in the trailer above. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares Review,</a> Tuffcub said, <em>“Little Nightmares is something of a minor classic. Gorgeously gross and surprisingly inventive, it creates a genuine feeling of terror and tension. It’s a bit odd to say a game that involves skipping over corpses is enjoyable, but it is, just don’t blame Tarsier if you have nightmares.”</em></p>
<p>This was not the final announcement from The Little Nightmares Showcase, as it as also been confirmed there is Little Nightmares VR project in development too. It is called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes, though no more information has been announced for it.</p>
