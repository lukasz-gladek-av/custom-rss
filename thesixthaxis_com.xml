		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

		<p>Team Peak has revealed that next week on November 5th it will be updating Peak and adding a new biome for players. That biome has been called Roots and from the brief teaser it looks like there will be tree climbing involved, and possibly spiders grabbing players. You can check out the short look at the Roots biome in the teaser below.</p>
