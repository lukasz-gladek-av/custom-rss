		<p>Survival games are not a rare commodity, nor are games set on Mars, but what if you could explore the real surface of the Red Planet in a simulation game? That’s the premise for Horizon Journey, which launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769960/Horizon_Journey/">Steam Early Access</a> today, 30th January 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Journey - Anouncement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lb32WTnYZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game has been built using NASA-based environmental data and has you facing the extremes you would find on Mars, from drastic temperature variations to fierce dust storms. These are on top of all the usual survival game requirements such as food and health. </p>
<p>“During your journey you’ll discover and expand the N16 base using modular corridor systems, including Labs, Storage, and Crafting modules. Plus, you’ll have the chance to utilise rovers and drones to scan the terrain and navigate the mysteries hidden within the Martian landscape,” say Redivded Studios. </p>

<p>The Early Access version will give you a 4km² region of Mars to explore with a focused narrative that requires the player to investigating a sudden loss of communication with the Endeavor-16 expedition. The full game will launch later this year with a global terraforming system, expanded colony infrastructure, and a Sandbox Mode.</p>
