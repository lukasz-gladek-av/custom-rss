			<p>Stealth games, if you ask me, are a bit stupid. In fact, the term stupid doesn’t do justice to their inherent preposterousness and borderline obtuse behaviour, as your character crouches down like a bear in the woods, doing the side-crab shuffle for mile after virtual mile, because apparently – despite being some muscle clad badass weighed-down by weaponry – crouching makes you harder to see? Have you ever tried crouch-walking around in your day-to-day? If not, let me assure you, it does not make you harder to see. Everyone will spot you and they will mock you.</p>
<p>Then there’s the incoherent rules, with enemies spotting players lurking behind walls because<em>,</em> well, <em>reasons. </em>Maybe your vision didn’t have the right kind of vignette?&nbsp;And don’t get me started on goldfish brained henchmen on patrol who are not concerned that the three people they have been speaking to on a loop for the last twenty minutes have inexplicably disappeared. Thankfully, Shadow Tactics: Aiko’s Choice, is a stealth game that bucks the trend. Smart, challenging, and immaculately crafted, <em>this</em> is the kind of stealth based action I’ll crab-walk in the shadows for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice | OUT NOW on Consoles!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/al9rQDa_Ic0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Played from a top-down isometric perspective, Shadow Tactics: Aiko’s Choice gives you control of a merry-band of iconic feudal-Japan archetypes. There’s a Ninja who can throw shuriken and clamber across rooftops, a heavily armoured Samurai who can go toe-to-toe with any foe, a kunoichi&nbsp;who can don disguises and murder death kill with only a hairpin, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Your team are tasked with protecting the Shogun, which usually means carefully and strategically stealth killing your way across immense and intricate levels. You are, for the most part, left to carve you own path across the environment, completing a few objectives on the way.</p>


<p>Shadow Tactics: Aiko’s Choice is a standalone expansion to 2016’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/02/shadow-tactics-ps4-xbox-review/">Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</a>. Released way back in 2021 on PC, this substantial expansion has now made its way to console around <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/29/shadow-tactics-developer-mimimi-games-is-shutting-down-following-shadow-gambit-release/">a year after Mimimi Games closed down</a>.</p>
<p>Taking place towards the endgame of Blades of the Shogun, Aiko’s Choice unapologetically throws the player in at the deep end. Because of this, the storyline never lands – it’s hard to be invested when you honesty can’t remember any of the backstory that is being liberally referred to. Additionally, from the get-go, you have near every character, every ability, and every game mechanic at your disposal. It is overwhelming, and the developer makes little to accommodate to those, like me, who last played the original game some eight years ago.</p>
<p>As such, you really just have to figure things out as you go. Which, admittedly, isn’t for everyone. Indeed, considering the timescales between the original game’s release and this (again) standalone expansion, a new tutorial level, drip-feeding characters and concepts, would most certainly have been welcome. Yet, stick with it, persist, and you’ll be rewarded with one of the best stealth-strategy games out there.</p>

<p>It’s the clear rules of Shadow Tactics that sets it apart from many of its stealth contemporaries. Being able to see the view cone of any enemy with a click, or to know which foes on the entire map can see a certain location, is glorious. It’s a stealth game that doesn’t prat about, if an enemy can see your player character, then they see them, if they can’t, they can’t. Even better, your foes have just enough brains to make them interesting. Kill every soldier on a samurai’s path and they’ll soon get wise, going in search of the mysterious culprit.</p>
<p>Because of these coherent and well sigh-posted rules, you don’t get naffed off when you are spotted and everything goes to hell, you know that it’s because you went wrong and there will be an optimum way through that section, you just have to experiment to find it. That said, when you are spotted, it doesn’t mean it’s all over. Part of Shadow Tactics charm is when things get bombastic, you must think fast and improvise, hacking your way through foes and somehow emerging alive at the end.</p>

<p>The difficulty is steep in Aiko’s Choice, and progress is slow, but having an intelligent enemy who pushes back challenges you to best utilise your character’s abilities and tools. To have your varied heroes work together in perfect synchronicity. This is made easier thanks to the superb controls and display – if only every PC port could be this well thought through – and made enjoyable thanks to the sheer brilliance that is Shadows mode.</p>
<p>Shadows mode enables you to set a series of inputs and commands for every character. Then, with the tap of a button, you can see your finely honed plan carried out – there will be fist-pumps of delight when it works, sighs of despondency and a quick load when it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Seeing five different characters, all performing their contrasting actions together coherently, wiping out a host of enemies in one collective and fluid motion simply never gets old. As Hayoto leaps from a rooftop to pin down a foe lured by Yuki’s decoy, Aiko strikes under covering fire from the marksman Takuma, whilst Mugen fends off a pack of ambushers that you spotted lurking nearby. I’m not sure strategy video games get more satisfying than this.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/outriders">Outriders</a> developer People Can Fly has announced that they are laying off 120 employees, as they reduce a self-publishing strategy and suspend or scale down work on multiple projects.</p>
<p>Posting the public announcement on social media, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said:</p>


<p>“The videogame market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game.</p>
<p>“We believe in our teams, games, and their potential, and we remain extremely committed to continuing that journey, but we need to tailor our plans to our financial capacity. […]
</p><p>“We recognize this is a profoundly challenging time for our team members, as we say goodbye to valued colleagues who have contributed so much. We are focused on supporting those impacted during this transition providing them with resources and assistance to navigate this change, and are equally committed to caring for those staying, who are managing the challenges of losing coworkers and friends. Our priority is to approach this moment with compassion and to ensure our team feels supported as we work together to build a stronger future.”</p>
<p>People Can Fly had over 700 employees before the layoffs – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241128230626/https://peoplecanfly.com/#who-we-are">the most recent headcount update</a> on their site came at the end of last month – spread across multiple locations in Poland, the UK, Ireland, and North America. The company had grown massively over the past decade, numbering around 40 when they regained independence from Epic Games in 2015. It’s not clear where the layoffs will be coming from, with PCF Publishing HQ in Dublin, Ireland, a likely position, and whichever studios were heading up the affected projects.</p>

<p>It’s a trying time for the games industry as a whole, and a truly sucky time of year to be making layoffs, so we wish all those affected the very best.</p>
<p>The company had six codenamed projects in development and two of the self-published efforts are affected: Project Victoria, which is being completely suspended, and Project Bifrost, which is being scaled back. Other projects that have external backing are seemingly unaffected at this time, named Project Gemini with Square Enix, Project Maverick with Xbox and Project Echo with Krafton. Project Bison is still self-published, but as a VR title it could potentially have some external funding or exclusivity to assist it.</p>

		<p>Despite having previously said they were done with developing and improving <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red has just release Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which brings with it a fresh set of customisation options and an overhauled photo mode… and some bonus secrets.</p>
<p><iframe title="REDstreams — Cyberpunk 2077 | Update 2.2 Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIlOthAEggI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The photo mode overhaul is going to be the biggest new feature for keen video game shutterbugs. It now gives a fully independent Drone Camera that’s no longer set to orbit around V, and has an increased range. You can also toggle collision detection on and off, lock it, set a precision mode, spawn up to 3 NPCs to adjust and pose how you wish, spawn light sources, set effect intensity, and more.</p>
<p>That will go nicely with the expanded character customisation options with more eye colours, lip make up types, nail colours, scars, eyebrows, tattoos and on and on. The character creator randomiser now has a Plain-to-Punk slider as well, if you just want a vibe quickly.</p>
<p>More cars can use the Rayfield CrystalCoat tech, which lowers NCPD wanted level, and Twintone lets you scan a car you’re driving past and zap its colour scheme to your car in a flash.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there’s a smattering of other bug fixes and quality of life tweaks, and the curious note, “Added more secrets to discover in Night City.”</p>
<p>Intriguing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2 patch notes:</p>
<h4><strong>New Features</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield’s CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle’s color scheme for a small fee. You’ll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you’ll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
<li>The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>
<li>Archer Quartz EC-L r275</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 640 TS</li>

<li>Villefort Deleon V410-S Coupe (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
<li>Mizutani Hozuki MH2 (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what’s happening.</li>
<li>We’ve overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) – determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) – locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) – slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V’s apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/interface-sp/issue/2743/smartframe-and-the-gallery-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support article</a>.</li>

<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upgraded the Character Creator randomizer to feature a new Plain-to-Punk slider. Whether you’re aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance.</li>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn’t always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>
<li><em>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor</em> – Fixed an issue where no shard could be found on the cyberpsycho’s body, blocking progress.</li>
<li><em>Dream On</em> – The Trauma Team AV on the roof will now be properly hidden in stealth mode.</li>

</ul>
<h4><strong>Phantom Liberty-Specific</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Balls to the Wall</em> – Fixed an issue where it was impossible to exit the elevator and talk to Yuri because of an invisible wall.</li>
<li><em>Firestarter</em> – Fixed an issue where fast travel could be blocked if the player saved the game soon after exiting Reed’s car.</li>
<li><em>Gig: Waiting for Dodger</em> – After being freed, Bill and Charles will now be more mindful of their driving and avoid running over Dodger’s goons, preventing any unnecessary combat.</li>
<li><em>Hi Ho Silver Lining</em> – The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn’t meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li><em>I’ve Seen That Face Before</em> – The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li><em>Run This Town</em> – The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>
<li><em>Somewhat Damaged</em> – Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li><em>The Killing Moon</em> – Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the Synaptic Accelerator to stay active indefinitely if the player is detected while not in combat.</li>
<li>The car horn will no longer honk when the player reloads a weapon during vehicle combat while playing with a controller.</li>

<h4><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h4>

<li>Due to popular demand, we’ve lowered the <em>Trauma Drama</em> high scores.</li>
<li>Adjusted V’s mouth movement in various scenes, including the endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>PC-Specific</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/black-white-photography-sequel-toem-2-is-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Toem 2 was teased during the Wholesome Snack stream, revealing that a sequel to the black and white game of photography is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOEM 2 Teaser Trailer | Wholesome Snack 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze4DSeIhYAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s just a little bit of blurb about the game from developer Something We Made:</p>
<p>Step back into the shoes of a curious photographer and set off on a brand new adventure all about uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world’s little wonders in TOEM 2, the sequel to the acclaimed TOEM.</p>
<p>Yup, it’s a straight up sequel and looks to be following very much in the photographs of footprints of the original. You’ll play as a keen shutterbug who’s keen to explore the world around them through the lens of their camera, as you explore there’s plenty of people to help out with your photography skills, earning stamps needed to get the next free bus trip to another place.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, is in black and white, which gives the game its distinctive look.</p>
<p>For our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/toem-review-a-delightful-photo-adventure/">the original Toem</a>, Nic said, “Toem might be short, but with the number of challenges, and you can finish it an afternoon if you’re looking for something fun and relaxing to throw yourself at, or dip in and out to complete every little side mission. With the winter evenings drawing in, Toem is the kind of game I can see myself coming back to with a hot chocolate and a blanket, as I settle in to bring a little joy to the denizens of the world of Toem.”</p>
