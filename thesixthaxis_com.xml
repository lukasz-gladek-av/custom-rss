		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is no longer going to be released on September 5th, Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau have announced. Instead, the new release date will be October 31st due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that there has been a delay in manufacturing the physical copies of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and the second is that the extended window allows for additional development of the game.</p>

<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment wrote, <em>“Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025. Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us. This delay will also give the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself and we would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of Terminator 2D: NO FATE together. As such, this delay will apply to both physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>From the moment we announced Terminator 2D: NO FATE, the response has been absolutely amazing and truly humbling.So, to all of you, thank you so much for your support. We know that this news is disappointing and we appreciate your understanding. We are dedicated to delivering the best release possible for Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we look forward to sharing more of the game with you soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>
