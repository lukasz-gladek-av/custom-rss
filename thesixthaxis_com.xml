		<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine that’s sat in my backlog for years, and following the release and popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> last year, I thought it high time to delve into the first game and expand my very limited experience of the Warhammer universe. So, how does this 2011 third person hold up nowadays?</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40K Space Marine - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBB66g1PviE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a prime example of the third person shooters that released during the PS3/Xbox 360 era. It has some big set pieces, lots of areas with obvious cover interconnected by primarily brown environments, and a ton of bloody violence. The game borrowed from its contemporaries, in essence being a Warhammer version of Gears of War. As Captain Titus, you are sent to the Forge world Graia as part of the Vanguard to push back an Ork invasion, and protect its assets. Captain Titus is the embodiment of an Ultramarine, running towards danger with guns blazing and no fear of any potential harm. Okay, it is more of heavy thumping jog due to wearing towering combat armour. Very nice and blue armour.</p>
<p>Space Marine’s story is one of factions vying for control over a powerful resource, each with their own agendas. One side wants to hold power, while another wants to tear everything down and bring about a new order to the galaxy. It is a tale we have seen hundreds of times, and Space Marine follows the well-trodden tropes without deviating all that much. Maybe doing so would have been considered heresy? What does help is Captain Titus, whose character is stoic throughout the story but isn’t afraid to think for himself to get the job done, even if it means interpreting the rules slightly differently to others. One of his battle brothers, Sidonus, understands this while his other, Leandros, still needs to learn that lesson.</p>


<p>The gameplay of Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine does still hold up. The shooting feels decent, even if feedback could have been a bit more impactful, while the melee combat is very satisfying, whether you’re using the chainsword, axe, or the big thunder hammer. What makes all of these satisfying are the enemy hordes you battle. Space Marine sends waves of Orks at you through much of the game, making the action frenetic as you deal with the different enemy types. Swing a sword to cut through them and using a laser rifle to one-shot ranged enemies. The boss fights could have been a bit more entertaining, though. The way the final enemy is set up through the story of Space Marine makes it seem like a big one-on-one fight with him will be the main event of a box office pay per view. Instead, the end boss disappoints by being a QTE event after facing off against waves of his various minions, from weakest to strongest.</p>
<p>What was surprising about Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is that the online multiplayer still works, at least on PC. Though there was a little bit of a wait to fill a lobby, there are people still playing the online of Space Marine, even with the glitzier sequel. More people were in the PvP playlists, with that having the standard modes such as deathmatches and zone captures. The real fun, for me anyway, was the PvE mode where you and up to three others face off against enemy waves, moving through different maps to get to a final objective. This mode also throws quick challenges at you, like killing 20 enemies in 20 seconds or getting a number of headshots. If you want to experience what online multiplayer was like in 2011, then jump on Space Marine as soon as you can.</p>

		<p>With Bungie building up to the launch of their new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, the studio has been accused of plagiarising art for their game, with examples found within videos and screenshots of the game’s alpha build. Bungie has responded to these accusations and put the blame on a former artist, pledging to perform a review of in-game assets and to implement stricter checks on contributions going forward.</p>
<p>Digital artist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antire.al/post/3lpa4gamtzs2l">Antireal took to social media</a> to highlight that their work was being lifted by Bungie yesterday, higlighting some key examples where glyphs and sections of posters created in 2017 were being used as decals and textures in Marathon.</p>

<p>In response, Bungie used their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonteam.bungie.net/post/3lpb36jqb5c22">@MarathonDevTeam accounts</a> (their account with 10,300 followers on Twitter, instead of 117,700 for @MarathonTheGame or 2.8 million for @Bungie) to issue the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game</em>.</p>

<p><em>“This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</em></p>
<p><em>“To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>“We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</em></p>
<p>We hope that financial renumeration and credit is on the table as a part of “doing right by them”.</p>
<p>While plagiarism is a massive no-no, taking inspiration and copying idea is pretty much inevitable. It is fair to say, of course, that art is constantly evolving and drawing upon previous work for inspiration. You could just as easily draw a line back to the Wipeout franchise for the style of their glyphs and general designs, while <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-art-style-mirrors-edge-ghost-in-the-shell/">Marathon Art Director Joseph Cross has publicly noted Mirror’s Edge, Ghost in the Shell and others as inspirations</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is deeply disappointing as Bungie has been caught doing similar things in the past. In 2021 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pvu64p/bungie_accidentally_used_someones_fan_art_of_xivu/">Bungie used fan art in a Destiny 2 trailer</a>, and then for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/14evilb/bungie_stole_someones_art_for_the_new_cutscene/">another Destiny 2 cutscene in 2023</a>, and then ended up <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">compensating an artist after using their work for the physical Destiny 2 Nerf Blaster</a>.</p>
