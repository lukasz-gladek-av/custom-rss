		<p>The Nintendo Today app has revealed more of the small features that are featured in the Nintendo Switch 2, little technical quality of life tweaks that will hopefully make the system a better one for the long haul.</p>
<p>For those keen to keep their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> private, a PIN code lock will be available within the regular system settings, so you can set a code and keep pesky siblings, children, spouses and public transport thieves locked out from&nbsp;<em>your</em> games – obviously the last one would suck so much more if it happened to you than other people in your life just messing with your games.</p>


<p>The original Nintendo Switch also had a PIN code lock feature, though this was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Change-the-Parental-Controls-PIN-1494765.html">tied in with the parental controls</a>, and much less obvious for most users.</p>
<p>Another good feature for those who fuss and fret over battery capacity of their precious smart phones and laptops is the battery saver mode, which lets you tell the Nintendo Switch 2 to stop charging at 90%. This is good for those who tend to keep their consoles docked and rarely play handheld, where having a battery-powered device constantly connected and at 100% can negatively impact capacity – the data on this is a bit fuzzy for if it will help in day-to-day handheld use, though.</p>

<p>And finally, with the Joy-Con 2 able to switch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> at the twist of a wrist, the Switch 2 Home screen and all the system settings and menus can be navigated with a mouse pointer. A small thing, but kinda neat?</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a few weeks away from release on 5th June 2025, coming alongside Mario Kart World, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a pair of Zelda Switch 2 Edition titles</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/all-the-confirmed-nintendo-switch-2-launch-titles/">a plethora of old, new and enhanced third party games</a>, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization 7 and more. Of course, you also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">a huge back catalogue of compatible Nintendo Switch titles</a> that you can still dive back into.</p>
