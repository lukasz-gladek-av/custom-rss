		<p>One of the features that was not originally part of Football Manager 26, after having been part of the franchise for a while, were touchline or matchday shouts. These let managers express their emotions during games which, if they worked, could impact player morale. Now, Sports Interactive has added Shouts to Football Manager 26 in update 26.1.0, along with a number of other changes and fixes. You can see the whole list below.</p>

		<p>Digital Sun has shared a little look at what’s coming down the line for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/moonlighter-2">Moonlighter 2</a> roadmap as it goes through Early Access, the team keen to emphasise that this game is being built in collaboration and around the feedback of its players.</p>

<p>There’s two content updates planned between now and the 1.0 release, which will have a further batch of things to do and the ending to the story.</p>
<p>The first content update will include a fifth challenge, a new skill tree at Eris, a balance patch for perks and relics, and general balancing and quality of life improvements. The second content up date will add a sixth challenge, a fourth shop level with more space, showcases and decorations, new patches, and a pet seller with new bonus-granting bloblets.</p>

<p>Jason delved back into Moonlighter 2 for its early access, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">enjoyed the original game</a>. In his first impressions he said, “On the whole, I’m enjoying Moonlighter 2’s Early Access release. It’s a decent mechanical upgrade over the original game in the majority of areas, but it’s also fair to say that it’s losing a little something in the transition, and I find it a bit less whimsical. If you want more stuff to do and love a meta-grind though, then this game should satisfy that nicely.”</p>
