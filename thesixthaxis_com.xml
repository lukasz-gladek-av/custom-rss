			<p>Despite being a pretty big fan of the Disgaea franchise, I’ve never dabbled in the other strategy RPG releases that team has concocted over the years. Nippon Ichi Software has a massive catalogue of different titles to dig into, though, which also makes it so surprising that it took this long for the company to put out a sequel to something other than Disgaea. It’s been over twenty years since the original Phantom Brave came out, having been ported and remastered a few different times since that initial release. For a select group of dedicated fans, Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the chance to finally experience a new adventure in this world. As someone who never played the original, though, I was equal parts excited and cautious to see how much this game would differentiate itself from that far-too-familiar Disgaea formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero – Gameplay Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Knv_DXvub0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was also definitely concerned that hopping into the sequel to a game I never played would leave me with more questions than answers, but Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is incredibly easy to dig into as a newcomer. For one thing, the game’s intro does a good job of quickly introducing you to series protagonists Marona and Ash – a young girl who has the special ability to see and communicate with phantoms – and a phantom named Ash who has sworn to protect her at all costs. Very soon after introducing them to you, though, Marona and Ash are separated due to a mysterious attack, with Marona waking up on an unfamiliar island all alone. She soon meets a lonely Phantom girl named Apricot, whose father was the leader of a massive pirate crew before going missing. Tangled up with Apricot and searching for Ash, Marona ends up involved in a web of swashbuckling adventures as she sets out to help her new friend and find her old one.</p>


<p>I appreciated the way Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero balances the tone of it’s writing. I’ve come to expect zany, fourth-wall-breaking anime shenanigans from Nippon Ichi Software, but there’s a somewhat softer and more heartfelt vibe to this game. There are still silly jokes and weird characters, and literally every time Apricot is on screen I can’t help but laugh at how anxious and overwhelmed her portrait art looks. The themes of loss and death and family run deep in this game, though, and I appreciated that the macabre of it all isn’t entirely ignored – there’s a constant clash with the fact that you’re going on silly fun adventures with ghosts and then being reminded that these fun new friends are ghosts and have died, and the game takes the time to explore and unpack all of that in a way I really appreciated.</p>


<p>Phantoms aren’t just a thing for the sake of silly ghost jokes, though. Their existence (or lack thereof) is a major element of the combat in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero. Battles take place in small SRPG style maps, but with the familiar square-grid movement replaced with full dynamic movement around the map within a certain range. Protagonist Marona can’t do much by herself in any of these maps, though – but using her Phantom abilities, she can confine the ghostly friends in her party into any object on the map to give them a physical form. A Phantom who gets confined to an object will also get buffs or stat modifiers or new abilities depending on the object.</p>
<p>It’s a simple concept that quickly expands out in an overwhelming amount of ways. Some objects are linked thematically, and Phantoms confined to linked objects share those linked stats. Some characters can summon weapons and mechs called Gadgets that you can confine into to unlock extra attacks. Marona can even use Confriend to fuse with a Phantom on the field, changing her character model and giving her a few turns of ultra-powered action. The depth of the Phantom system is really impressive, and combined with the free movement it creates an entirely different battle flow and priority focus than in usual SRPGs. Positioning is key, but now so is environmental item awareness and managing your Phantoms time on the field efficiently.</p>

<p>It took a long time for the battles in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero to feel less overwhelming and more open-ended. In part, the way the game tutorializes and introduces you to the various mechanics at your disposal leaves a lot to be desired – the official English website for the game has a better on-boarding tutorial for the combat system than the game itself. Once things settled in and started to click though, it was so satisfying to almost stumble accidentally into really effective and surprising strategies. In one instance, I had a barehanded Phantom near a strong enemy, and thought to throw a powerful weapon from one of my allies to that unequipped Phantom – and it worked, letting me equip that thrown weapon onto them and deal with that enemy instantly.</p>
<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero does an excellent job of differentiating itself from the vibe and mechanics that the Disgaea franchise has made so familiar. It asks a lot of you in the beginning, but once you wrap your mind around it all, this ends up being one of the most inventive and original strategy RPGs I’ve ever played.</p>

			<p>I was ten years old when Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles first released. In the days of demo disks and consoles set up in shops, I was able to try the demo at the time and it was the closest a game had gotten to letting you feel like not only a Jedi, but a Jedi of your choice. Nowadays, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi</a> series pretty much nailing the “be a Jedi” thing, you might think that a remaster of the side-scrolling Jedi Power Battles is fodder for nostalgia and nothing more. And you’d be right.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles  - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YboMt_0kAJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Graphically, Jedi Power Battles is a huge improvement with this remastered release. It’s sharp, textures are much higher quality, there’s even reflections in places! If all you’re after is to replay the game, but with it looking like how you remember it in your rose-tinted memories, then this is the game for you.</p>


<p>In fact, it goes further than graphical improvements, with all the playable characters and levels all unlocked from the very beginning. Did you always want to inexplicably be Darth Maul fighting off Federation droids? Well you can do that immediately upon loading the game here, rather than having to first complete the game as Qui Gon Jinn to unlock Maul. And there’s the Star Wars music in the background as well, along with some creative uses of Yoda noises when picking up power ups that still make me laugh. It’s clearly designed to invoke that nostalgia, provided you have some for this game.</p>


<p>But if you don’t have that nostalgia? Well, the issue here is that this was an original PlayStation game. Combat is stiff and doesn’t flow very well at all – I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve run up to an enemy and pressed attack only for it not attack and for the droid I was attacking to punch me in the face instead. Because moves don’t really flow together very well, attacking feels like just swinging a lightsaber repeatedly with a brief delay between them that allows the enemy you’re trying to kill to get a hit in because lightsabers only take about a quarter of their health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can deflect a blaster bolt back at an enemy with a well timed press of the block button – easily the most satisfying aspect of gameplay – and it’ll one-shot them, so blasters deal more damage than lightsabers do, it turns out.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling platforming fares a little better, you can at least judge your jumps well enough to pull them off with relative ease.</p>

<p>What could have made all this stiffness irrelevant is the Force. If you had great Force powers that are fun and make you feel powerful, you might settle for stiff combat. Each character you can play as (excluding those without lightsabers, such as Queen Amidala) has three force powers. One is long range, another short, and another is defensive. Unfortunately they’re incredibly inconsistent as well as inaccurate to the lore.</p>
<p>I started with Darth Maul, because he’s awesome despite the awful film he was in, and his long range power is to shoot a laser from his eyes for some reason. Even so, you’ll be lucky if it actually hits a single one of the crowd of enemies in front of you. Qui Gon Jinn has got a particular set of skills that should make him a nightmare for droids like these, except here his long range and defensive skills don’t seem to work at all for some reason. They just don’t trigger – I get lightsaber attacks or jumps instead and my force power doesn’t drop.</p>
<p>The end result is just inconsistent in the same way that many of Aspyr’s Star Wars remasters have been. It looks nice enough for a remastered PlayStation game, but I just can’t imagine anyone wanting to play it for longer than thirty minutes outside of an attempt to recapture the feeling they had when they were younger and playing it for the first time.</p>
