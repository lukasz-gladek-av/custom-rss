		<p>Netflix has announced that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 is in development, though a release date is yet to be confirmed. If you have not watched the first season then stop now as the teaser trailer and the description has major spoilers about the events and outcomes of the original Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjhRSNkquOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 says, <em>“Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter? Director Kai Ikarashi (Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, SSSS.Gridman) brings a bold, cinematic vision to the series, supported by the lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners). They’re joined by returning collaborators Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare) and Hugo Award winner Bartosz Sztybor as Showrunner, Story Writer, and Producer.”</em></p>
<p>It has been nearly three years since the first Cyberpunk: Edgerunners series was released on Netflix, and told the story of David Martinez, a kid who lived in Night City and fell into a spiral while dealing with tragedy and the pressures of that the city threw at him. If you have not watched it, it is a decent watch and fleshes out the Cyberpunk 2077 world.</p>

		<p>Dredge developer Black Salt Games has announced that it has begun working on its next game, with development and support for Dredge officially over. Black Salt Games has stated that the next game is not Dredge 2, but a game set in a new world. No further details have been released about the game, and the studio will announce further details later.</p>
<p>Speaking of studios, Black Salt Games has also revealed it has opened a second studio called Disc 2 Games, with this studio focusing on 90’s inspired games which will be bright and colourful. Again, there are no details yet on the type of game Disc 2 Games is working on. This studio’s style seems to be the opposite to what Black Salt will be producing. In the announcement, Black Salt Games also expressed gratitude to fans saying, <em>“The team wants to send our heartfelt thanks to all our fans for their support for our debut title DREDGE – and would love for you to follow along on our next games. The future horizon for Black Salt Games and our second studio Disc 2 Games is shaping up to be an exciting ride!”</em></p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Dredge review, Tuffcub said, <em>“Dredge successfully balances a rather serene fishing game with something rather more dark and sinister lurking beneath the surface. Despite the spooky eyes, tentacles, and things going splash in the night, it’s really quite relaxing.”</em></p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li>TSBonyman’s about 70 hours into Tainted Grail, which is a huge amount of time, but he’s suffering a crash maybe once per 4-5 hour play session, which he’s putting up with and thankfully isn’t affecting his enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>
