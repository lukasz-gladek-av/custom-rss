			<p>Alta is a fighter. She’s trained her whole life to be the very best, forging a bloody path through a sea of enemies. As soon as she becomes the best… well, someone else soon comes along, and it turns out that now they’re the best. Video games don’t tend to spend much time on the psychological state of a warrior who’s lost everything, but Wanderstop deals in the spiral of self-loathing and failure that Alta suffers, showcasing her battle with the mental and physical pain she’s put herself through, and continues to do so.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor, but I know Alta is suffering from burnout. Her continual struggle and failures have left her exhausted, and she’s fundamentally breaking down. At the opening of Wanderstop, she’s racing through the forest, searching for Master Winters, a legendary warrior turned trainer who Alta believes can make her the greatest warrior. But first, she needs to rest. She can’t keep running at this pace, leaving her sword behind in an effort to keep going, and eventually collapsing.</p>
<p><iframe title="WANDERSTOP | PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsyvk0ArBb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You wake on a bench, sat next to the cheerfully huge figure of Boro. Boro owns the Wanderstop, a café in the middle of the forest, and while he’s concerned for Alta’s wellbeing, he also seems to want a spot of free labour, asking her if she’ll help out around the place while she recovers. There’s little else to do – it would be an incredibly short game otherwise – so Alta sets about brewing tea, growing exotic plantlife, and rebuilding her self-esteem by focusing on her well-being. For anyone caught up in the daily grind, Wanderstop delivers a message that you’d do well to listen to.</p>
<p>The world of Wanderstop is very beautiful. Painted in gorgeous pink, purple and blue hues, it’s clearly been designed to produce calming and stress-free sensations from players, and It works. Accompanied by the beautiful piano-led soundtrack, which moves between plaintive and playful, Wanderstop is a gorgeous journey for the senses.</p>


<p>Alta has, like most of us, got herself into a series of unhealthy thought processes, not least that pain, brutality and an unceasing desire to be the best, will result in you becoming the best. Wanderstop deals with exhaustion, with alternatives, and ultimately, with being kinder to yourself. Boro is the voice of your friends, your family, and possibly your therapist, telling you to slow down, and it’s a message we all need to hear. Of course, Alta doesn’t want to hear it at first, so instead, you make tea.</p>
<p>The Wanderstop’s tea-making machine, is an immense contraption of cunning and complicated design. There’s no PG Tips or Yorkshire Tea-style tea bags, nor an electric heating element, so instead you have to do everything by hand. This means clambering up ladders, bashing levers, pumping bellows, and adding the right ingredients to create the perfect cup of tea.</p>

<p>Tea is an event, and so is the rest and relaxation that it can bring, so the unnecessarily complicated method of brewing up, plays into the idea that you should enjoy the little things, and that you can make a ritual out of anything. Your customers are an interesting bunch, and their specific needs will dictate what tea you make them, diving into your field guide for ingredients and their helpful qualities.</p>
<p>Wanderstop tells you that there are no specific rules to the way that you play the game. Other than serving tea to customers, which forms the central gameplay mechanic, you can potter about as much as you like, sweeping up leaves, growing magical plants or just drinking tea. Everyone loves drinking tea.</p>
<p>If you’re not brewing tea, Wanderstop goes all Animal Crossing, having you titivate the small area that surrounds the café. You sweep up fallen leaves, snip away brambles and weeds, and water your plants, before having a brew, and then putting a cup in the best dishwasher ever created. Seriously, it’s the <em>best</em>.</p>

<p>Wanderstop continues to plow its games-as-therapy through its 10-hour runtime, and I think its impact will depend on your own experiences with mental health, exhaustion and burnout. If you’ve been through these things, you’ll recognise yourself in Alta’s behaviour, and the tea-making and restful moments here feel like therapy.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it’s a gentle and easy-going form of therapy, but it’s therapy nonetheless. It can be difficult to see yourself in her actions and reactions, and I occasionally longed for Wanderstop just be a game about tea and beautiful foliage, rather than pain. There’s catharsis to those emotions though, and as she works through it, you learn or are reminded to be kinder to yourself. It’s proof once more that games are capable of being so much more than purely entertainment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/april-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-robocop-texas-chainsaw-digimon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for April 2025 have been announced and fans of 80s action films will be delighted to see the inclusion of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">RoboCop: Rogue City.</a> The future of law enforcement might have a bit of a time going up against the 70s horror icon that is Leatherface, though.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be April 1st – no kidding – and they will be available until May 5th.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>RoboCop: Rogue City | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</strong><strong> | PS4&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RoboCop is the headline act here, with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-channels-the-raid-in-this-standalone-expansion/">the standalone expansion RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business</a>. Set between the second and third films, RoboCop methodically stomps around town on the trail of a new drug gang and peel back a new mystery while blasting everything in sight into smithereens. The game has passed a significant milestone with Nacon proudly touting over 1 million players since launch.</p>
<div>
<p>It’s a game that’s divided opinion a little amongst our writers. A few of us have had a great time with it, getting exactly what they want out of a RoboCop game – one-note bipedal cop-bot action – while others were a little less enraptured by this.</p>


</div>
<p>Then there’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, one of the multitude of asymmetrical multiplayer horror games out there, based on the iconic 1974 film. A group of survivors has to complete tasks and avoid being caught, while one member of the Slaughter Family stalks through the maps and tries to capture all of their ‘guests’. Launching back in 2023, PS Plus will provide a fresh batch of players, and in our review Steve said, “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a fantastic homage to the original film and really shines in its general presentation, but the gaming experience itself proves to be a frustrating one.”</p>

<p>Lastly there’s 2017’s Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory. Accused of a crime he didn’t commit,&nbsp;Keisuke Amazawa has to head into the Digital World to prove his innocence, joining a group of hackers &nbsp;while finding, raising and battling with over 320 Digimon.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the March 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 31st March to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP0006-PPSA01390_00-DRAGON4STANDBUND">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0177-CUSA19351_00-SONICCOLORSULTIM">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0101-PPSA04490_00-TMNTCOWABUNGAXXX">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> | PS4, PS5</strong></li>

		<p>Amazon’s Luna game streaming service is expanding to Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg today, the service will now be available in fourteen countries.&nbsp; Those who have Amazon Prime get a free taster selection of games with Fortnite,&nbsp;LEGO Fortnite,&nbsp;Rocket Racing, and Trackmania available all year, and a rotating selection of games per month. March 2025 includes WRC Generations,&nbsp;Overcooked! 2,&nbsp;Spitlings,&nbsp;The Jackbox Party Pack 3, and&nbsp;Strange Horticulture,.</p>
<p>Luna also announced a partnership with EA which will see some of the publisher’s games join Luna. &nbsp;Starting today,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and&nbsp;Dead Space are available to Luna+ subscribers, “with more games coming soon.” This will include “More of EA’s popular franchises, including select games from the EA SPORTS portfolio.”</p>


<p>“Our teams are focused on building experiences that entertain and engage EA’s massive online communities, and we’re excited to partner with Amazon to make those games available to even more people,” said David Tinson, EVP and Chief Experiences Officer, Electronic Arts. “We look forward to a selection of EA games joining Amazon Luna, offering new ways for players and fans to come together across a variety of devices they already own, wherever they are.”</p>
<p>This does mean EA games are available on both EA Play and Amazon Luna but as Luna only has a few older games it’s probably not going to significantly impact subscription to the EA service.</p>

<p>We took a look at Amazon Luna back in 2023 when it launched, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/14/amazon-luna-review-can-you-buy-streaming-success/">you can read our thoughts here.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode-later-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has announced, for the tenth anniversary of its release, that their decade-old CRPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> is getting a new turn-based combat mode later this year.</p>
<p>The announcement came alongside an update to the game to coincide with its anniversary, fixing a smattering of issues, such as GOG Achievements not working, improving 4K resolution support and more. That’s a nice update, but the big change is with the upcoming turn-based combat mode.</p>


<p>“We’ve been hard at work delving deep into the code grimoire and tuning the balance of blade and spell—and today, we’re excited to share the results of that effort with a brand new patch,” <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the team writes in their forums</a>. This update addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more. Whether you’re journeying through the Eastern Reach for the first time or returning to tie up loose threads, your path should now be a little smoother.</p>
<p>“But that’s not all—we have something special on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Coming later this year, Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: Turn-Based Combat. We’re excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future. More details on how to participate will be shared in the near future, so keep an eye on our socials and in our Discord.”</p>

<p>Before there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a>, Obsidian founded their original fantasy universe with the Kickstarter-backed Pillars of Eternity. This was a smaller budget throwback to classic CRPGs, in tone and general style.</p>
<p>Pillars of Eternity was a game with real-time combat and pause at launch, meaning that you could still have plenty of time to make your decisions and enact them, but with a fundamentally real-time underpinning. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review/">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>, meanwhile, introduced an optional turn-based combat mode, which is now being rolled back to the original game. It’s sure to be a popular option, giving players that more traditional D&amp;D-style experience and more deterministic decision-making – you’ll no longer have to factor in time for movement and tick down second on ability cooldowns.</p>
<p>Digging back into our own archives to find our review of Pillars of Eternity, Gareth said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">the 2017 Complete Edition console port</a>, “Pillars of Eternity is a stellar entry into its genre, but one that won’t win over people who are not already fans. It is huge and richly detailed, with more history than some actual periods of real life, and a rare amount of care and attention. It’s probably a better experience on a PC, but it’s still definitely worth playing on console if it’s your only option.”</p>

		<p>I’m on my travels to play a game today, which I can actually tell you about next week. So with plenty of time while waiting for and while on various modes of transportation, I’ve been playing a bunch of retro stuff on a bunch of retro handhelds, including the Retroid Pocket 5. It’s mostly been Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy 9, both of which I haven’t played for a long time, and I’m enjoying rediscovering the stories of each. Besides that, it’s been more Yakuza: Like a Dragon, some Wanderstop, and I checked out the extremely promising <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has played Assassin’s Creed Shadows this week, which he says, “Definitely adds some cool refined mechanics to the series, but has way too much filler for my liking. It would be easier to overlook if the main story and characters were a lot more interesting – hopefully it’s just a case of Shadows getting off to a slow start. Either way, Ubisoft’s depiction of feudal Japan is stunning in its historical authenticity and natural beauty, supercharged by immersive weather and lighting effects. I also appreciate the various game settings on hand, allowing insta-kills with the hidden blade and switching off the guided exploration.”</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Because, of course he has, but <strong>Gamoc</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall</a> for our review and enjoyed wrapping up its British flavoured sci-fi mystery. Otherwise, he’s also been playing more AC Shadows, which he says is great! He told us, “I might need to turn the difficulty up though as stealth and combat are a bit too easy. Also played Phasmophobia, where I’m level 100 and about to prestige, it is still perhaps the single biggest surprise I’ve had in games – I didn’t think I’d like it so much at all.”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had a quieter week, just diving into his favourites in the shape of Witcher 3 and Football Manager. <strong>Tef</strong> has had more time, greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a>. He says, “It’s become my mindless chillout game. The playerbase feels like it’s at the stage where it can pretty easily smash through the first level and boss with ease, and I’m making my way through levelling up all the weapons and things. It really is like a bitesized version of farming an MMO raid.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round this week out with <strong>Steve</strong> who finished Avowed. He says it was, “Decent but felt like it dragged a little by the end. I perhaps made the combat too simple by focusing too much on two handed sword and rifle which made most fights a walkover. Sounds like pistol and grimoire is the most fun way to play.” That wasn’t all he had time for though, continuing, “I also rattled through the very silly old school shooter Slayers X and followed that up with some Mullet Madjack which is a great adrenaline-filled Crank shooter. I have carried on trying to plough through Lego Star Wars Skywalker but there is just so much to do that I’m not sure I can be bothered to 100% it – something I’ve done with every other Lego game (apart from the terrible Lego Movie 2 one). I also finished Dancing Panda and Your House for reviews which should be up next week. I’m installing Atomfall for my next big game.”</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/checking-out-the-ugreen-x-genshin-impact-collection/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While there are plenty of game series plastered over perfumes, candles or food, sometimes collaborations actually make a good deal of sense, companies joining forces to make something that serves them both. Chinese electronics manufacturer <a href="https://uk.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-uk-collab-event">UGREEN</a> have done exactly that, teaming up with <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/">Genshin Impact</a> in order to deliver a batch of phone accessories that are designed to keep you playing for a very, very long time. They’ve also been thoroughly Genshined. Or is that Impacted?</p>

<p>Our press reveal for this kit came in a very large box, with everything nestling inside matching the green and black livery of the Kinich-inspired Genshin theme. The three bits of tech inside are all available separately or in this Limited Edition gift box form – <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-kinich-series">which you can win</a> – where UGREEN have pulled them together, so, you’re getting a 65W GaN fast charger ($27.99), a 20,000mAh Nexode quick charge power bank ($69.99) and a 15W Qi2 wireless charger ($41.99), all wrapped up with a suitably lurid 100W-certified USB-C cable.</p>


<p>The 20,000mAh power bank is more like a power brick, housing four 5000mAh batteries in series. It’s the most insane charging bank I’ve ever personally come across, not just thanks to the excellent Genshin Impact livery, but because it also houses a full-colour TFT screen. This tells you exactly what it’s doing, so alongside letting you know when it’s charging, it can tell you how much juice it’s pumping out of the three ports in its rear. And that can be seriously impressive got a 100W USB-C outlet, a standard 30W USB-C one, and a 22.5W USB-A port as well. While it’s all very interesting – I could watch numbers go up and down all day – I wasn’t able to realise the 100W experience, topping out at 18.9W over USB-C.</p>


<p>Whatever the reality of it charging my fast-charge approved Honor Magic V3, it was very fast, taking my phone from 40% to 100% in 30 minutes, while using up around 20% of its own charge. You can plug three devices in at the same time, and here the Nexode Power Bank can reach a maximum output of 130W, letting you charge your phone, your laptop and your headphones at the same time. It’s been a perfect companion when I’ve been travelling recently, letting me game on my phone without any worries of my boarding ticket not working when I reach the gate.</p>
<p>When it’s not showing you charging data, the power bank shows cheerful little animations of itself wearing headphones, which is cute. Beyond the three ports and the screen, the sole other interface is the control button which wakes it up, and lets you cycle through a little more power bank data, if you need some graphs with your numbers. In a further nod to its Genshin Impact-approved status, you also get little pixel-art animations of Ajaw too which should delight fans.</p>

<p>In terms of outputs, it’s a similar story with the 65W 3-port charger. You’ve got three ports here with the two USB-C sockets for most modern tech, and a USB-A port for older bits and bobs. The two USB-C ports can max out at 65W individually, auto-negotiating to whatever your device can handle, or will split down to 45W and 20W if both are used together. The USB-A port tops out at 22.5W, and if you’re using everything, then the ports drop to 45W, 8.5W and 8.5W. That’s a little short of the brick’s maximum, but will still be more than capable of charging all your kit up overnight.</p>
<p>The final component in the gift set is the 15W Magflow Wireless Charger which folds out to give you adjustable viewing. It’s a Qi2 charger and MagSafe certified to give the fastest wireless charging for the latest phones, while using the wizardry of magnets to keep everything locked in place, regardless of how you angle the top mount – very handy if you want to watch something while falling asleep! Lifting that up also exposes a dinky little nook at the bottom that can charger up some AirPods at 5W, and there’s a 5W USB-C passthrough on the side that’s meant for charging an Apple Watch, but can really be used for any low-power USB-C charging.</p>

<p>All these items feel utterly rock solid, and boast some serious manufacturing expertise. It feels as though you’ll have to put them through some serious punishment to scratch or damage the Genshin Impact imagery too, so they should stay looking as luminous and unique as they do when you take them out of the box.</p>
<p>UGREEN have put together a really cool batch of Genshin Impact-inspired devices, and if you’re a fan of the game who’s in need of some extra juice to keep those pulls going, this is the perfect collaboration for you. Of course, they’re all just branded versions of UGREEN’s graphite grey gear, in case you want more subtle looking charging tech instead.</p>
