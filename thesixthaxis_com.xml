		<p>Tron: Catalyst, the new game from Bithell Games, publisher Big Fan and Disney, has a release date, this digital world thriller coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and PC on 17th June 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDRwx2qK-74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer gave us a closer look at Exo, the game’s protagonist, who’s found herself with the cursed gift of being able to perceive the glitch that is affecting the Arq Grid, letting her loop time back around on itself, and lending her unique abilities in combat. Glitches will allow you the ability to roll back time, rewinding events and using time loops that only you can see to uncover secret areas and shortcuts, as well as manipulate the factions in the game’s story.</p>
<p>It’s a Bithell game, so you know that one of the strengths is going to be the narrative – the studio previously explored the setting with the well-received Tron: Identity visual novel – though they’re getting back to creating something a bit more action-oriented. There’s various factions looking to hunt Exo down, such as the Peacekeepers and the malevolent prgram Conn, both of which are hot on Exo’s heels throughout.</p>

<p>And it wouldn’t be a Tron game without a bit of Light Cycle action, would it? The demo shows off some Light Cycle exploration in the city of Vertical Slice.</p>
