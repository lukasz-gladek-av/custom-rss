		<p>As is tradition at this point, I have played a ridiculous number of demos in readiness for the launch of the Steam Next Fest. Many of these were interesting, whilst a depressing number were either non-functional, riddled with AI slop, or, in the case of horror games, eerily repetitive due to taking place in the same Unity asset house that I’ve seen countless times before. Those negative aspects aside, there are a load of great-looking titles on the horizon and here’s my top 10 horror demos (notable titles Holstin and Tormented Souls 2 will be getting their own posts once I’ve played them).</p>

<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Caput Mortem</a></h3>
<p>Caput Mortum is an immersive sim with an innovative control scheme and a fantastic sense of atmosphere. Your hand is controlled by the right stick while camera controls are carried out through the shoulder buttons. This takes a little getting used to and makes the combat extra challenging but the puzzle-solving potential is obvious. The 16<sup>th</sup>-century setting is an extra bonus.</p>

<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767530/Wicked_Seed/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Wicked Seed</a></h3>
<p>Wicked Seed brings a novel fusion of traditional survival horror and JRPG in a modern third-person perspective. The generous demo contains a significant slice of the game and shows the depth of the combat and an interesting range of puzzles. Whilst a little rough around the edges, this shows immense potential.</p>


<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835690/The_Demons_Told_Me_to_Make_This_Game/">The Demons Told Me to Make This Game</a></h2>
<p>This one like a knowing horror take on the RPG/adventure stylings of Disco Elysium as you control a spirit who must possess humans to prevent a demonic catastrophe. Whilst dying is normally the end in games, here it becomes a learning opportunity as you reverse time and use your knowledge to take things in a different direction. Witty and clever, I’m keen to see how complex the time management becomes in the full version.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Demons Told Me to Make This Game - Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VucibRZS8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2768030/Saborus/">Saborus</a></h3>
<p>Saborus sees you take on the role of a chicken trying to escape from a sinister meat-packing facility. Whilst the human workers are a terrifying threat in and of themselves, there is also a strange conspiracy at work trying to use genetic experimentation to create freakishly large animals to maximise production. Whilst I initially thought this was a meme game, it actually plays pretty well with your chicken being able to pick up objects in its beak and wander across computer keyboards to activate machinery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saborus - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X and Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRAec9RGu-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975680/__Revelation_of_Decay/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Revelation of Decay</a></h3>
<p>This top-down pixel survival game is equal parts Stardew Valley and Days Gone with added co-op potential. While the demo establishes the main controls, it is obvious that this is a game that could consume you if you let it, with an absolute wealth of mechanics and content. I’m certainly keen to get my online friends involved (even if just to stop them playing the awful 7 Days to Die!)</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Revelation of Decay: A Pixel-Style Survival Video Game Incorporating Farming and Fighting Zombies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSNHt2PrFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3462190/PHASE_ZERO/">Phase Zero</a></h2>
<p>A traditional Resident Evil PSX clone with graphics and controls to match. The combat is super challenging in this build, whilst puzzles are fresh but familiar enough for genre fans to appreciate. The demo takes place in a hospital, which feels perfectly on point, but there are plenty of new touches to distinguish it from the games that clearly influence it. Above all else, finishing the demo unlocks a legs-only character model, which indicates the devs have a keen sense of the absurdity of the best classic survival horror games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PHASE ZERO - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1h-GV6rfgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3197890/LURKS_WITHIN_WALLS/">Lurks Within Walls</a></h3>
<p>Lurks Within Walls is another genre fusion, in this case taking survival horror and mixing it up with classic grid-based dungeon crawling. The end result is a game that cleverly combines the best of both genres to give a real sense of fragility and claustrophobia.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LURKS WITHIN WALLS | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSCKJO84w4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/">Ferocious</a></h3>
<p>Ferocious is the latest game to capitalise on the terrifying potential of dinosaurs, this time emphasising the survival part of survival horror. When you are capsized on a mysterious island, you must venture forth to find your brother. Along your path, you’ll discover ancient ruins, oversized insects, mercenary gangs and lethal carnivorous dinosaurs. The demo itself is a little too focused on human enemies, but the systems feel soli,d and the potential for prehistoric enemies in this genre is clear.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ferocious Gameplay Trailer  - Open Playtest Just Started! | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0nB4Hf8zC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Eclipsium</a></h3>
<p>Eclipsium is one of the most visually striking games I’ve played in a while. Standard first-person exploration is elevated by a highly dithered artstyle that feels like a fever dream. This style is appropriate as the game itself appears to take place in a dreamworld and dying sees you wake up in your bedroom again only to step out of the door and find yourself back in the dream. The demo is largely focused on puzzle solving but has a fantastic sense of atmosphere to accompany the visuals.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eclipsium Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMHF5I7p3GU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3511700/Flesh_Made_Fear_Demo/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Flesh Made Fear</a></h3>
<p>Another classic Resident Evil clone, but one that absolutely nails the atmosphere and feel of the original series. You play as one of two alternative members of the special R.I.P. squad and must track down a sinister scientist and prevent him from bringing about a catastrophe. However, it soon becomes clear that you may be too late as you face hordes of shambling zombies and other more dangerous mutations. Everything from the controls to the voice acting screams classic Resi and this sizeable demo really shows off the feel of the game.</p>

<p><em>As always, new demos are being added to the Next Fest as it begins so let me know in the comments if any other interesting horror games have caught your eye. Next up I’ll have a list of other more general games that I enjoyed!</em></p>
