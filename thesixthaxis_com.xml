			<p>One of the worst things is when you see potential and promise in something, but it doesn’t reach the heights you know it can. That is probably the best way to describe my experience with Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon, the dark fantasy open world RPG which uses the King Arthur legend as the basis for the setting and story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon begins strongly. You are a no-name character who is suffering from disease and is locked up on Asylum Island. You are freed by a mysterious character, but they do not help guide you to freedom, instead leaving you to figure out the path through the dangers for yourself.</p>


<p>It is only as you are broken out that you actually create your character, answering questions about what you were doing prior to ending up in the cell. Answering these questions feeds into which attributes get a boost at the beginning, and the playstyle you are considering. At the start you are weak, and Tainted Grail does an excellent job of showing just how that works as different enemy types cross your path and you are almost helpless to beat them, requiring quick thinking or running away.</p>
<p>Once you are away from Asylum Island and the first proper area, Horns of the South, things really do open up. There is the main quest to follow, which involves recovering some of King Arthur’s relics to restore his soul. Arthur’s soul just so happens to be in your body as a passenger and allows you to access various powers and abilities. You can also talk to him at bonfires and get his story, which comes in fragments since his memory is tied to the artifacts.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon has a lot of side quests and content within the world too. Many of the quests are pretty well put together and a few have some interesting and fun ways to resolve them, provided you meet the skill checks. You can tell the team have put the effort in to write some entertaining characters too, and the acting is decent too though not quite top tier.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon gives you some decent combat options. You can choose to use a sword and shield, dual wield weapons or spells, and combine them so you have a melee weapon in one hand and magic spells in the other. You can also put a few different combinations together so you can switch between quickly. For my playthrough I regularly used spell and sword, with two different combos. One allowed me to summon creatures while dealing heavy damage, while another featured a sword that had life steal and a spell that also stole health from enemies, which can be unstoppable at times.</p>
<p>The efficiency of your spells, weapons, armour are all linked to your attributes. As you level up you will get points to upgrade your attributes, be it physical, perception, spirituality, dexterity, and more, providing a baseline of stats to go alongside skills that you unlock in relation to these categories. Early on you can experiment, but as time goes on you should start focusing on a playstyle to really take full advantage. However, if you get bored of a particular style you can use an Origin potion to reset your points.</p>

<p>There’s something distinctly Oblivion to the visual style of Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon – the original, I mean, and not the remake. There is a good amount of things to discover within the world to discover, such as with dungeons that are hidden in plain sight. The Horns of the South is full of ruins showing how it has been ignored by Kamelot, while the second area of Cunacht has the show of somewhere falling apart as Kamelot tries to move everyone while locals want to stay. However, there is a clear quality divide between these regions, where Horns of the South just feels far more detailed in comparison to Cunacht.&nbsp;It gives a sense that Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is quite front loaded.</p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon’s technical issues cannot be ignored, despite the regular patches that are being released. The game crashes multiple times, which can be triggered by moving from one place to another, or for some non-obvious reason. There is flickering in the environment that is distracting. There is also a bit of a weird issue when swimming where even if it looks like you are underwater, the oxygen bar doesn’t appear. On occasion, my summons did not engage with enemies or got stuck. Luckily, you can resummon so that is not a big deal, but you would still want it to be better.</p>

		<p>Stellar Blade shattered expectations when it arrived as a PlayStation 5 exclusive last year. Despite being the debut console title from Korean gacha game developer Shift-up, the game was knocking it out of the park with striking gameplay, incredible music, and gorgeous high-definition visuals that stood confidently alongside Sony’s first-party heavy hitters like God of War and Spider-man. The fervor around an eventual PC port of this game has been bustling since it released. As someone who only ever played a demo of the original PlayStation 5 release, this PC port combined with it’s bundled assortment of crossover DLC served as my wake-up call to finally dive in. And across my desktop PC and my Steam Deck OLED, Stellar Blade has impressed me on every level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The graphics and display options on offer here are comparable to other Sony PC ports in how exhaustive and detailed the list of settings to tweak are. Resolution scaling will be set to either NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-FSR-TECH-PREVIEW.html">FSR 4</a> or FSR 3, depending on the GPU you use. FSR 3 is the universal option, comparable to the upscaling used on PS5, while FSR 4 is closer to DLSS in how it works and exclusive to the new Radeon RX 9000 GPUs.</p>


<p>With upscaling enabled, the game raced to an average 90-100 FPS when played at 1440P with max graphics settings on my GeForce RTX 3080. A couple cutscenes full of lots of monsters would cause minor dips, but they were rare and I never felt like the resolution scaling was a distraction. This can even be combined with DLSS frame generation, the game easily hit smooth framerates without major graphical downgrades.</p>


<p>What blew me away, though, was that even with resolution scaling turned completely off, the game was able to maintain a locked 60FPS at 1440P nearly the entire time. As is typicaly, the RTX 3080 easily outperforms every base PlayStation 5 graphics mode, which relied on scaling solutions to hit those targets. Playing any new games at 4K and a steady FPS feels like a pipe dream unless you’ve got a beefy rig or generate half your frames, but Stellar Blade shows a level of optimisation that so few AAA games nowadays do.</p>
<p>Even better, this all means the game is great on Steam Deck. So many recent Sony PC ports require a lot of visual compromise to just barely run on the Valve’s handheld PC, but Stellar Blade feels like it was made for this form factor. The game stays at a steady framerate and maintains a shocking amount of it’s original visual detail and quality.</p>

<p>Packed in alongside the base game content is a duology of crossover DLC with other games that carry a similar thematic through-line of “if android, why hot?” – Square Enix’s&nbsp;Nier Automata&nbsp;an Shift-up’s own title&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory.&nbsp;Both DLC are more a collection of easter eggs and bonus activities than they are a massive expansion or story continuation. If you’re a fan of either property though, the amount of references and call-backs and familiar costumes tossed in from each game are a delight. The&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory&nbsp;DLC in particular, which launched alongside this port, includes a new fishing mini-game, a cover-shooter mission series replicating the gameplay from the fanservice-filled gacha game, and an entire new boss fight against a major character from that title. My only complaint? No love for my favorite&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;character, Elegg. BOOM is life.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade&nbsp;is incredible on PC, and doesn’t compromise at all on any of the quality from the original PlayStation 5 release. For existing fans, the upgrades in resolution and framerate potential are a revelation and the new&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;dlc is a blast. For those who haven’t played the game yet, this is easily the most accessible and versatile way to check it out.</p>

		<p>It’s been a long and busy week, with last weekend being a mad juggle of trying to play as much Switch 2 as possible while also covering Summer Game Fest streams and showcases. The Switch 2 gaming has continued through to this week, as Dom and I led the charge on doing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">a broad look at backward compatibility games</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077’s impressive port</a>, and I published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/">hardware review</a> after gathering my thoughts from the first week.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty more Switch 2 stuff to do, though. I’ll soon be telling you about how the Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a “transfigurational” port. Can you tell that I’m happy with this reference?</p>

<p>For some reason, I asked everyone to tell me relay their week’s gaming while making it rhyme. Not everyone was up to the task, but we did get some nice poems.</p>
<p>Here’s <strong>Ade</strong>:</p>

<p><em>For review I played Alter, and I didn’t falter. It was very hard, like frozen lard, but I saw it through to the end, and confirm that money on it people should spend.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> was more of a limerick:</p>
<p><em>I played Switch 2 with my wife</em><br>
<em>I thought to myself ‘what a life!’</em><br>
<em>But I didn’t let her win</em><br>
<em>My Switch 2 is in the bin</em><br>
<em>Who knew Mario Kart causes such strife?</em></p>
<p>And here’s <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> effort:</p>
<p><em>I start by playing Balatro,</em><br>
<em>Then Warhammer, I’m sure you know,</em><br>
<em>But then I remembered a review,</em><br>
<em>That is what I should do,</em><br>
<em>So I looked at Baldur’s Gate and said no!</em></p>
<p><em>Instead I played Zombie Army,</em><br>
<em>And after that the Atomfall DLC,</em><br>
<em>The reviews will come soon,</em><br>
<em>Before the full moon,</em><br>
<em>Because then a werewolf I’ll be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’m a werewolf.</em></p>
<p>Sadly nobody else was willing to take on this task, <strong>Steve</strong> even said that these efforts caused him “significant discomfort as a lecturer in English Lit and Creative Writing.” So we’re back to the boring land of basic prose, and he played “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ten-horror-game-demos-to-chill-and-thrill-you-in-steam-next-fest-this-week/">a whole bunch of Steam demos</a> and put a few hours into Mario Kart World.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Mario Kart World, <strong>Nic’s</strong> son decided to add a little bit of “4D haptics” to his gaming by whacking him in the Mushroom Kingdom’s crown jewels. Ouch! He also played Split Fiction, Survival Kids and Bravely Default’s remake on Switch 2, with reviews for them all still in the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> tired of playing games where he wasn’t the named protagonist, so went back to Blades of Fire to fight some things. He’s also reviewed Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, which is a good game marred by so many technical issues.</p>
<p>After checking out Nioh 3’s demo some more, and revisiting Dynasty Warriors: Origins for a Shu playthrough, <strong>Jim</strong> moved on to the Cairn demo. “It’s a truly unique game about climbing a mountain, from the devs who created the fantastic Furi, that somehow manages to be zen and infuriating at the same time. I’m looking forward to playing the full release though I’m hoping the performance improves drastically on PS5 (the demo was super choppy).”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> got to keep quiet about Death Stranding 2 a little longer.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>
