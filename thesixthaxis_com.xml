		<p>Already a major hit with record-breaking franchise sales, EA has kicked off a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Free Trial. This is live now and running from today, 25th November, until 2nd December at 4 a.m. PT (12 p.m. UTC)</p>
<p>To play the Free Trial, you need to download the free-to-play Battlefield REDSEC, which will have access to more modes and maps granted for the coming week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 | Free Trial Week" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NllG1jzar4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Battlefield 6 Free Trial features a subset of the maps and modes in the full game, putting an emphasis on the Season 1 content, and obviously doesn’t include the single player campaign (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign/">but you can probably skip that</a>). Free-to-play players will get to check out&nbsp;Siege of Cairo, Blackwell Fields, and the newly released Eastwood, and get to try them out in modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, Team Deathmatch, and Sabotage.&nbsp;Of course, you also already have the free-to-play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">Battlefield REDSEC battle royale mode</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, there’s already cross-pollination of unlocks and levels. Anything unlocked in REDSEC can be used in the Free Trial, and anything you unlock in the Free Trial is kept and carried through should you buy the full game.</p>

<p>The timing of this is pretty much perfect for EA to capitalise on the missteps made by their biggest rival, and as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the US. It’s a great time to try and convince more people to join this shooter and not the other.</p>

			<p>It’s pretty staggering just how consistent the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> franchise has been over the last two decades. A new game every single year, bouncing back and forth between studios and sub-series, it’s remained at the top of the FPS genre for three console generations. But maybe that crown is slipping? Maybe we need to start thinking of them in terms of even and odd-numbered <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-trek">Star Trek</a> movies? <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> is not an even number…</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight) [UK]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX8T2nqPjno?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Black Ops 7 Multiplayer</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the real heart of the Call of Duty franchise and Black Ops 7’s multiplayer. A year on from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, and this is largely a continuation from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">the highs</a> of that game. You still have the omnidirectional movement that keeps everything fast and fluid, you still have the solid loadout system with perk synergies building to specialisations, and you’ve got plenty of maps that generally lean in on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/treyarch">Treyarch</a>‘s strong lane-based design style.</p>


<p>Many of the maps also take advantage of the main addition to this year’s gameplay: wall-jumping. We’re far from the excesses of the jetpack era of Call of Duty, but this is a nice nod to those sci-fi infused titles, giving a little more verticality, a snifter of additional movement flexibility. Of course, the near-future setting means you’ve also got more turrets, robot DAWGs, active camo, and a killstreak that gives you a gun to shoot through walls – it’s feels filthy to see yourself get sniped like this on a deathcam, but compared to other killstreaks, it’s really no more or less lethal.</p>


<p>In general, the TTK does feel a little faster again, which combined with the speed of motion could be pushing this game out of your comfort zone, but if the 6v6 Call of Duty multiplayer is all you want in life, then Black Ops 7 has you covered. But what if you want something bigger, with vehicles and more tactical? No, please don’t leave! Uh, there’s the 20v20 Skirmish mode!</p>
<p>This tries to cover off that large-scale battle angle, with two big maps, vehicles and a rolling set of capture, destroy, takeover and escort objectives. If anything, it ramps the pace up even further, since you spawn high in the sky and can wingsuit to pretty much wherever you like on the map, even barrelling straight through windows and into objective zones. Far from being an antidote to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, though, it’s all too often just madcap and finds itself in this no-man’s land between these rival franchises.</p>

<h2>The Co-op Campaign &amp; Endgame</h2>
<p>After the good, even great showings in the last two Black Ops games for their single player campaigns, Black Ops 7 is a major misstep. We’re jumping ahead from the Cold War and Gulf War to a decade after the events of Black Ops 2 and returning to David Mason and his team. The story tugs on narrative threads from across the series, mixing in the Cradle from Black Ops 6 for a twisted sci-fi psychological thriller. Except it’s just not even remotely thrilling.</p>

<p>The campaign bounces back and forth between sections set in the open world map of Avalon, which is filled with bland human and robot soldiers for The Guild, and then nightmare reimaginings of events from each character’s past. That means revisiting plot points from Black Ops 2, such as a version of the Battle for LA with roads twisting through the air all Inception-style, or fighting a giant version of Harper on the deck of an aircraft carrier, but it even goes back to fighting zombies in a rerun of the Vorkuta prison break.</p>
<p>I’m all for Call of Duty experimenting with the format of the campaign, and the Black Ops series has done this more often than not, with narrative branches, side missions, hubs, and more. Black Ops 7 just misses the mark, from enemies having health bars, to not having AI buddies when playing solo, and just how bland The Guild are as enemies and how rote the horror monsters are.</p>

<p>It soon becomes clear that this was, in part, about leading into the Endgame co-op mode, taking the template from Modern Warfare III’s Zombies in a different thematic direction. This gives you the full map of Avalon to play in as an extraction shooter, gating areas behind the level and gear of your chosen Operator, doling out missions and then having you get out safely with everything you’ve found.</p>
<p>It’s purely PvE, with dozens of other players able to team up on the fly and take on the higher-level missions and scenarios, and there’s some fun Cradle effects, like a random little game of prop hunt. But it’s really not exciting building up to the end of the Endgame events, as you’re largely fighting against fairly boring enemies and completing basic missions. There’s also the tonal whiplash you felt throughout the campaign, as zombies and other fantastical elements are thrown in for the heck of it.</p>
<h2>Black Ops 7 Zombies</h2>
<p>The more traditional home of co-op in Call of Duty is its Zombies mode, with Black Ops 7 picking up the convoluted Dark Aether narrative from last year’s game. The Ashes of the Damned map is huge, with six key areas to reach and explore, joined up by a bunch of roads and other smaller points of interest shrouded in The Fog. It’s big enough, in fact, that you need to hop into a pick-up truck –&nbsp;nicknamed Ol’ Tessie –&nbsp;to get around. She’s a battered workhorse of a truck, able to smash through hordes of zombies, but only for a limited time before she takes too much damage and needs repairs. Later upgrades, though, put a mean turret on top and Abomination Heads that can blast streams of zombie-frying lightning.</p>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is that it means your co-op party really needs to be on the same page. Anyone can jump into the truck and just drive off, leaving others with a sprint through the danger-filled Fog, unless they happen to be at the garage in the Ashwood area, where you can summon Tessie back or teleport to her for a fee. You really want to play this mode with friends and voice chat, especially if you’re trying to follow the Easter Egg story path.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s other ways to play. If you prefer the classic Zombies feel, you can play Cursed mode and start off with just a pistol, while a Directed mode for the main quest is coming soon. There’s also a pure Survival mode, which takes the Farmyard section of Ashes of the Damned, and simply gives you waves to battle through. No frills, no nonsense, just classic Zombies on a pretty confined map, and since I’m really not invested in the story, it’s really my preferred way to play this mode.</p>

<p>There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade, the top-down zombie shooter which puts over-the-top weaponry in your hands at every opportunity and progresses through a nonsensical quest with apes and chickens. You can actually play it in first person the whole time now, and some power-ups will still switch you to this view anyway. There’s tons of rooms to battle through, tons of excess, and it’s easy to slide into, but it doesn’t really feel novel anymore. Dead Ops Arcade was a secret mode for a secret mode just as indie games and retro aesthetics were coming into their own in the early 2010s, but 15 years later and the indie scene has moved on to explore many more genres, mash-ups and riff on these ideas in more engaging ways.</p>

		<p>The first episode for Subnautica 2’s tie in audio drama Voices from Beyond is now available to listen to, and this episode is called Don’t Fear. The Voices from Beyond story follows a family from the universe who are settled in a Mongolian settlement, as they work out how to live in a constantly shifting world unaware there is a big threat hurtling towards them.</p>

<p>Subnautica 2 Voices from Beyond stars Griffin Puata as the Dad/Mongolian Politician, Hester Lee as Mom/Alterra Engineer, Jessika Van as the Daughter/Singer, Nell Barnes as Baby/Young Daughter, Dan Gordon as Ryley Robinson/Podcast Host, Emily O’Brien as Radio News Host #1 / PSA Announcer / Admiral Rathine Studaber, and Townsend Coleman as Radio News Host #2 / Alterra Advertiser.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders/">Subnautica 2 early access was delayed to 2026</a>, a few months ago with lots of drama surrounding the studio and the game. Krafton replaced the co-founders and leaders of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer Unknown Worlds. Krafton accused studio founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire of effectively abandoning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2’s</a>&nbsp;development to focus on other projects – including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">an independent movie by Cleveland with a podcast and… uh… AI-generated movie posters</a> – despite repeated requests by Krafton for them to return to work. But in another twist, &nbsp;Jason Schreier suggested that along with the Christmas film, Cleveland was also working on a Subnautica film for Krafton. “In the lawsuit, they argue that Krafton was aware of their roles and that Cleveland was working on a Subnautica film — that Krafton requested.”</p>

<p>All of this has ended up with Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire suing Krafton, with new allegations that the Krafton CEO used ChatGPT to find ways to avoid paying a £250 million bonus, and also discussed a company takeover in Slack. It will be a little while before we know the final outcome of the court case.</p>
