		<p>Raw Fury and developer Ground Shatter have announced that their pun-tastic medieval sequel Knights in Tight Spaces is coming to PC on 4th March. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/">A demo is available to play now on Steam</a>, and you can wishlist to note support for the game.</p>

<p>Knights in Tight Spaces is, obviously, a successor to the more business suit brawling of Fights in Tight Spaces, but looks to take that idea to a whole new realm. A fantasy realm.</p>
<p>You’ll still be battling it out with enemies in small arenas, but this time it’s knights, rangers and wizards fighting against skeletons, banshee, bandits, other knights and more. Your main character is the titular knight, but you can hire others to fight alongside you, join a secret society (or not) and then see how far you can get in the roguelite format of this game.</p>
<p>All of your actions are determined by the cards in your hand, but they now combine with the different classes and gear you’ve equipped. you also need to be mindful of your surroundings, carefully positioning yourself around enemies and obstacles to get a tactical advantage, building up combos to release special moves.</p>

<p>We loved the first game in this series, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/02/fights-in-tight-spaces-review/">our Fights in Tight Spaces review</a>, “Fights in Tight Spaces is a really unique and stylish take on the deck building genre with a level of strategy on offer that will be enough to keep people coming back for a long time. Fights in Tight Spaces is worth your attention.”</p>
