		<p>With rumours and reports of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake having circulated for years at this point, the latest has come directly from developer Virtuos, with screenshots and details coming from their website.</p>
<p>Further to the screenshots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer has also now reported</a> that Bethesda’s plan is to shadow drop the game next week, launching it across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and on Xbox Game Pass, of course.</p>


<p>The images were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they’ve now been <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">copied across to imgur</a>, while the studio has taken their site offline. We’ll point you toward imgur if you want to see the full selection, but here’s one example:</p>

<p>There’s definitely an awful lot more detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>

<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>I guess we won’t have too long to wait…</p>
