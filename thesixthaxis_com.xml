		<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch for PS5 on 2nd October 2025, Sucker Punch delivering the long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> five years on from their PS4 samurai epic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - The Onryō’s List | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. Set in the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603, there’s a real Western vibe to some of the scenery and imagery that has been used for the game’s trailers.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a new Ghost to play as, named Atsu. Hers, as is so often the case for this kind of fiction, is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down&nbsp;The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>
<p>Sucker Punch explain, though, that this isn’t purely about revenge, and that through this tale she will make new allies, forge connections to the people and the land, and look to gain a new sense of purpose for once she’s finished killing the bad guys. It sounds thoroughly wholesome.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the game will start on 2nd May, with a standard price of £69.99 / $69.99 / €79.99, which rubs salt in the wounds of all the Mario Kart fans out there. There are, however, a bunch of deluxe and collector’s editions that I’ll just point you to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/">PS Blog</a> to read about.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was a major hit for PlayStation, adding to the growing stable of prestige AAA titles at the tail end of the last generation. Leading up to the game’s release there were concerns that its homage to samurai cinema would be too niche or that it would ape other open world games too closely. However, spurred on by the lockdown-induced gaming fever many of us fell victim to in the summer of 2020, Ghost of Tsushima would crush expectations to become on the PS4’s must-have exclusives. Having since launched on PS5 alongside the Iki Island DLC, and after debuting its superb multiplayer expansion, it’s become an all-time great for the console.</p>
<p>Looking back on out original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, Aran said, “Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>
