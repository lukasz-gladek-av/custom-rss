		<p>Over the years, Sony have had many beta programs for the various services and games but now they have decided to streamline the process and have one beta program for everything: games, system updates, even the PlayStation App.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to introduce the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative, ” said Sid Shurman on the<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/"> PlayStation Blog</a>. “It’s an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up to participate in future PlayStation betas across a wide range of PlayStation experiences. “</p>


<p>“The Beta Program at PlayStation will create an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas. A single registration for Beta Program at PlayStation will allow you to express interest in gaining beta access to test participating games for the PS5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on PlayStation.com. You only need to sign up once to express interest in these various betas, and if you receive an invitation to a specific beta, it’s up to you to decide whether you’d like to participate or not.”</p>
<p>There are a few requirements before you sign up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid account for PlayStation Network in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible for participation.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where Beta Program at PlayStation is available.</li>
<li>Players must meet the legal age requirement for their region.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get a pass for all of those you can head to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/&nbsp;</a>and sign up. Please note that the beta program may not be available in all countries.</p>
