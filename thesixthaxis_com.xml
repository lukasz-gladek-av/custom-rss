			<p>Isn’t it nice when a game comes out of nowhere and totally blows you away with its brilliance? GigaSword is one such game, a completely gorgeous nostalgia-soaked love-letter to the NES gaming era and metroidvanias.</p>
<p><iframe title="GIGASWORD | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oafJX_6jJ0w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Stylistically, GigaSword looks like a game that nine-year old me could have been blowing out dust from its cartridge before booting it up. However, there’s a lot more going on with GigaSword than can be seen in a static screen shot, with a multitude of modern video game sensibilities enhancing the experience significantly. Thanks to the hand-drawn visuals, there’s a palpable smoothness to the animation which most definitely was not a feature of my favourite NES games; heroic player character Ezra moving with effortless grace due to the sumptuous frame-by-frame animation.</p>


<p>Despite utilising only 25 colours, the expansive world – or tower, I suppose – that Ezra must explore in order to defeat big bid guy General Vearst and his cronies, is enormously varied, with some genuinely impressive vistas to stumble upon. The parallax backgrounds provide far more depth than a classic NES era game, depicting dust coated libraries, dingy dungeons, and dank sewers, but never losing that distinctive late 80’s/early 90’s aesthetic that remains so effortlessly endearing.</p>


<p>Thankfully, one thing GigaSword does loose from the NES era is the unrelenting difficulty, as my middle-aged reactions really aren’t what they used to be. Combat is satisfyingly simple and completely fair. Sure, some of the screen-filling bosses will test you, but thanks to a perfect difficulty curve and very generous check points – definitely not a feature of NES games! – your progress will not be hampered for long, resulting in an enjoyable and frustration free retro experience.</p>
<p>If it was just the combat and the exploration of a metroidvania that GigaSword offered, along with a slightly too slow release of new abilities, it would be decent but nothing special. However, the inclusion of an impressive range of puzzles elevates Jack Breen’s labour of digital love to the upper echelons of its genre. GigaSword, you see, is all about answering the question of what it would be like to actually wield an enormous sword. And, have no doubts, Ezra’s sword is so massive that it would make even Cloud Strife jealous.</p>

<p>Unlike the buster sword, though, Ezra’s weapon of choice is actually heavy. Whilst carrying it he isn’t as manoeuvrable and cannot jump, climb, and swim with as much grace-filled ease as he otherwise would. Cue some brilliant puzzles. The GigaSword is both vital but also an encumbrance, the player having to solve some deviously innovative brainteasers to get both Ezra and his sword through each section. We’re talking The Legend of Zelda levels of brilliance here, with each puzzle mechanic starting out seemingly basic, but then building and building until it hits the perfect amount of brain-tingling delight and satisfaction that only the best puzzle games can achieve. Each time I thought I’d seen every puzzle element that GigaSword had to offer, the game threw another superbly calibrated idea my way. Indeed, with a run-time getting on to twenty hours, there’s a whole lot of GigaSword here to enjoy.</p>
<p>The music is also brilliant, summoning the iconic sounds of NES era to the delight of my lugholes. GigaSword’s soundtrack was made in Famitracker using the Konami VRC6 sound chip, so it really delivers on the nostalgia. Alongside, to my great but welcome surprise, a genuinely emotive storyline and well-rounded characters, GigaSword proves that there really isn’t anything developer Jack Breen can do.</p>

			<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark is perhaps the cosiest video game I can think of. It’s like a digital snoodie. One of the one’s that’s so soft it envelopes you entirely in a cloud of comfort. But don’t let Lynked’s 3D cartoon styled visuals fool you, this game is no pushover, offering an addictive and compelling dungeon-crawler experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lynked: Banner of the Spark | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_6zU2ktIhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with an AI apocalypse, though the despicable robot that caused this global catastrophe is so adorable you’d be forgiven for just wanting to give them a hug. You take on the role of one of the last remaining humans, trapped within a brightly coloured and rather pleasant looking prison. You get to customise your character before you begin, with a rather beguiling amount of option to give your hero a unique look – hands off the big blue Gandalf beard though, that’s mine. Once you look suitably spiffing, the game begins proper with a prison break. You team up with a cute little robo called Buddy who guides you to freedom, and handily explains how to play the game on your way.</p>


<p>Combat is simple but satisfying. Played from a top-down perspective, your little fella takes it to their cutesy Pixar-ish foes – consisting of big cyclops-eyed mechs, teeny drones, and anthropomorphic androids – with the standard variety of combo attacks, dashes, and special abilities. You’ve fought these fights a thousand times or more, but there’s something comforting about the familiarity of the combat mechanics, which I’m pretty sure is what the developer FuzzyBot was going for. Sometimes the sense of contact when you strike feels a little off, rather too lightweight, and dashes aren’t always effective, but otherwise these are reliably enjoyable fisticuffs.</p>


<p>Being a roguelite, you head out to a dungeon, get as far as you can before dying, then start all over again, albeit with some permanent upgrades that make you slightly more powerful than you were before. It’s nice and satisfying to make incremental progress, but the real incentive to battle through that dungeon is to receive new building types for your town. That’s right, Lynked: Banner of the Spark is a building sim too, and it’s in this aspect that the game really delivers.</p>
<p>There’s a huge variety of buildings to decorate your homestead with, each having a meaningful impact on the gameplay experience, providing players with new abilities or tools to take back into the dungeon. Placing buildings and customising their look is simple and accessible and utterly wonderful, thanks to how freaking gorgeous everything looks when you get it set up just right. There’s a ton of activities to entertain yourself with too; from fishing, to gathering resources, farming, and socialising with the town’s charming inhabitants.</p>

<p>It’s all rather lovely, but there’s just one problem: a vital part of Lynked: Banner of the Spark is multiplayer. You can explore fellow player’s towns, assist them in their construction, take part in social activities, and obviously go get some loot from a nearby dungeon together. At least, that’s the idea. On PS5 I struggled to find a single other person to play with. Perhaps on other formats with a higher player count this would be less of an issue, but it did mean that my time with Lynked: Banner of the Spark was strictly single player. A real shame that there are no local multiplayer options either, as the game would seem an ideal fit for some enjoyable couch co-op shenanigans.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lynked: Banner of the Spark is a hot chocolate of a game. Sweet, sumptuous and oh, so cosy. It offers an intriguing and fresh experience thanks to combining roguelite dungeon crawling with town-building, and it keeps you engaged from beginning to end. It's just a shame that, on PS5 at least, it’s a resolutely single-player experience rather than the multiplayer one that it’s intended to be.	</p></div>
