		<p>Xbox has announced a new Developer_Direct stream will take place on Thursday 23rd January at 6PM GMT, giving an inside look at some of the biggest games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> in 2025</p>
<p>The Developer_Direct will focus on four games from across Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and one third party title that Microsoft has cosied up to. Three of these games are known with one additional secret…</p>


<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them, visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and to id Studios for a look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Lastly, they’ll visit a surprise studio to see a brand new game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is obviously the headline act, a prequel tale to the acclaimed 2016 Doom and Doom Eternal, which sees us head back in time to see where the Doom Slayer came from, waging a more medieval war on Hell.</p>
<p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, comes from the makers of We Happy Few, but is a very different style of game, a third person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South. Playing as Hazel, you’ll dive into a flooded world that takes deep inspiration from folklore to unravel a hidden past.</p>

<p>A Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a gorgeous looking turn-based RPG from French studio Sandfall interactive, seeing you lead a team on a last-ditch effort to foil the Paintress and stop her from wiping out yet another age group, turning them into dust. Who does she think she is? Thanos?</p>
<p>Microsoft has made a tradition out of hosting a developer showcase in January to start off the year, looking at games for the year ahead. January 2024 saw them reveal <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> gameplay, give a deep dive into the gameplay of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> (which was eventually postponed to February 2025), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</a>.</p>
