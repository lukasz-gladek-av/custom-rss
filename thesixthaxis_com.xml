		<p>Rockstar Games has released brand new mission content for Red Dead Online with this pack of content called Strange Tales of the West. Now, according to the trailer this is volume one of Strange Tales of the West. We get a small glimpse of what to expect in Red Dead Online’s new content and you can take a gander yourself right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pcg9NVGMxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer for Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West you will come up against zombies, alligators, a cult that worships a blood red sun, and robots that look a bit like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. Full details of each mission can be read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Tales of the Plague – There are stories of a malady spreading among the people of Armadillo, turning them into shambling undead. It’ll fall on you to retrieve several of these diseased corpses for scientific examination, if you can avoid infection and fend off attacks from a resurgent cell of nearby cultists.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of Modern Science – A nearby man of science claims he’s created artificial life that stalks the grounds of Braithwaite Manor, killing those curious or unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Bring the strange experiment to light by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Bayou – Something unholy lurks in the swamps of Lagras. Explore at your own risk, be wary of ambushes by Swamp Folk who call those wetlands home, and bring the swamp creature back for Theodore.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Wilderness – Investigate reports of a missing scientist last seen conducting strange research on a crew of murderers in Tall Trees. When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the Strange Tales of the West content in Red Dead Online you can visit any post office or your camp lockbox and picking up four telegrams from Theodore Levin. On completion of each mission you will get triple gold, RDO$, and experience points up until August 4th.</p>

<p>The release of this new content for Red Dead Online is a surprise as in 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/08/red-dead-online-support-cut-back-as-rockstar-focuses-on-gta6/">Red Dead Online support was cut back as Rockstar moved focus to GTA 6.&nbsp;</a>The sign that support is once again up and running for Red Dead Online would suggest there is a dedicated team working on Red Dead again, and it may even point to more Red Dead news in the future.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the development team behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, revealing that the game is coming from Nintendo EPD Tokyo, the same studio and team as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Further details on who the game director or lead designers are have not been confirmed at this time, but this is an indication of just how highly Nintendo regards this game to put it in the hands of such a revered team. That DK Bananza is coming out right around the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, just over six weeks after, also makes this game hugely important as a launch window exclusive.</p>


<p>Given how tight-lipped Nintendo usually is over their development teams, and who is working on what games, this will actually only increase speculation over when we might expect to see the next Mario-led 3D platformer. Since the release of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, the only other 3D Mario action that we’ve seen was the Bowser’s Fury expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">the Switch port of Super Mario 3D World in 2021</a>. At the time, this was seen by many as being a potential glimpse of the next era of Mario platformer… but that wait could be lengthened if the whole studio is working on DK Bananza, without the workforce having been split to foster multiple game concepts.</p>
<p>Still, this greatly increases the expectations that we all have for Donkey Kong Bananza. We said, of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, “[It] is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo play with new ideas while also paying homage to their long&nbsp;history. Cappy’s abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario’s own, and there’s a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting&nbsp;kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner.&nbsp;Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece.”</p>

<p>I’ve also been hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">an extended preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, saying “while some elements like just how chaotic and frenzied the screen can get while digging with complete abandon still feel a little unlike Nintendo, playing for longer reveals a lot more of what this team are trying to do and how the inventiveness that’s been a core part of this studio’s games for so long can really shine through.”</p>
