		<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock creator Ken Levine, has released a new short teaser for its upcoming FPS Judas. This little teaser shows different environments of The Mayflower, the colony ship that Judas, the main character, lives on. The Mayflower is an environment filled with decades of changes, which Judas has to navigate along with the different relationships which she finds difficult to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Judas Environment Themes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O-29-fOEE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new Judas dev log, the team said, <em>“We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots — a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it’s also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah — a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a “Judas Simulator.” Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.”</em></p>
<p>The Mayflower is split into different sections from VIP Pilgrim Quarters, Regular Pilgrim Dorms, and Violator Quarters with each having its own distinct style. These styles show the divides within a society where the citizens have devolved into a bitter battle of constantly spying on one another and dobbing one another in for even the slightest offences. It’s machines, not people who are in control of business, art, government, and they’re trying to turn the humans into robotic model citizens.</p>

<p>Judas does not have a release date yet, but it is expected for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>
