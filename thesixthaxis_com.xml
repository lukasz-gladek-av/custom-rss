		<p>Tougher bosses are starting to appear in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> from today, as new variant Nightlords known as the Everdark Sovereigns emerge in FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off to the hit Soulslike.</p>
<p>A new Everdark Sovereign will be added to Limveld each week, a time-limited challenge for players who have defeated the boss in their original form to test themselves against. The reward for defeating them will be Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics, with additional Sigils awarded for the first time you defeat a particular Sovereign.</p>


<p>The First Everdark Sovereign is an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night known as Gaping Jaw, and is now available to play. You have until June 26 9:59 JST / 1:59 BST / 2:59 CEST / 5:59 PM PDT to take him on.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will emerge, while others –&nbsp;Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog – will be added to the rotation at a later date.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Everdark Sovereigns are only available to battle if you’re playing in online mode.</p>

<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/the-switch-2s-first-post-launch-update-is-stronger-and-more-stable-er/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first post-launch update for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is here, bumping the version number up to 21.0.5, and you’ll never guess what it does…</p>
<p>Actually, you probably will guess, because this is a minor version bump, and Nintendo has broken out the tried and true single line patch note for Switch System Update 21.0.5. Here’s what it does:</p>


<ul>
<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user’s experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it.</p>
<p>It’s all behind the scenes stuff, in other words. Stability can mean all manner of things, and could include stamping out any minor crash bugs, solving GameChat’s activation glitches – something we sadly cannot test again – sorting the strange battery reporting issue, and improving edge case performance for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">backward compatible games</a> by updating the translation layer.</p>
<p>Similar to Microsoft’s cross-gen system software, Nintendo is keeping system updates in lockstep across the original Switch and Switch 2. So Switch System Update 21.0.5 is out now across the original model, Switch Lite, Switch OLED and Switch 2 all together.</p>

<p>While there’s some key system features for the Switch 2, including GameChat and GameShare, a bespoke new version of the Nintendo eShop, and a tweaked home screen design, the absolute core functionality and general layout has remained the same. The systems share Nintendo’s new digital licensing system of Virtual Game Cards, so it makes sense that they share the same core.</p>
<p>Anyway, more stable is nice. We like things to be strong and stable round these parts. Not weak and wobbly.</p>
