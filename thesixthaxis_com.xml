		<p>The officially licensed EXG Pro Astro Bot Cable Guy will soon be available for pre-order, and it looks like a must-have for fans of Sony’s super-cute mascot.&nbsp; Designed to hold controllers, including the PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X|S controllers, and pretty much any mobile phone, Astro Bot can sit on your desk and be, well,&nbsp; super cute.</p>
<p>It’s also rather reasonably priced, considering the detail on the model and will cost you £29.99 plus postage.&nbsp; You can read more and get ready to pre-order over at <a href="https://exgpro.com/products/playstation-astro-bot-cable-guys-controller-holder-and-phone-stand?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3caf0d721&amp;_ss=r">EGXPro</a>.</p>




<p>Astro Bot will be getting a fresh update in July with free content.</p>

<p>“5 brand new levels will make their way into the game as part of the Vicious Void Galaxy, bringing the total number of levels in Astro Bot to a whopping 90+! As with our last update, these 5 levels will require you to pull every bit of skill together to complete so hang on to your DualSense Controller and dive in!” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">commented</a> Nicolas Doucet, Studio Head at Team Asobi.</p>
<p>“The 5 levels available will be:Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation and… well. You’ll have to play and see. And who knows? Maybe completing all Vicious Void might lead to something really cool?”</p>
<p>The levels will come with new collectable Special Bots including one that is a “revengeful newcomer”. Also, an updated version of the Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense wireless controller is launching later this year with a new twist on the touch pad.</p>
<p>Astro Bot cleaned up at this years<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/astro-bot-wins-five-baftas-still-wakes-the-deep-claims-three/"> BAFTA awards</a> winning five of the seventeen awards that were available.&nbsp; We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review,</a></p>
<p>“Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is. Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>
