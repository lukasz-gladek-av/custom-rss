		<p>It seems the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> release date has leaked, the game set to launch on 15th May 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and naturally day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The leak has seemingly come from an article that was briefly posted online by Gamekult, spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">Resetera</a>, who may have been briefed ahead of time on the content of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">Xbox Developer_Direct stream that will take place tomorrow</a>, Thursday 23rd January.</p>


<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>
<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them ahead of expected launches in 2025, and alongside Doom: The Dark Ages, it will be visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and one final surprise studio and game reveal – there’s been lots of rumours for an Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake…</p>
