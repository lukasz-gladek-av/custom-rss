			<p>You have to love indie games. Ideas that probably wouldn’t raise the pulse of the shareholders at Ubisoft or Activision are given the chance to grow and develop, bringing surprises, joy and a range of emotions that their AAA brethren can only hope to emulate. Is This Seat Taken? is the perfect example of this, a cosy puzzler that’s fundamentally about helping people to enjoy where they’re sitting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? – Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQLzRj1E6Ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you arrive in each city, beginning in beautiful Bareclona, you’re given a series of stages where the characters have to be appeased. They’re generally going on a journey, so you have to work on the seating arrangements for the trip, dealing with people who can’t face backwards, have forgotten to wash that day, or desperately want to chat to the person next to them.</p>


<p>The problems arise when other people dislike smells, don’t want to talk, or just want to be on their own, forcing you to think long and hard about where they’re going to sit. As you progress, the demands get greater, the dislikes become more wide ranging, and more and more people want to get on the bus. You’ll find yourself shifting people all over the place, like a game of musical chairs for toddlers who may or may not sit in the nearest chair, for reasons known only to them.</p>


<p>It’s not just buses, but cars, cinemas, gigs, diners and various other places where sitting down is a key part of the experience. Fundamentally, the action, such as it is, is the same for each stage, but the changing setups help to keep things interesting, with different needs such as food and drink, friends, belongings and music coming to the fore based on the context.</p>
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a cosy little view into the human mind. Let’s face it, we’re all a fussy bag of desires and dislikes, and most of the time, we don’t share those with the people we’re put into close proximity with. There’s a key sense of discomfort when you place someone incorrectly, and their face makes sure you know it – I literally couldn’t bring myself to complete a level without achieving a 100% rating. That’s probably made stronger by years working in customer service, but it’s funny to find it so affecting when you’re placing a batch of cartoon shapes into a bus.</p>

<p>Is This Seat Taken? has a simple but lovely art style. Each person is represented by a different shape, and little details such as hats, shoes and earrings to personalise them. The notes you’re given on their needs are also chunky little handwritten lists, with a tickbox to show you’ve got each element right. It’s all enhanced by the chill musical ditties playing in the background, which sit just the right side of elevator music. They don’t distract, instead massaging your clever little brain as you take care of all these needy little shapes.</p>
<p>There’s a few mild foibles to Is This Seat Taken? which take you slightly out of the fiction, not least the food and drink areas where you can sit random people together who’ll dive into the same box of fries or share a cup of coffee. Once you’ve got over that slightly strange fact – made weirder by the notion that people are otherwise <em>so</em> demanding in the game – you can just settle into the calm and enjoyable puzzling. It’s overall not the toughest of games, but everything is so well done that you likely won’t notice.</p>

		<p>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert will not be released in late 2025, with a new release now expected in early 2026. The game was f<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/11/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-2021-open-world-fantasy/">irst revealed back in 2020</a> with an initial release year of 2021, before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/02/crimson-desert-delayed-new-release-date-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox/">getting delayed in August 2021</a>. The news came from an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>). It was less than a year ago when Pearl Abyss released the below trailer giving the late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the earnings call, Pearl Abyss said, <em>“Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market. The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>
<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</em></p>

<p>In our preview of Crimson Desert, Stefan said, <em>“We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year”</em></p>

		<p>The life immersion sim inZOI will be releasing on PS5 in 2026, Krafton has announced. The aim is to get the game out in the first half of 2026 and it could be the target is to launch it a year after early access launched on PC, which was in March this year. Krafton has confirmed the PS5 version will be optimised for consoles and it will have the same features as the PC version.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition to the PS5 announcement, Krafton also announced the free Island Getaway DLC, which will add the new location of Cahaya. Cahaya is a location that is based upon South East Asian locations, and it will add new activities such as snorkelling and swimming. There will be two islands to explore in Island Getaway, including a resort island and a main island. Motorcycles and electric scooters will allow players to travel around all locations in the game, and you will also be able to undertake new roles including farming, mining, fishing, and gem crafting. Random gatherings will also take place around the world of inZOI, and there will be new ways to co-operate with other players too. Krafton has also stated that this update will bring limited controller support, which will be in a testing phase.</p>
<p><em>“Cahaya was shaped by feedback from our players, going all the way back to Early Access launch earlier this year,”</em> said Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim, CEO of inZOI Studio and Director of&nbsp;inZOI.<em> “This DLC reflects a vision we’ve built together with our community. Developing a game in a new genre has been a real challenge, but the support we’ve received means everything to us, and we’re just getting started.”</em></p>

<p>The launch of the Island Getaway DLC will coincide with the Mac launch of inZOI on August 20th.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive and SEGA has released a new teaser for Football Manager 26, the next football manager game that will be released after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled earlier this year.</a> This new video gives us a glimpse at some in game footage of the Football Manager 26’s match day experience, including a tease of player walk outs. There is also a focus on the Premier League branding, which has been officially licensed for the new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | GUESS WHO'S BACK | #FM26" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faFwhGRwLCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This has been a very bumpy journey for Sports Interactive and its long running Football Manager series. The cancellation of Football Manager 25 was the first time a game in the series had ever been cancelled, and the main reason for this was the shift from the old engine to Unity to provide a more up to date gameplay experience. Football Manager 25 was meant to incorporate women’s football, but it was going to cut &nbsp;Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It is not yet clear if these modes will be in Football Manager 26.</p>
<p>While there is no release date for Football Manager 26 yet, it would be expected to follow previous games in the series and launch at some point in November, so players can play through the 2025/26 season and beyond. Sports Interactive has stated more information will be coming soon about what to expect in Football Manager 26.</p>
