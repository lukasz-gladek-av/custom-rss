		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> will launch on 25th March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Want to try it out sooner? Well, there’s a closed beta coming in February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Siren Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5hsuRpMiDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Killing Floor 3 closed beta will take place from 20th-24th February across all platforms, giving Tripwire a great chance to stress test the live launch. You need to sign up for access, which you can do on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor website</a>.</p>

<p>There’s multiple editions of the game, some region specific, in partnership with Plaion as their distributions partner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99) – Available in North America, includes the base game and a pre-order bonus, either the limited timed exclusive Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack<strong>, </strong>or the Flatline Tactical Bundle (at select retailers).</li>
<li><strong>Day 1 Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99) – Available outside North America, includes the base game, Flatline Tactical Bundle, and Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there’s two digital editions, in addition to a base game version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>(MSRP of $59.99) – Includes the Shadow Agent Specialist &amp; Weapon Skin Sets, Launch Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Creds.</li>
<li><strong>Elite Nightfall Edition </strong>(MSRP of $79.99) – Includes everything from the Deluxe Edition plus Year 1 Premium Nightfall Supply Pass Access (four passes) and 3000 Creds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves.</p>
<p>The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

		<p>Marking the 25th anniversary of series, EA has re-released the first two games and all their expansion in The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sims &amp; The Sims 2 Legacy Collections - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQUMkHngWjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Both are available now ahead of the franchise’s birthday on 4th February, on sale separately or combed in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle along with The Sims 4 Grunge Revival Kit and The Sims 4 Throwback Kit bundled in with each game respectively.</p>
<p>Both games have been tweaked and updated to help them work with modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines.</p>
<p>For The Sims it now supports aspect ratios other than 4:3 and will automatically set itself to your monitor’s aspect ratio on launch. There’s also crisper rendering – though you can cycle through different scaling options with Alt + Enter – and they’ve fixed a handful of crashes and bugs while they’re at it.</p>

<p>The Sims 2 seemingly needed more work to get working, with the following change list:</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphicsRules.sgr now supports modern hardware configurations</li>
<li>Fixed a shadow bug that surrounded Sims with a big black square</li>
<li>Wide screen and higher game resolutions are now supported</li>
<li>UI scales better to higher resolutions</li>
<li>Texture memory corruption and “pink soup” are fixed</li>
<li>Dragging The Sims 2 window from one monitor to another works more smoothly</li>
<li>If your computer has a lot of RAM, The Sims 2 is able to use it</li>
<li>Fixed several crashes</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, there’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iej4qa/sims_2_legacy_not_launching_for_me/">plenty of technical complaints with DirectX 9.0c errors</a> for some with The Sims 2 – seemingly high refresh rates and/or resolutions above 1080p don’t play too nice. It’s also quite a shame that, even though it would have taken more work to re-port them to new hardware, there’s no Mac versions for these releases.</p>
<p>Oh, and the IKEA pack is missing from The Sims 2, much to the dismay of quirkily named flat pack furniture fans around the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warner Bros. is holding up the cartoon white flag and saying “That’s all Folks!” to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, with support for the character-filled brawler coming to an end after Season 5 on 30th May 2025. On that date, the game will be removed from online stores and servers will be shut down, but it will still be playable offline.</p>
<p>All online features will run up until 30th May at 9AM PST (5PM UK time), after which point the game will be playable offline only, with solo AI battles or couch multiplayer with up to four players.</p>


<p>In order to keep the game accessible, you must play and log in at some time during Season 5 – from 4th February to 30th May – which will create the necessary save file and online account links to allow you to play offline with all earned and purchased content.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the game’s shutdown, real money purchases have been taken down from today. You can no longer purchase Gleamium, though it and character tokens can be used through to the server shutdown.</p>

<p>The MultiVersus team at Player First Games wrote a little thank you at the end of the announcement:</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey.​</p>
<p>&nbsp;​We hope that you all enjoy the final Season of MultiVersus.</p>
<p>MultiVersus burst onto the scene in 2022, offering a Super Smash Bros. contender filled with characters drawn from across the Warner Bros. media empire. However, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">after an initial surge of popularity for the open beta</a>, the rapidly growing community started to highlight gameplay deficiencies and developer Player First Games struggled to keep up, while also producing all the regular content that a free-to-play live service needs.</p>
<p>So the game was pulled from storefronts, instead of trying to roll through to a full release, and only reappeared last year.&nbsp;While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. admitted in financial reports that MultiVersus’ revival had underperformed expectations, so alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">the end of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping Player First Games get the opportunity to craft something new and fun.</p>
