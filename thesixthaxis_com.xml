		<p>Happy Friday! It is the end of a week of annual leave for me though, so it is a deflated Friday for me. I have been on my hollibobs with my Switch, and while I had set out to play a bunch of things, the only thing I played was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for hours, and hours and hours. You can have my full review of it next week!</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, is at that Gamescom, playing all sorts of things, including the awesome-looking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">No Ghosts at the Grand</a>. He will have loads of things to tell you about in the next few weeks as well, so definitely look out for that.</p>

<p>Aran has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/tiny-bookshop-review/">Tiny Bookshop</a> for review, saying,&nbsp; “It is such a chilled out game. It may be my game of the year!” Strong words for the end of August!</p>
<p>Gamoc has been playing Echoes of the End for review, which he loves, as well as a bit of Death Stranding and Smash Bros.</p>

<p>Jim is still chipping away at Far Cry 5 and although some of the open-world activities are starting to repeat themselves, there are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh. He says, “I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>

<p>Ade polished off his reviews for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. He also played through the side-scrolling cheerleader beat ’em up Ra Ra Boom with Laura for her review. He’s been packing the gaming in this week though, continuing, “I’ve also tried the new Rogue Prince of Persia on PlayStation Plus – which is excellent – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters. Though most of my gaming time has been spent playing Marvel Rivals! I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third.”</p>
<p>Laura has been playing Ra Ra Boom, telling us, “The title of which must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos) with @Ade. We love a good side-scrolling beat em up and Ra Ra Boom (sing it!) has such a gorgeous art style!”</p>

<p>Steve has been deeply immersed in three completely different postapocalyptic settings (four if you count the state of the real world) but two of those are super secret so he’s just been playing, “The continuing adventures of Wuchang super sexy bird girl which is still following the pattern of being really enjoyable until I spend hours bashing my head against a brick wall boss.”</p>
<p>Finally, Miguel has been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a few rounds in the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8!</p>
<p>So then, have you been playing anything this week?</p>
