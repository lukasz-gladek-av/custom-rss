<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion update December 18th patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We’ve fixed an issue which would prevent the “Special Attack Assemble” achievement from triggering in online modes<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve given Wolverine and She-Hulk a pep talk – fixing their grab attack and stopping them from freezing mid action.<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed Annihilus moving out of view if his armor is broken by She-Hulk’s Spinning throw<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also stopped Annihilus from become intangible if his armor is broken by Wolverine’s grab and slash attack<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed missing subtitles for Spider-Man’s first post-Annihilus battle dialogue<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed a blocker that meant the last player couldn’t pick an already-selected Super Hero in Arcade Mode (even if the Doppleganger modifier was turned on)<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed an issue where move lists were displaying incorrectly in multiplayer, if Player One was using a keyboard<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also had a chat with Hela to ensure she doesn’t get bored and go idle if host players leave a multiplayer game during the fight<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also fixed achievement-related freezes on Windows and Xbox, as well as various crash issues on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2<wbr></li>
</ul>

<li>We’ve fixed the life bar showing incorrect costumes when changing characters<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve made sure that feedback is shown correctly when Super Heroes run out of ammo<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also fixed an issue where over-time damage numbers from Phyla-Vell’s cosmic damage was not displaying correctly in multiplayer<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed character select inconsistencies which could cause Super Hero icons to be incorrectly greyed out</li>
</ul>
