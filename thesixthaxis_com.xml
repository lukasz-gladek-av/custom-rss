		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a> is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 17th December, launching on the same day as a new Fuddler’s Courtship DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ESRB] Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley – Fuddler’s Courtship &amp; Consoles | Coming 17th of Dec!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twB2woK3HKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley launched earlier this year, a wonderful adaptation of Tove Jansson’s enduring world and characters. Instead of following the Moomins themselves, it casts you instead as the carefree wanderer Snufkin, returning&nbsp;to Moominvalley in the spring, just as the Moomins are waking up from their winter hibernation, only to find that things have changed and that her best friend, Moomintroll, has gone missing. What was once an idyllic natural area, has been cut down in places, drained out, and transformed into more orderly parks. We can’t be having that, now, can we?</p>
<p>Whether you’re coming to the game new on PS5 and Xbox, or returning to it on Switch and PC,&nbsp;Fuddler’s Courtship will add a new pocket-sized adventure to the game, shifting the season to the autumn, and with the colour palette changing to match. This is a story of romance, as Fuddler needs some help from Snufkin and Moomintroll, diverting from their planned pre-winter camping trip with a chaotically romantic new journey.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a charming game and adaptation. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review/">our review</a>, Aran said, “Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is a delightful game, which will please long time Moomin fans, and could introduce the characters to a new audience and generation. The game is wholesome, one for all ages, and addresses the issue of environmentalism in a careful and constructive way. It is definitely worth playing.”</p>
