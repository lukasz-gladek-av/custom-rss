<p>Atomfall’s Wicked Isle story takes place on Midsummer Island, which is close to the site of Windscale Atom Plant. As a result those who reside on the island and the environment have been subject to higher infection levels compared to those in Wyndham Village and the surrounding areas. The new content adds new enemies including pirates and druids, as well as more weapons to add to your arsenal including the Blunderbuss shotgun. New skills will also be available for your character to use. Wicked Isle is not a standalone story, but weaves into the main story beats of the main game. So much so, that new endings have been added to take into account the events that take place on Midsummer Island.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomfall review, Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>
