		<p>Sony has confirmed the line up for the February 2026 PS Plus monthly games, with subscribers getting four games as part of the subscription. These games will be available from February 3rd and there is a decent mix of titles on offer. The games are Undisputed, Subnautica Below Zero, Ultros, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Undisputed Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4g44lARkFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Undisputed is going to be available for PS5. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed review</a>, I said, “Undisputed is a valiant attempt by Steel City Interactive, bringing back boxing to the fore in video games after a long absence. The in-ring action is generally very good and the roster is well stacked. What is missing is good commentary and there are gameplay issues that need to be addressed, including lag and stuttering. Undisputed is not ready to be a title challenger yet, but updates may see it get there eventually.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Subnautica: Below Zero Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdix1XxaZyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Subnautica is going to be available for both PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/11/subnautica-below-zero-review/">Subnautica: Below Zero review</a>, Jason said, “Subnautica: Below Zero is a masterfully horrific experience that encourages you to push on despite your fears. It’s a fine balancing act of the horrors you’ll face underwater and the rewards you can get for evading them. It’s really very hard, but it’s also really very good.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ultros – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iloiRk1k3_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ultros will be available for PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros review</a>, Steve said, “Ultros is a true labour of love that has a lot to say about the balance between violence and peace, and exploitation and environmentalism, themes which are incredibly important and too often ignored in games, but this theme sometimes feels at odds with the basic game mechanics and can lead to early frustration. The game is quite clear that the first ending is a bad one due to the violence required to reach it, but I couldn’t justify the investment of time and energy to continue past this to complete the more acceptable approach. In a way, this feels appropriate to me as it demonstrates why true change is so difficult to achieve in wider environmental terms. I guess the gap between the message and the mechanics here is not as wide as I initially thought.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown - PS4/XB1/PC - Open Fire (Launch Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnU9v1IE1nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 will be available for PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown review</a>, Dom said, “In Ace Combat 7 dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>
