		<p>It is reported that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/"> Baldur’s Gate</a> will be coming to television screens, with the show following on from the end of the third game.&nbsp; <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a> reports that HBO have secured the rights to make the show and also the talents of Craig Mazin, co-creator of The Last of Us television series and the fantastic Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Mazin is a big gamer and has completed Baldur’s Gate 3 on Honor mode, a single-save difficulty setting featuring smarter enemies, higher enemy health, and punishing ‘Legendary Actions’ for bosses. It is reported that the series will include existing and new characters, and Mazin will be reaching out to the voice actors from the game to try to get them into the television series.</p>


<p>“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said. “I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate&nbsp;and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.”</p>
<p>Mazin is also a long-time fan of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and has been running games as a Dungeon Master for fifteen years.&nbsp; HBO have <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">strongly hinted</a> that the third season of The Last of Us will be the final season, so it would be logical that Baldur’s Gate would be Mazin’s next project.</p>
<p>In an interesting twist, the Baldur’s Gate series will “co-exist” alongside another Dungeons and Dragons show that is coming to Netflix, The Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Craig Mazin on&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate,” Francesca Orsi, EVP, Head of HBO Drama Programming said. “His deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters, promises ground-breaking results.”</p>
