		<p>It definitely feels like spring has sprung… again this week. It’s been nice and sunny to cut through some of the chill, there’s been a little bit of mizzle, and now the clocks are going to jump forward this week, much to the delight of cats and dogs around the country that are going to get fed an hour early tomorrow (or more realistically, on Monday).</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>A surprise Nintendo Direct brought some announcements for the original Switch, while we all wait for next week’s big Nintendo Switch 2 stream, but there were also some significant shifts and announcements from around the rest of the industry.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s</strong> is jumping into Atomfall this weekend, but while twiddling thumbs through the last few days before its release, he played a ton of&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and sees many more hours ahead with the game – he upgraded it to Afterbirth as well – and played a bit of The Tainted Grail : Fall of Avalon demo, which he says it “a promising Skyrim-alike old-school RPG with some janky combat but great atmosphere.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead, even if it’s only 47 hours long!</p>
