		<p>There’s a few of the TSA team that have jetted off to Japan in the first few months of the year, but for most of us it remains a pipe dream. But we’re blessed with countless games that look to recreate the country, whether it’s the seedy underbelly of Tokyo in the Yakuza games or patches of the country’s past. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest, and it’s absolutely been worth the wait. Are you leaping into its hay bale of stabby delights this weekend?</p>

<h2>Games in Review &amp; Featured Articles</h2>
<p>We’re at the top and the tail of the alphabet this week, but whether it’s assassins, alchemy or xenos, we’re dropping 9’s left right and centre!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/"><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></a> – <strong>PS5</strong>, XSX|S, PC – 9/10</li>

</ul>
<p>Not only that, but we also love the handheld and headphones we’ve been using of late:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/"><strong>Retroid Pocket 5</strong></a> – 9/10</li>

</ul>
<p>I have a feeling that next week’s going to be a bit of a comedown from that, but we also enjoyed the other games we played this week. We’ve got an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/atomfall-review/"><strong>Atomfall</strong></a> review in progress from Gamoc, which is thoroughly endearing, if imperfect so far.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I dipped into a pair of early access games with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2</a></strong> showing how this crash-happy sequel is looking to step things up over the hit original, and the action roguelike raiding of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/"><strong>33 Immortals</strong></a> has well and truly got me hooked. I’m literally going to go and play it right after finishing this round-up!</p>
<p>Finishing up for the week, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/what-we-played-assassins-creed-shadows-xenoblade-chronicles-x-atelier-yumia/"><strong>What We Played</strong></a> featured Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Xenoblade Chronicles X &amp; Atelier Yumia.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s</strong> wait for Atomfall was broken by grabbing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, the Smash TV clone Deathrun TV, and the platforming puzzler The Last Shot. That should keep him busy this weekend, until Atomfall arrives next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>
