		<p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil Showcase for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming this week, airing on Thursday 15th January at 10PM GMT. For those of you outside the meanest of timezones, that’s 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 11PM CET, 7AM JST (16th Jan).</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase tamely promises “<span dir="auto">brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem”, which definitely sounds plausible to me, but what new details are there to know? And how delicately will Capcom have to avoid getting too spoilery?</span></p>
<p>We already know a decent amount about the game. This ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft who is sent out into the field to investigate murders at a spooky hotel… which also happens to be where her mum was murdered.</p>
<p>Back at the game’s announcement, Capcom talked up having a new character who wasn’t so well versed in handling the horrors unleashed into the world. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/">As Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>But then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">they’ve made Leon a playable character anyway</a>! What this means practically is that Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, and Leon gets to do all the fun gun-slinging action stuff.</p>
<p>There’s also rumours of another returning character as well, and Capcom do have a tendency to throw in a random multiplayer game mode with their Resi games. I guess we’ll see if those appear in this showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.</p>

		<p>Whatever you might think of Disney’s handling of George Lucas’ sci-fi universe, it’s clear that we still can’t get enough of Star Wars. From the premiere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> at 2025’s The Game Awards, to the appearance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-10-to-6/">a little earlier on this list</a>, the future of a galaxy, far, far, away, seems assured, and certainly so with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> making it to number four on our list of 2026’s most wanted games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can stick your Cal Kestis lightsaber swinging, and your Sebulba-bashing pod-racing, Zero Company is Star Wars by way of XCOM. By that virtue, this is a tactical, strategic series of skirmishes through the darker, more serious side of Star Wars, with a turn-based combat style that will feel familiar to fans of games like XCOM, Baldur’s Gate 3 or Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>


<p>Coming from Bit Reactor, with support from Respawn and Lucasfilm Games, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi padawan. Your team is led by Hawks, a former Republic officer, who pulls the Zero Company together to complete a series of shadowy missions that look to have huge implications for the Star Wars universe. Quite how that plays out in terms of fitting into the wider canon, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p>


<p>The team at Bit Reactor have said that they want decisions to feel important, but that might be more to do with the customisation options for your characters and tactical choices on the battlefield, rather than overly impactful narrative moments. Either way, it’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the wider Star Wars universe from a new perspective, and there’s a huge range of possibilities with this period. Maybe you’ll complete a mission alongside Rex? Or come up against Maul as he works his way towards his takeover of Mandalore?</p>
<p>Bit Reactor definitely have the chops to pull this one off, not least because they’re a team made up of former XCOM alumni. XCOM, and its sequel, remain the benchmark for tactical strategy, so that bodes extremely well for Star Wars Zero Company’s gameplay, and with the XCOM license seemingly encased in Carbonite somewhere within 2K’s IP dungeons, this could well be the spiritual successor that fans have been waiting for, dressed up in one of sci-fi’s best and most beloved universes.</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is coming to PS5, PC and Xbox Series consoles in 2026.</p>
