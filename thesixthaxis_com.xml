		<p>The AI apocalypse is upon us. Again. But that’s OK, because it’s giveaway time this weekend! With the beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra Boom</a> set to launch on 12th August, Gylee Games has kindly shared ten codes for PlayStation with us to dish out to a handful of lucky winners, so you can go and fight back against our would-be robot oppressors!</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKOXf0Ye5Ig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the planet ruined by a rogue AI, there’s just one sanctuary for humanity left, and we’ve spent our time preparing… by training four carefully selected cheerleaders to become ninjas and shoot, smash and through the resurgent AI enemies.</p>
<p>Let’s hand over to our<strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/"> Ra Ra Boom preview</a></strong> from last month to meet our brawling foursome: “This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.”</p>
<p>The game is launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th August, and we’ve got ten copies of Ra Ra Boom to giveaway for PlayStation (UK/EU region)</p>
