<p>In a statement, Nightdive Studios said, <em>“We have encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles including Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation on June 26. We’re currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible. Because of this we’ve made the difficult decision to proceed with the game’s release on PC platforms (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble) on June 26, with the console release now targeting the first two weeks of July. We’ll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles.”</em></p>
