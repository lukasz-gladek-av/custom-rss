		<p>While there’s another two days of Gamescom 2025 over this weekend for the general public, for press, the show always comes to an end on Friday… just in time for me to name drop a few games for What We Played!</p>
<p>But what can I actually tell you about right now? There’s quite a few things embargoed until next week, but in the here and now, I’ve been able to share previews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Onimusha</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4</a>, I played a smidgeon of Kirby Air Ride and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, a little Directive 8020, and on and on and on. The next job is to write as much of this up as quickly as possible, so stay tuned over the next few days and weeks!</p>

<p>Having a far more sedate gaming experience, <strong>Aran</strong> reviewed Tiny Bookshop, and said that the exceptionally chilled out book-selling game “may be my game of the year.” High praise!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Echoes of the End, for review, as well as a bit of&nbsp;Death Stranding and Smash Bros., while Jim has continued on with Far Cry 5, though is starting to feel some of the grind setting in with the open world activities. “There are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh, and I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>


<p><strong>Laura’s</strong> been playing Ra Ra BOOM for our review, and demands that the game’s name “must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos”. She’s been joined by fellow side-scrolling beat ’em up lover Ade, and is loving the game’s art style.</p>
<p>But you can’t keep <strong>Ade</strong> away from other side-scrolling and/or licensed 1980s pop culture! There’s a Shinobi review in the pipe for next week, and he shared his thoughts on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown. Then there was some Rogue Prince of Persia – “which is excellent” – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters, though truth be told, he’s actually mainly played Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>He said, “I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third. Anyone else playing it?”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been enjoying a trio of post-apocalyptic settings, and while he can’t talk about two of them right now, he can say that he’s actually continued to enjoy Wuchang: Fallen Feathers…. until he spends hours butting up against a brick wall of a boss.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a lashing of the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8 for his smorgasbord of gaming.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> been on holiday, but has been taking a break from taking a break by playing a bit more of Story of Seasons.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is pretty darned slick. Gearbox had promised a grand overhaul of the game’s movement systems, a rejig of how weapons and customisation all works, and obviously a whole new planet to rampage across as a Vault Hunter, and I could definitely feel a lot of that when jumping into the game at Gamescom.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Harlowe" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really the enhanced movement that stood out for me. Gearbox has thrown everything into this – baby, bathwater and the kitchen sink – to give perhaps the broadest movement options found in a first person shooter. With a dash, a double jump, a glide, a grappling hook, and even all the Vault Hunters having learnt to swim, the only thing that’s really left for Borderlands 5 is straight up teleporting everywhere!</p>


<p>Beyond just letting you explore the bigger, broader open areas that Gearbox have promised for the game world, the enhanced movement will really allow for more front-foot combat styles, helping close gaps quickly to unload that spicy shotgun you have, while grapple points can be a great way get to elevated positions as a sniper to unload. Though, of course, there’s nothing that’s going to stop you just keeping your distance and blasting away, as you would have done in previous games.</p>
<p>Speaking of weapons, there’s now a myriad of new possibilities — and that’s saying something, considering how broad, sprawling and crazy the options were before. There’s a handful of new weapon manufacturers that define their particular styles, so Order weapons are charge and release, while Daedalus guns can use multiple ammo types. But there’s much more control over them thanks to now being able to combine mods and properties, blending the series’ distinctive weapon tweaks to let you create something that little bit more special.</p>


<p>A Jakobs pistol, for example, has critical hits that will see the bullets ricochet to nearby enemies, but why not add a Tediore accessory that gives your gun legs, so you can thrown it on the ground and have it keep blasting your enemies? Or a Maliwan SMG that has radiation and cryo elements to switch between, but with a Tediore accessory that has you throw on reload, homing in on enemies and exploding into four further grenades? Things can get pretty wild…</p>
<p>Another great twist is being able to replace the typical grenade or ordinance slot with another weapon, giving you a heavy weapon outlet that’s surprisingly just on a cooldown. You won’t have many bullets each time, but when you can reliably trigger another significant damage dealer, it liberates you from the pain of running out of ammo for your best guns.</p>

<p>We got to play with Harlowe for the first time, trying out the new Gravatar class with some high tech options for her Ability. We stuck with the CHROMA Accelerator for her Action Skill, firing off slow-moving energy pocket orbs that deal Cryo damage and can explode on command to deal further damage. Her alternate Actions put enemies in Stasis, again with a damaging effect, or place a Flux Generator that projects a damaging field to enemies while granting allies Overshield.</p>
<p>Battling through the Vault of Inceptus for this demo took us down to a series of floating rock islands in the foggy aether, battling against Seneschal robots and soldier types; animalistic Pinheads which charged at us; and tougher, named enemies to boot. We battled through each area to power up the bounce pad to the next area, ultimately flying through the sky to a hollowed out arena to face the Primordial Guardian Inceptus — a big, broad metallic-looking creature with two stinging tails and shifting attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Initially it bounds around this space, leaping in to attack with a sweep of its tails, before jumping up to the roof and spawning poisonous pustules adding hazards to the ground for you to avoid. That’s nothing compared to when it’s folded up in a cocoon of leaves, spreading a poisonous gas on the floor that forces you to adapt and stay up in the air.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly challenging boss battle, and really the main shame is that I don’t feel like I made the most of all of the gameplay possibilities that the game presents me. Much like min-maxing your builds in a Diablo game, you can often just go in blasting and have a nice time, but dropping into the middle of the game and with completely new loadouts to use, I didn’t quite grasp the best way to use Harlowe’s Action Skill — tricky when trying to target a fast-moving boss— and I failed to notice the grapple points in the final boss arena, which would have really helped me to stay up and away from the poisoned gas clouds. I was trying instead to jump and glide to stay off the ground, which was not entirely successful…</p>
<p>But, what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.</p>

		<p>Happy Friday! It is the end of a week of annual leave for me though, so it is a deflated Friday for me. I have been on my hollibobs with my Switch, and while I had set out to play a bunch of things, the only thing I played was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for hours, and hours and hours. You can have my full review of it next week!</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, is at that Gamescom, playing all sorts of things, including the awesome-looking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">No Ghosts at the Grand</a>. He will have loads of things to tell you about in the next few weeks as well, so definitely look out for that.</p>

<p>Aran has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/tiny-bookshop-review/">Tiny Bookshop</a> for review, saying,&nbsp; “It is such a chilled out game. It may be my game of the year!” Strong words for the end of August!</p>
<p>Gamoc has been playing Echoes of the End for review, which he loves, as well as a bit of Death Stranding and Smash Bros.</p>

<p>Jim is still chipping away at Far Cry 5 and although some of the open-world activities are starting to repeat themselves, there are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh. He says, “I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>

<p>Ade polished off his reviews for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. He also played through the side-scrolling cheerleader beat ’em up Ra Ra Boom with Laura for her review. He’s been packing the gaming in this week though, continuing, “I’ve also tried the new Rogue Prince of Persia on PlayStation Plus – which is excellent – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters. Though most of my gaming time has been spent playing Marvel Rivals! I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third.”</p>
<p>Laura has been playing Ra Ra Boom, telling us, “The title of which must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos) with @Ade. We love a good side-scrolling beat em up and Ra Ra Boom (sing it!) has such a gorgeous art style!”</p>

<p>Steve has been deeply immersed in three completely different postapocalyptic settings (four if you count the state of the real world) but two of those are super secret so he’s just been playing, “The continuing adventures of Wuchang super sexy bird girl which is still following the pattern of being really enjoyable until I spend hours bashing my head against a brick wall boss.”</p>
<p>Finally, Miguel has been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a few rounds in the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8!</p>
<p>So then, have you been playing anything this week?</p>
