		<p>OwlCat Games has released the main theme song for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, with the theme being composed by Paweł Perepelic. It has quite the epic sound to it and does capture some of that The Expanse feeling, delving into something that seems hopeful and inspiring but ending slightly on a mournful note. Have a listen for yourselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn — Main Theme" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PqNeoff3NI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn:</p>
<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>

<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition ($59.99) – </strong>All standard edition items plus name in credits, Miller’s OPA Heavy armour, and UN Spec Ops assault rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Pack ($79.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All standard and deluxe items plus digital Artbook, digital soundtrack, Hall of Fame, Miller’s Casual outfit, Miller’s revolver, exclusive beta access.</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</p>
