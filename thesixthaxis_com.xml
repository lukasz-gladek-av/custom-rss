		<p>HBO has released a new teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2, confirming that the show will return in April. Where season one of The Last of Us covered the events of the first game, season two will be delving into the story of the second game, introducing characters like Abby who will have a big part alongside Joel and Ellie.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Season 2’s trailer gives us a lot of brief shots, showing scenes from The Last of Us Part II captured by the show, with a mix of action and terror as the danger increases for everyone. Neil Druckmann has stated that Season 2 will not cover all of The Last of Us Part II. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a>. When asked if The Last of Us season 2 would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-teaser-trailer-reveals-some-new-story-beats/">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser trailer</a> there was more focus on the story, with one major change being Joel talking to what appears to be a therapist about his experiences. This may help people remember some story beats from the previous season, along with providing additional background to the events that occur in Season 2 without having to dive deeply into all of them.</p>
