		<p>Developer Skeleton Crew and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that the martial arts brawler Forestrike will be released on November 17th for PC and Switch. In addition, the demo for Forestrike has been updated with a third martial arts school, new schools, and new ways to learn techniques. A new trailer has been released too.</p>

<p>In Forestrike, you play as martial arts apprentice Yu who has the ability of Foresight which lets him see into the future to anticipate the attacks that will be coming his way. The game is a brawler and puzzler as you work out the best way to plan around what is coming to get out unscathed as Yu can only take a couple of hits before going down.</p>

<p>In our preview of Forestrike, Stefan said, <em>“For now, the demo provides a tasty morsel of the action that Forestrike will offer when it launches later this year. Unpicking the combat puzzles is sure to prove delectable to a particular cachet of players, ramping up to those ‘real’ battles where you have only one shot to pull off what you’ve been practicing, and leading to some gloriously slick combat sequences that would fit right into a martial arts movie.”</em></p>
