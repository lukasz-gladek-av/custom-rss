		<p>Ubisoft has announced the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes expansion, with this new content looking like it will be bringing in the Mangkwan Clan, also known as the Ash People. This clan is going to be focal point of the next Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash. In terms of release date, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes will be launching on December 19th, a few days after Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash hits cinemas.</p>

<p>This won’t be the only content coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in December either. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">A third person patch</a> was confirmed earlier this year, with a release date pencilled in for December 5th. The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person. In addition, Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. Now we know there will be some new enemies to take on.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, <em>“Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</em></p>
