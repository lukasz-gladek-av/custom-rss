		<p>Blades of Fire has been revealed by 505 Games and developer MercurySteam, their upcoming third person action RPG that will be launching surprisingly soon for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 22nd May 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Official Announcement Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFDarIpwXsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of smithing to be expected as you forge new weaponry to go up against a menagerie of enemies that include everything from imposingly armoured warriors, to many-handed freaks, and the more natural and mechanical.</p>
<p>There’s shades of the modern God of War to this, from the closeness of the third person camera, and it will be interesting to see how this has come together.</p>

<p>Spanish developer MercurySteam is best known in recent times for their excellent Metroid Dread, the culmination of over a decade working on a string of Castlevania games for Konami in the early 2010s, before being entrusted with a Metroid II: Samus Returns remake for 3DS.</p>
<p>Sure, Blades of Fire is going to be in a rather different genre, but looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread review</a>, I bestowed the 2D platforming sequel a fantastic 9/10, concluding:</p>
<p>“Metroid Dread sees the galaxy’s best bounty hunter return in fine form. It takes the terror of being hunted from Metroid Fusion, the more modern direction of Samus Returns, and the freedom to add to the series’ decades of lore to create something that’s nigh on essential for Metroid fans.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/psvr-2-gets-a-big-permanent-price-cut/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced a big price cut for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a>, dropping the recommended retail price of the of the VR headset starting in March.</p>
<p>The same two SKUs for PSVR 2 will still be on offer – a base edition that includes the PSVR 2 headset, PSVR 2 Sense controllers and some earbuds, and a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle that adds a digital download code for the game – and they will now have the exact same price.</p>


<p>The new RRP for PSVR will be $399.99 (pre-tax) / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty significant drop of $150 / €150 / £130 for the standard set, and $200 / €200 / £170 for the game bundle – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/psvr-2-price-cut-by-a-whopping-200-180-for-a-limited-time/">this matches the promotions from last summer</a>, as they were gearing up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the release of the PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps indicative of where PSVR 2 is as a product. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch have all gone without any price cuts since the start of this generation. In fact, they’ve actually become more expensive over time, even when shrunken down, simplified versions of these consoles have launched,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/"> like with the PS5 Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the PSVR 2 PC adapter last year, dropping the price permanently could spur on some sales, with speculation and insider whispers that Sony has struggled to shift the hardware – there’s also been rumours that Apple might like to co-opt the Sense controllers for Apple Vision Pro compatibility, though these are not sold separately and any plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Sony has noted that recent updates for PSVR 2 have added low-latency hand tracking, which lets you put the controllers down and play using your hands and fingers, the PSVR 2 headset mapping out their positions using the tracking cameras ordinarily used for following the Sense controllers. This is supported with the recently updated Waltz of the Wizard:</p>
<p><iframe title="Waltz of the Wizard - Hand Tracking Update Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXtR7_4IdaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All in all, this could make PSVR 2 a shade more appealing – it not longer quite costs more than a PS5 (with disc drive), for example – and the PC VR support is excellent, opening up broader access to VR gaming and with the reassuring longevity that PC gaming provides.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/metro-developer-4a-games-ukraine-rebrands-as-reburn-why-how-and-does-4a-games-still-exist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Independent developer 4A Games Ukraine has rebranded as Reburn and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/la-quimera-is-a-new-sci-fi-shooter-from-the-metro-devs-and-nicolas-winding-refn/">announced their new sci-fi IP La Quimera</a>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they’ve done this, and how, when 4A Games and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro">Metro</a> series are both owned by Embracer Group. Well, it’s because what has generally been referred to as 4A Games is actually two companies: 4A Games Malta which is owned by Embracer, and 4A Games Ukraine (now Reburn), which is independent.</p>


<p>It makes absolute sense that, now that they are launching a new IP, Reburn needs to stake out a new identity for itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for confusion here, and there is still some fuzzy grey areas in the understanding of the timelines and the financial transactions that took place over the past decade. We’ll seek to clear this up through this article.</p>

<p>In essence, 4A Games was founded in 2006 by a core group of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> developers striking out from GSC Game Worlds. In 2014, with the first wave of the Russian-backed uprisings in Eastern Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, some of the team, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/4a-games-opens-new-malta-studio">including creative director and co-founder Andrew Prokhorov and CTO Oles Shyshkovtsov</a>, left the country and set up a new studio in Malta – 4A Games Malta. Both studios could use the 4A Games trademark, share the 4A Engine, and develop <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> together. In public statements, the Malta studio was referred to as the headquarters for 4A Games, with the Kyiv studio</p>
<p>Where things get muddled is in August 2020. At that time, Embracer (who already held the Metro IP via Koch Media) acquired “4A Games”, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games/">announcing in the press release</a> that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> would be the new parent company for the 150+ members “across two studios in Malta and Ukraine”. Despite the last two years of instability for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a>, “4A Games” and the Metro IP are still held by the company.</p>
<p>However, the timeline according to Reburn is that Embracer only acquired 4A Games Malta in 2020. Separately in the same year, 4A Games Ukraine received additional investment and started work on their new IP La Quimera. At a later date, and to prevent future confusion, they have decided to leave the 4A Games trademark with the Malta-based studio and rebrand as Reburn.</p>
<p>It’s a quietly remarkable story for how unremarkable it actually is, outside of scratching our heads how Embracer didn’t actually acquire the Ukraine studio. There’s no big wave of layoffs, no exodus of developers, and both studios can proudly share their legacy of working on the Metro series. This is perhaps conceptually similar to how Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin created <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/10/08/dishonored-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Dishonored</a> together and then started working on separate projects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, both Reburn and 4A Games will be able to use the 4A Engine. While Reburn has now announced La Quimera, 4A Malta’s next game is still under wraps – the most recent game in the Metro series was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro: Awakening VR</a>, developed and self-published by Vertigo Games, and we know that a new Metro is in the works.</p>
