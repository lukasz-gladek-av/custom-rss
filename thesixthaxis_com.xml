		<p>Michael Sarnoski, best known for directing A Quiet Place: Day One has signed up for the Death Stranding movie at A24 Productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/">Deadline</a> report he will both write and direct the film which “will delve into the game’s mysteries surrounding the ‘Death Stranding’ — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.”</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoilers for Death Stranding now follow!</strong></em></p>
<p>Reports suggest that this means the film will be set before the first game so it’s unlikely Norman Reedus would appear as he is the cause of the Death Stranding. Experiments were conducted to study The Beach, and baby BB. The child is accidentally killed and arrives at the Beach, the junction between the worlds of the living and the dead. His sister/mother/extinction entity pal, Amelie, returns BB – aka Sam – back to the world of the living, thus causing Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Although Norman wouldn’t be in the film it does open the doors for the likes of Lindsay Wagner and Mads Mikkelsen to appear in the movie.</p>

<p><em><strong>End of Spoilers!</strong></em></p>
<p>Back in the world of video games Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5. No other versions have been revealed but as the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox , as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content, it will probably go multi-platform at some point in the future.</p>
