		<p>Commodore Amiga owners were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWBSnBsCW5Y">spoilt for superb shoot ’em ups</a> with original games such as&nbsp; Xenon II, Project X, Swiv,&nbsp; and Bloody Money, and superb arcade ports such as R-Type.&nbsp;One title that stood out from the crowd was Apidiya, a game that ditched spaceships and battle stations and replaced them with insects and ponds.&nbsp; It was totally unique and it’s coming back in almost exactly the same form.</p>
<p>Apidya Special is a full remake rather than an emulated version of the original Amiga title and it’s been developed by the original team, together with a devoted Apidya super-fan-turned-developer. The new version is based on an unreleased console port from the 90s, presumably the Sega Megadrive version, and uses the original assets along with brand new pixel art.&nbsp; There’s also a new version of the soundtrack by legendary 16-bit composer Chris Hülsbeck.</p>

<p>“We never thought we’d return to Apidya after all these years,” said Peter Thierolf, original creator of the game. “but with new technology, the right team, and the passion of the community, we can finally deliver the version we always dreamed about.”</p>
<p>While remaining true to the original game there some new features that have been added, check them out:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-to-get-a-%E2%80%9Cspecial-announcement%E2%80%9D.1273890/</guid>

		<p>If you’re not up to speed on Hollow Knight: Silksong, here’s the short version. It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-silksong-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch/">announced in February 2019</a>, but then updates were few and far between until a new trailer was revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed/">officially delayed in May 2023</a>, and then in April 2025 it appeared in a sizzle reel for Nintendo with a 2025 release date.</p>
<p>However, the lack of communication and six-year (and counting) development time has led fans to joke that the game will never come out.&nbsp; A playable demo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-at-the-xbox-gamescom-booth-this-year/">should be on the floor</a> at Gamescom 2025 starting tomorrow, but as there was a playable demo in 2019 that doesn’t mean much to the fans.</p>


<p>In a massive tease, Team Cherry have now posted a video that will launch a “Special Announcement” for the game at 3.30pm on 21st August.&nbsp; The internet has responded in the only way possible by suggesting that the big announcement is that the game is cancelled.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was scheduled to come to PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, and Xbox, and was also meant to be a Day One launch on Game Pass. However, some of those details are now years old so things may have changed since then.</p>

<p>Here’s a little more about the game, but again, this is from previous announcements so may not be accurate.</p>
<p><em>Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world. She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.</em></p>
<p><em>Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She’ll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom’s challenges. Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights – Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!</em></p>
<p><em>The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score. In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.</em></p>
