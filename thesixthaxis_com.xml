		<p>While Nintendo talked a bunch about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> paid upgrades of a select few original Switch games, there’s also some titles that will be getting free upgrades to support the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system will be released for select Nintendo Switch games,” Nintendo states.</p>
<p>“By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These updates will work on multiple levels. Simplistically, they can offer visual improvements through higher resolutions and improved frame rates – this will be a boon for both The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of Wisdom, not to mention Pokémon Scarlet and Violet – but there are also patches to enable GameShare for titles with multiplayer.</p>


<p>GameShare lets a single copy of a game be used to share multiplayer access to other consoles, both locally for Switch and Switch 2 devices, and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a> for Switch 2. This is great for when you just want to each have your own personal screen instead of sharing a TV, games where all players might have different viewpoints and camera angles, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">See here for more details for how GameShare works on Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ARMS</li>
<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker <em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</li>
<li>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain <em>– GameShare</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between a free update and a Switch 2 Edition paid upgrade seems to be whether or not Nintendo is adding significant content to their games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> are both getting major content expansions, while the improvements for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> extend to HDR support and Switch Online app support (and these updates can be had when bundled in with Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Cross-gen games like Metroid Prime 4 are more straightforward.</p>
<p>For the free upgrades, they could be as simple as lifting the dynamic resolution bounds and any frame rate caps to let the Switch 2 stretch its legs. We’d love to see similar for games with iffy visual quality and frame rates on the original Switch, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p>

<p>All of this means that third party developers are free to choose their own path. 2K are going down the paid upgrade path for Civilization 7, but other developers will no doubt choose free patches.</p>

		<p>Nintendo is revitalising one of their favourite multiplayer game concepts for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with GameShare, letting you share multiplayer games with other Switch owners, using just a single copy of a game.</p>
<p>This is different to PlayStation’s SharePlay, which streams a gameplay video to invited players, but is instead beaming game code to the other systems, letting them run the game on-device and with each player having a bespoke viewpoint, depending on the game.</p>


<p>GameShare will work both over local wireless and over the internet via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a>, but it will be more limited in that second scenario.</p>

<p>Locally, a Nintendo Switch 2 can share a multiplayer game with both Switch 2 and original Switch consoles (depending on the game), but GameChat is a Switch 2 exclusive feature, so online GameShare only works with Switch 2 consoles. Additionally, some games will only have local GameShare enabled and block online play.</p>


<p>Six Nintendo Switch games are getting upgrades to support GameShare on the Nintendo Switch 2, most of them free.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/11/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch-review/">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain-review/">Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> Switch 2 Edition – <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Paid upgrade</a>, and no GameChat sharing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a very different style of game. 51 Worldwide Games is packed full of boardgames, so each player can have different views of a chess board, for example. Treasure Tracker and 3D World are both isometric platformers from the Wii U with fully separate character control, while Super Mario Odyssey’s multiplayer is restricted to the second player being Cappy.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this concept many times in the past, whether it was the limited cable linked multiplayer of GBA games, giving small portions of games to those without a cartridge, or the same idea wirelessly with later handhelds like the 3DS – I think Tri-Force Heroes had this feature? – and it will be interesting to see just how extensively this is featured in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>
