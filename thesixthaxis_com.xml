		<p>The Mafia <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">social media</a> account kept things pretty tame this week just saying “See you at [The Game Awards]” and sure enough they were there.&nbsp; The new trailer (some of which leaked earlier today) gives us a release date of Summer 2025 which is much sooner than expected, previously Hangar 13 had said the game is “years” away.</p>
<p>Here is the trailer!</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - The Initiation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkdV6NxPOLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Meet Enzo Favara, who sinks into the criminal underworld on Siciliy in the early 1900s. You’ll have to fight to survive in this dangerous era, and the game looks great from the few snippets of actual action with really fluid animations to go with the bleeding edge graphics.</p>
<p>“Across the first three entries in the&nbsp;Mafia&nbsp;franchise, we introduced players to the world of the Mafia through brutal stories set in different eras,” said Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13. “In&nbsp;Mafia: The Old Country, we’re going back to the roots of what fans love about the franchise, crafting a deep, linear narrative with that classic mob movie feeling, visiting a stunning new setting, and delivering it all in a tight, focused package perfect for fans of immersive experiences.”</p>

<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam.</p>

		<p>Capcom is reviving another of their classic franchises with Onimusha: Way of the Sword set to come out in 2026!</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha Way of the Sword Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xQa_iW958E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay.</p>
<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though.</p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

		<p>Is it me, or is The Game Awards really good this year? It’s made all the better because one of the key announcements was the upcoming arrival of a brand new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. Seriously, if you lived on the Sega side of the street, you never needed to bother with Tekken, because Virtua Fighter was – to my mind anyway – vastly superior. The fact that it’s going to go up against the fantastic Tekken 8 means that 3D-fighting fans are really eating well right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW VIRTUA FIGHTER Project | World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmeGL2JP9N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer was a particularly teasy trailer, as it only gave us a few details. First amongst them was that once again it’s the Ryu Ga Gotoku studio that’s working on this new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. You might know them as the team behind the huge Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, and given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which in turn fed from Virtua Fighter, made them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going at it in a sandy cityscape, with Akira sporting a new undercover look – that’s a fedora and trenchcoat if you were wondering – before then shifting perspective to point us towards an upcoming VF Direct where we’ll learn (hopefully) all the most important details.</p>
<p>Fans of the series – myself included – have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now, so I’m hoping that with the new title coming a few more people will hop in so I can practice poking them with Lion’s silly pointy fingers.</p>

<p>The VF Direct will take place on December 13th at 12am ET. Stay tuned for more as we have it</p>

		<p>The first of two big and bold game reveals, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, which seems to be a Like a Dragon game that takes us back to 1915 Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Century Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JanPitSWd94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Century is set in a particularly interesting point in time, both as newer technologies like record players filter into society, but also as more and more morsels of Western culture could filter through to Japan.</p>
<p>Of course, you know what was around back then? Gangs. Fisticuffs. Smoking. Looking cool.</p>
