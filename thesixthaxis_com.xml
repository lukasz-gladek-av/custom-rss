		<p>For the best part of a decade we’ve explored video games through a historic lens in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, studying AAA blockbusters such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> to indie gems like <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/radio-commander">Radio Commander</a>, examining the real-world people, events, and cultures that inspired them.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Playing With History is to become a premium print publication with its first volume heading to crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, later this year. Available digitally and in both paperback and hardback, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History: Volume One</a> promises over 200 pages of developer interviews, deep dives, and retrospectives, all presented in a visually arresting format.</p>
<div id="attachment_457611"><p id="caption-attachment-457611">Battlefield: The Endless War For Wake Island is just one of many original articles created for Playing With History.</p></div>
<p>Together, with video game creatives and historians, we investigate a wide spectrum of historic eras and how they are represented, from the prehistoric playgrounds of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>’s nightmarish Normandy landings and far beyond. Whether it’s Romans, Vikings, samurai, or pirates, we leave no virtual stone unturned, with plenty of fascinating detours along the way.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the project and get notified when the campaign goes live, please visit the Playing With History Volume One <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">pre-launch hub</a>. For regular updates you can follow us over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playingwithhistory.bsky.social">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/PlayingxHistory">X</a>. In the meantime, to whet your time-travelling appetites, we’ve collated a Playing With History archive below (several of these articles will be adapted into the final book alongside new and original stories).</p>

		<p>Clearly, we don’t know much about Death Stranding 2 as we’ve now had over forty minutes of trailers and every one&nbsp; of these has revealed something new. The latest, which also reveals a launch date of June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5, starts on shocking conversation.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?start=300&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We then get some backstory to explain exactly what has happened since the last game with humanity reconnecting (which, it turns out, was a very bad idea) and allowing automated deliveries, making Sam’s job as a postman obsolete. He has other things to do this time with a rise of a cult and Baby Lou to look after.&nbsp; Kojima hasn’t lost his touch with needle drops either, the trailer includes the haunting song&nbsp; “Too the Wilder” by Woodkid.</p>
<p>We also get a look at some new Tar enemies, new locations, new characters, and rather excitingly, motorcycle battles! Also, tentacles, lots of tentacles, mostly in places where tentacles should not be. Sadly there is no confirmation that we will get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/penis-fans-outraged-to-discover-norman-reedus-has-no-dinkle-in-death-stranding/">to see Little Norman in the game.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/29/check-out-20-minutes-from-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Previous trailers</a> have shown us Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow posing for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project. If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p>The game will launch with a Digital Deluxe Edition which will cost $10 above the standard $69.99 price and includes some in-game bonus items.&nbsp; The Collector’s Edition will cost an eye watering $230 and includes a statue.</p>

<p>Since its launch on PS4 the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content.</p>
