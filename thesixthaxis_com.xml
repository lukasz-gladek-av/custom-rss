		<p>Videogamer, a once respected gaming site, is now seemingly only posting content created by AI.&nbsp; Investigations by various outlets, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-metacritic-ai-review-videogamer-2000674042">Kotaku</a>, have revealed that the new “staff” have AI photos, have brand new social media accounts, and, despite their bios suggesting they have been writing about video games and tech for years, no one has ever heard of them.</p>
<p>This came to the fore when a review for Resident Evil Requiem was posted, which was clearly written by AI, and this was included on Metacritic.</p>


<p>“Metacritic has been a reputable review source for a quarter century and has maintained a rigorous vetting process when adding new publications to our slate of critics,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told&nbsp;Kotaku. “However, in certain instances such as a publication being sold or a writing staff having turned over, problems can arise such as plagiarism, theft, or other forms of fraud including AI-generated reviews.”</p>
<p>“Metacritic’s policy is to never include an AI-generated critic review on Metacritic and if we discover that one has been posted, we’ll remove it immediately and sever ties with that publication indefinitely pending a thorough investigation.”</p>
<p>A number of other reviews from Videogamer, including a Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen , have also been removed.</p>

<p>Videogamer was sold to a company called BGFG, which pushes online casinos and gambling. Google the name Videogamer now and the site states it is a “source for video and casino game news.”</p>

		<p>The closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bluepoint-games/">Bluepoint Games</a> has once again raised the question of why they were never tasked to remake Bloodborne for PS5. Fans wanted it, and it seems a perfect fit for the studio, so why did it not happen?</p>
<p>Over on Bloomberg, Jason Schreier has said that Bluepoint did indeed pitch to remake Bloodborne in 2025 and “the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">interview</a> last year, former PlayStation Boss Shuhei Yoshida seemingly backed this up, saying FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki did want more from the Bloodborne world, perhaps including a remake, but he is far too busy and &nbsp;“doesn’t want anyone else to touch it.”</p>


<p>Sony do not need FromSoftware’s permission, they own Bloodborne, but Sony would rather keep FromSoftware happy rather than go ahead with any remake. FromSoftware had a massive hit with Elden Ring, and they are still open to exclusives as their next game, The Duskbloods, is only on Switch 2, so Sony keeping them onside with a view to a future exclusive makes sense.</p>


<p>Bloodborne is still selling well, with nearly 2 million units sold between February 2022 and November 2025, 10 years after it launched.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had previously been working on a live service game in the God of War universe in which Atreus would have found himself in the Underworld and battling to escape. That was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/"> cancelled in January 2025</a> along with the live service game that Sony Bend had been working on. Details of the Bend game have never been released.</p>
<p>Right now, you can play two of Sony live service games that managed to escape the axe, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Marathon">Marathon </a>and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>.&nbsp; They also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/jade-raymond-has-now-left-haven-studios-leaves-questions-over-playstation-live-service-fairgames/">Fairgame$</a> in development, an extraction shooter that sounds like it may compete with Marathon for players.</p>
