		<p>It’s pinch, punch, first of the month time, and since it’s November, I hope you managed to survive last night with only treats and no tricks. Thankfully my supply of sweets was just enough to survive the glut of kids of all ages knocking on our door, so I didn’t have to break into my <em>actual</em> stash of sweets to appease the last kids in the final crowd that knocked.</p>
<p>But now that we’re free from this terror, what’s on the agenda for this weekend? Perhaps some ARC Raiders? Maybe avoiding the Battlefield battle royale? Perhaps some Football Managering?</p>

<p>And since it’s spooky season, Steve had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/31/7-indie-horror-games-to-ease-the-wait-for-resident-evil-requiem/"><strong>a bunch of indie horror games</strong></a> for you to check out while still waiting for Resident Evil: Requiem next year.</p>
