		<p>FromSoftware are back with a new spin off from The Elden Ring and this time you can bring your friends. The Elden Ring: Nightreign looks to take the setting and combat from the original title but allow you to team up with two co-op&nbsp; friends and battle in a map based on Elden Ring’s Limgrave area.</p>
<p>Technically Elden Ring also has multiplayer, this just looks like it’s making it more important</p>


<p>The game will have random enemies and features that will change with every game, and it will be coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p>

<p>FromSoftware<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/no-plans-for-elden-ring-2-say-fromsoftware/"> have said that they are not working on Elden Ring 2</a> . “We’re not really considering developments such as an Elden Ring 2,” said Miyazaki, but then acknowledge that they may work on the sequel in the future. He also suggested the franchise could continue in another form such as a movie or animated series.</p>

<p>Well, now we know what they were working on!</p>

		<p>CD Projekt Red has revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> with the very first trailer for the game, featuring Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher IV — Cinematic Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54dabgZJ5YA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A gorgeously rendered story trailer, it depicts a girl who is being dressed and prepared for sacrifice to the evils of the world to save the village. Except there’s a Witcher in town to fight the evil for them instead, and that Witcher is…. Ciri!</p>
<p>Here’s CDPR’s blurb:</p>
<p>“The Witcher IV is a single-player, open-world RPG from CD PROJEKT RED. At the start of a new saga, players take on the role of Ciri, a professional monster slayer, and embark on a journey through a brutal dark-fantasy world. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it aims to be the most immersive and ambitious open-world Witcher game to date.”</p>

<p>We are still many years away from the release of The Witcher 4, with CDPR confirming just a couple weeks ago that the game had now entered full production.</p>
<p>This trailer is also a showcase for what CDPR is shooting for with the new game engine.&nbsp;CDPR has made the jump away from their own in-house game engine to using Unreal Engine 5. That, as we’ve even seen from studios coming over from Unreal Engine 4, has a significant impact on the production pipeline, as developers and artists look to integrate features like Nanite textures and Lumen global illumination into the game.</p>

		<p>Sloclap has revealed Rematch, bringing the style of animation and martial artistry honed through the making of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sifu">Sifu</a> to create an online football game!</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q2qdTSuOaw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This isn’t 11v11, but rather a 5v5 game with a bit of the style and flair of Rocket League to it. Here’s some blurb from the trailer:</p>
<p>“Rematch brings a fresh take on football with immersive third-person action, skill-based gameplay, and intense online competition. Team up with your friends and tackle, dribble, aim, and shoot your way to victory in fast-paced 5v5 matches where every move matters.”</p>
<p>Rematch is coming in summer 2025 to PC, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. If you want to play it earlier, you can sign up to the pre-release beta tests. Beta periods are invite-only and spots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/beta-environment">head here to sign up</a>.</p>

		<p>Legendary immersive sim developer Warren Spector has given a first look at the next game that he and the team at OtherSide Entertainment are working on: Thick as Thieves.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thick As Thieves - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fg_EZZgGH5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Thick as Thieves is steeped in immersive sims, but has been given a dash of multiplayer to it. Set in a fantasy city, you’ll seemingly take on jobs to perform heists and crimes, only to discover that you’re actually in a race with rival criminals to pull off the same job.</p>
<p>Here’s some trailer blurb:</p>
<p>“A PvPvE multiplayer stealth game set in a 1910s metropolis filled with magic and intrigue. Hide, sneak, and steal your way through the ranks as you match your cunning against rival thieves in an immersive living world of stories and shadows.”</p>

<p>Previously announced earlier this year, this is the first look that we have at Thick as Thieves. It looks rather intriguing, and will be fascinating to see how they can blend together a traditionally solitary subgenre with more competitive multiplayer.</p>
<p>Thick as Thieves is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
