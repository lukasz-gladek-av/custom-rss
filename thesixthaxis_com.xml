		<p>There’s a good bit for Xbox fans in this set of five Most Wanted 2025 games, with a pair of exclusives that are coming from Compulsion Games and Playground Games respectively. Sure, we might have doubts about whether they’ll stay as exclusives for very long, these days, but they should be a good reason to pick up an asymmetrical gamepad… or boot up your gaming PC.</p>
<h2>20 – Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Morphing out of the DLC plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has grown into a standalone game, bringing back the fan favourite protagonist from the original game, Kyle Crane. It’s been thirteen years since we last saw him, and he’s now exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a region filled with both human factions and monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kyle himself is no longer truly human, the zombie DNA fully merging with his own to provide some major new powers – he is the titular Beast, if you hadn’t guessed.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on back at Gamescom 2024, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">check out our preview impressions here</a>.</p>
<h2>19 – Two Point Museum</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 4th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Having revolutionised healthcare and teaching across Two Point County, where to next for this tongue-in-cheek management sim series? Well, why not dust some old bones and tomes in the museums of this world? Also… ghosts?</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum Preview – We played the&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life &amp; Supernatural museums" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLbM27hYcsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two Point Museum is bringing plenty of new ideas to the table, as you build out museums around each theme, soak in all of the pun-laden artefacts and beings that you can exhibit, and curate entertaining tours to inform and enlighten your visitors… and convince them to toss a coin into your donation pitcher.</p>
<p>We’ve played the opening few levels and had a grand time digging into the new setting. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/03/two-point-museum-preview-dino-bones-funny-fishies-spooky-spectres/">Read our Two Point Museum preview here</a>.</p>
<h2>18 – South of Midnight</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from Compulsion Games, the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/09/we-happy-few-review/">We Happy Few</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> looks to be something rather different, whisking us away to the fantasy world of Prospero and confronting our heroine Hazel with giant sea monsters.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLBOyKqw58A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features an almost claymation visual style, blending together action adventure exploration with Bayonetta-style combat. The world blends together vibes of the deep south of America with giant, island-sized alligators and more, which you’ll come across after a hurricane has ripped across this world.</p>
<h2>17 – Civilization VII</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 11th February 2025</em></p>
<p>There’s been a good few pretenders to the throne emerging over the last few years, but Civilization VII is arriving in just over a month to firmly put its stamp on the historical 4X genre once more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game will tackle the concept of shifting ages, just as the genre as a whole has been. Split into three distinct ages – Antiquity, Exploration and Modern – each civ is restricted to a particular time period and then has to grow and morph into another through a point of crisis. Rome will eventually fall, but that can provide the historical and gameplay foundations to become any number of medieval empires – the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps? – and from there lead into modern European nations.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with Civ VII back at Gamescom 2024</a>, as well as having the opportunity to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/interview-ed-beach-on-civilization-vii-ages-diplomacy-security-blankets/">speak with Creative Director Ed Beach</a> about this major new direction for the series.</p>
<h2>16 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>We’re putting a lot of trust in Playground Games and Xbox with this one. It’s been years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">the formal announcement of Fable in 2020</a>, which had already been long-rumoured to be in the works, and every occasional reappearance at Xbox showcases has been heavily reliant on lusciously produced cinematics and an understated British sense of humour, rather than gameplay. Still, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> is supposedly on track for release in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FiBmVBaY0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To be charitable, the most recent trailer from last June does state that it’s “in-game footage” and shift between clips that could be representative of in-game dialogue scenes and wandering through the environments, building up to some quick shots of combat. It does look very, very pretty, as the baton is passed from the now retired hero Humphry to a new hero.</p>
<p>One we want to see much, much more of, and which we’d expect is coming later, rather than sooner. There’s other big first party Xbox games expected before then!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>That’s not the half of it for Xbox and PC gamers this year, with more exclusives still to come as we approach the top 10.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Lenovo Legion Go S will be the first third party SteamOS handheld]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/the-lenovo-legion-go-s-will-be-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lenovo-legion-go-s-will-be-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld.1076817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/the-lenovo-legion-go-s-will-be-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve and Lenovo have announced that they’re bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steamos">SteamOS</a> to the Lenovo Legion Go S, making it the first officially licensed third party handheld that can be powered by Valve’s gaming-oriented branch of Linux.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also be available with Windows 11, but there’s a big price advantage if you opt for SteamOS. The Windows edition will have an entry level price of $600, but you can save $100 by going with SteamOS, this edition costing $500 instead. The entry level models will be available from May 2025, though a Windows edition Legion Go S will debut later this month, starting at $730 for that particular configuration.</p>


<p>This is part of a big new push for the handheld PC gaming market by Lenovo. The Legion Go S is a slightly smaller 8″ rendition of the upcoming Legion Go 2, which has an 8.8″ display. The Go S’s 8″ screen is still impressive, with a 1920×1200 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, this is allied with the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. All models come with Wi-Fi 6e support, a pair of USB 4 ports and a microSD card slot as well.</p>
<p>This follows through on Valve’s plan to open up SteamOS to third parties once again. The gaming OS originally debuted with Steam Machines back in the day, but its return with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> has been exclusive to Valve’s own handheld up until this point. Last year they talked about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">porting it to the Asus ROG Ally</a>, for example.</p>
<p>The tricky thing for Valve is that, where SteamOS was able to target Steam Deck as a fixed platform, where they were able to leverage specific hardware features for the screen, implement quick suspend / resume and other tweaks, it’s trickier to be a more general OS.</p>

<p>A lot of PC handhelds have common ground to the Steam Deck by using AMD integrated chipsets as their foundation, but everything else will require dedicated support. That can be the display driver to enable VRR and other refresh rate controls, supporting back buttons, different Wi-Fi chipsets, and much more. Still, Valve is committing to providing the same experience to their new and upcoming partners, and many gamers are hoping that they’ll offer SteamOS as a basic download that anyone can use with their game PC – handheld, laptop, or desktop.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 is coming in February]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-2-is-coming-in-february.1076811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-2-is-coming-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a good time to be a Monster Hunter fan, what with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> coming on 28th February… but what if you want to play sooner? Well, Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has good news for you, announcing that Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 is also coming in February!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?start=12&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 will take place across two weekends, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, with crossplay enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekend 1</strong> – Thursday 6th February 7PM PT through Sunday 9th February 6:59PM PT</li>
<li><strong>Weekend 2</strong> – Thursday 13th February 7PM PT through Sunday 16th February 6:59PM PT</li>
</ul>
<p>That translates to a 3AM start time on Friday mornings in the UK.</p>
<p>Open Beta Test 2 will expand on the first beta test with some additional monsters for you to take on. In addition to the full character creation suite, the story trial and the slay Doshaguma quest, you’ll also be able to hunt Gypceros.</p>

<p>You can carry forward your characters created for the first beta test, and that can also be transferred to the full game, though game progress is not transferring. If you do take part in the beta, you’ll also get a cute little charm for your weapon or Seikret.</p>
<p>The development team does warn that outside of content this will not be a significant shift when compared to the first beta. This includes adjustments to performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more that will only be made for the full game. Capcom detailed the changes being made in a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/monster-hunter-wilds-pre-launch-update-addresses-open-beta-issues/">community update</a> back in December.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game last year, sharing impressions in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>. Nic said, “Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say — I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.”</p>
