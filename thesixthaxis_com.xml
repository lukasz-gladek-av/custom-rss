			<p>LEGO Voyagers might just be the cutest game ever. As my partner and I guided our adorable single-block Lego pieces though this co-op puzzle platformer, we emitted many a coo of ‘ooohhhh’ and ‘aaahhhh’, and thankfully it wasn’t followed by running and screaming. But is there more to Light Brick Studios’ latest LEGO adventure than looking disarmingly delightful?</p>

<p>Akin to the local and online co-op experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">offered by Hazelight Studios</a>, Lego Voyagers requires two players to work together to navigate through its isometric levels. Your eyed Lego pieces are steered like rolling wagon wheels, tumbling through the environment with clumsy abandon. Most of the levels are made up of those smooth Lego pieces that are much easier to dust on your display models than the studded ones. Though, every now and again, you’ll find some studs to attach to with the tap of a button. Like Katamari Damacy, you can end up coated in chunks of plastic, each impacting the physics of your character, causing you to trundle hilariously – and precariously – around the place.</p>


<p>Even better, both players can connect together with a stupendously satisfying ‘click’, and then can both take control of your Frankenstein-like Lego monstrosity, requiring you to work together to get around the place. It’s tremendous silly fun, and, thanks to a very quick respawn, frustration caused by the chaos is kept to an absolute minimum. Having said that, despite the kid friendly visuals, I can’t help but feel that the challenging physics-based controls might not make this one suitable to play with the smallest Lego-fans in your family.</p>


<p>Platforming is simple, which is a relief, as the isometric viewpoint prevents anything more complex. Even simple jumps are made agonisingly tricky by often being unable to tell where your player character is in the space. Once more, that aforementioned rapid respawn saves the day. Even if you’ve failed a basic jump several times or more, you’re hurled back into the action before irritation sets in.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hit and miss platforming, the puzzles are a delight, requiring both players to work together to solve numerous satisfyingly brain-ticking conundrums. One player might be tasked with controlling a bridge say, whilst the other player crosses it safely – or unsafely, if the first player is feeling cheeky. In my case, I often am.</p>
<p>The best puzzles are those that involve building something together from the random bits and bobs you find littered around the landscape. Often, you don’t quite know what you are building until suddenly the penny drops and you realise, you’re halfway through constructing a catapult to haphazardly fling your buddy over a hazardous ravine! Or, in a page straight out of Hazelight Studios’ co-op book, you’re tasked with controlling a boat together, one playing steering, the other accelerating. It’s easy charming fun, the game breezily flinging ideas at you, never waiting too long before moving onto the next one.</p>

<p>The only downside? It’s all over far too quickly. As such, it never quite feels like the game explores any one idea to a satisfying conclusion. You do a bit of something, it’s enjoyable, but it always feels like the mechanic could be further explored. Light Brick Studios clearly doesn’t want to stick with an idea too long, just in case you get bored. This, combined with a very short run time of a handful of hours, means that whilst Lego Voyagers is tremendous fun, it’s likely done and forgotten before the end credits have finished rolling.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Silly, creative fun, LEGO Voyagers is just like the toy it's based upon. If only there was a bit more to it, then we could have had a real contender for a great Lego video game.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Discounty is a cosy Supermarket simulator in the vein of Stardew Valley. You’ll be ordering products, stocking shelves, and then selling them to the various townsfolk of Blomkest in an effort to expand your business. Unfortunately along with that comes dealing with inattentive local government, shady local businesses, and backstabbing journalists as it seems something in this town is rotten. And all you wanted to do was run a supermarket.</p>
<p><iframe title="Discounty | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbNGAedv08M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You arrive in the town of Blomkest to take over and reinvigorate your Aunt’s business, the local Discounty supermarket, where “everything’s always on sale!” As you wander through the town, you stroll past the bank, town hall, a bar, all the usual places you might expect, but there’s also abandoned buildings dotted around and a memorial museum that is no longer maintained since the council cut funding. Then you’re shown to the trailer where you live for the whole game – no house upgrades here – and told to ignore the mysterious shed behind it that emanates strange noises.</p>


<p>As you get stuck into managing the supermarket, you’ll be ordering stuff, putting it on display, and then manning the cash registers. You don’t set the prices yourself, instead hammering them into a calculator based on the price in your big book of products. It’s pretty enjoyable at first. There’s a zen-like calmness to it when you don’t have too many customers, but when you do, you to have to rush around refilling shelves whilst also serving them and cleaning the floor, which is hectic and results in frustrated customers. I quickly decided to have multiple shelves with the same item at a time so I didn’t have to rush around so much. With a bit of mental maths, you can speed up manning the till as well, saving yourself from the angry faces from impatient customers.</p>


<p>But there’s a litany of things that get in the way of this. Most products are bought form a computer and then quickly delivered by a guy called Guy, which is perfect. You do also need to arrange trade deals with local businesses for access to their products, though, which means running around town every time you want to restock their products, upgrade the trade deal, or ask them something. Stocking your shelves limits you to grabbing things from the store room in groups of five. Only need to display two toilet rolls? For some reason have to pick up five and put three back, adding unnecessary time and fiddliness.</p>
<p>As customers shuffle around once you open at 9AM, they leave scuff marks on the floor, but you can only clean two scuffs at a time with soap before needing to take the bucket back. Then one of the customers who got everything they were shopping for and, if anything, you managed to serve quicker than the others leaves with an angry face for no discernible reason – nothing you can do about that. At the end of the day, 5PM, you close the shop and sit through the unskippable summary of sales, which is doubly redundant as you need to manually keep track of stock, and because you served everyone yourself. The only information I really need on this page is how much money I made and it doesn’t need to be listed per product, one at a time, whilst I wait for it to finish.</p>

<p>The shop doesn’t open on Sunday, so you might as well skip the day and get through to Monday, where you’ll have to replace all the posters around town, because they’re removed every weekend for no good reason. Oh, but you’ve probably forgotten to print them and the only printer in town, which is in the town hall, takes eight in-game hours to print a single one.</p>
<p>I quickly lost my enjoyment of Discounty because of all these elements. Management games can be cosy, but not when constantly putting frustrations in my path. I was enjoying completing small challenges to unlock more products, add more pockets to my outfit, get an improved scanner, and the actual act of selling was fun, but restocking while serving customers is&nbsp;next to impossible when there’s a lot of customers without angering them all. Every time one of the issues above shows itself again – which is pretty much every day for some of them – my enjoyment diminishes.</p>
<p>The overarching storyline seemed like it might be a plus at first as well, but something isn’t quite right. Sometimes plot threads are just left unresolved. You start out in a trailer and that seems like a signal for “you’ll be able to upgrade to a house at some point,” and the abandoned house you find shortly afterwards reinforces this, but in the end it just doesn’t happen. Then there’s the townsfolk, who are the most infuriating and obnoxious group of NPCs I’ve ever encountered. Everyone is gossiping, myself included, but one character admonished me for apparently starting a conversation with gossip about her own son – all I did was press to interact! Elmer in the town hall has be constantly hounded to do things he’s supposed to, such as removing a tree that is cutting off the only access to nearby farms, or fixing a broken staircase.</p>

<p>All of this involves sprinting across Blomkest on top of your other outings to restock your trade deal products that only restock on specific days. It’s infuriating. I just wanted to run a supermarket, not deal with red tape, incompetent government officials, unpleasant people, and getting loans. Even your Aunt in the game says “I didn’t catch you slacking, did I?” as she enters the store you moved into town to revitalise for her. Everyone just seems so unpleasant, and the “small town drama” promised by the game’s marketing just means whe the worst person you know would describe as “spilling tea”, as they spread rumours and bad mouth people behind their backs.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, I’ve been playing on a Switch, and my experience hasn’t been great. There’s no crashing or anything, but anytime you’re outside of a small building the frame rate tanks noticeably. It’s a very nice looking game as far as pixel art goes, with plenty of nice looking visual effects depending on what time of day it is, but the frame rate is consistently terrible when outside. There’s also some small oversights in behaviours, such as once when a staircase was blocked off for way longer than it was supposed to, but I saw Barbara, my fishy sticks supplier and uses the stairs in her commute, walk straight through it without so much as a pause.</p>
