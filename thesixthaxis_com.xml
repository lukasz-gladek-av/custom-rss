		<p>Just when the year was about to finish, and you thought you’d seen everything the game world has to offer, along comes the Indie Live Expo to throw a massive indie-game-shaped curveball. Set to take place on Saturday, the 29th of November, the stream will showcase over 100 different indie games, taking us from the close of 2025 into what we can expect from 2026’s release schedule, while celebrating the best indie games released this year.</p>
