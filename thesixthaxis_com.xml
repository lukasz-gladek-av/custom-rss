		<p>Sometimes, video games are just pure, chaotic joy. Sure, we’ve got plenty of cosy adventures where you can pet the cat and launch a coffee shop, but unadulterated violence and mayhem are pretty popular (in the make-believe, pixellated forum, not so much in the real world. Sodaman is just about to launch into Early Access on the 17th of February, and this is one game where pixellated, chaotic violence looks as though it’s going to be a heck of a lot of fun.</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_JjGBWpL_hjhGrPiYxflXq0lnHnlMIJn</p>


<p>Unsurprisingly, for a game called Sodaman, cans of soda (that’s pop to you UK readers), are integral and important, with Sodaman utilising his favourite fizzy beverages to power up his blasting and fighting powers. Set in a cyberpunk futuristic society, and pulling together the ever-popular Roguelike and Bullet Heaven genres, Sodaman has definitely taken a slurp of Hades and a sip of Death Must Die on its way to fruition. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the development team at Tape Corps have also included Balatro as in influence, so the way that you steadily improve your abilities in each run might take inspiration from there. Or you’re going to be firing Jokers at the bad guys that give you insane multipliers. Either sounds good.</p>
<p>While Sodamans powers are enhanced by the fizzy stuff, you can also pour them together to create hybrid, unusual drinks that are even more powerful. Like mixing Pepsi and Lilt. Wouldn’t that be something?</p>

<p>Sodaman, which will be published by GameDev.ist, will launch with a very reasonable price tag of $4.99 during Early Access on Steam. There’ll aslo be a 20% discount for two weeks following the Early Access exit. As you should expect, this is an unfinished project, and the team at Tape Corps will be paying close attention to player feedback during Early Access. It definitely looks like it’s worth jumping into!</p>
