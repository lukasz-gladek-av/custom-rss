		<p>Some of you may not remember it, but back in 2010, Hydrophobia was a pretty big deal. Not because it was a well lauded and much loved game, but because it wasn’t. In fact, the original release of Hydrophobia was met with so much negativity that the developers Dark Energy Digital reworked it, changed a voice actor, overhauled levels, and added a final boss. This new package was released in 2011 as Hyrdophobia Prophecy. It was supposed to be the start of a trilogy, but the difficulties the game faced saw Dark Energy Digital go out of business, leaving us with just the first part of this story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hydrophobia Prophecy Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RzSF0EV-84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other reason that Hydrophobia Prophecy was a big story at the time was its water tech, which was the basis of the game’s HydroEngine. This engine allowed water to flow and move just like it does in reality, which really helped the game stand out for at the time. Water is almost ever present throughout Hydrophobia Prophecy, set on the giant city ship The Queen of the World as it comes under attack by the terrorist group the Neo-Malthusians. The world is in an overpopulation crisis, so this group wants to kill off the majority of the human population so the survivors – themselves, of course – can flourish.</p>


<p>Kate Wilson is merely an engineer aboard the ship, but she has to fight back against the Neo-Malthusians in order to save it, the people, and the research being carried out on it. She is joined by Scoot, her manager who is no more than a guiding voice. In the original Hyrdophobia, Scoot had a Scottish accent, but this voice was one of the complaints players of the original release had, so in Prophecy his voice was replaced by a more neutral North American accent. His role is to help guide Kate through the ship, though plenty of waypoints make that easy, as well as to make the occasional quip when Kate kills a Neo-Malthusian.</p>


<p>For a game that’s two generations old, there are still elements of Hydrophobia: Prophecy that feel fresh. The most obvious is how water moves through levels and areas, and the other is the underwater combat. These moments add a proper three dimensional combat situation where you are not just trying to shoot at the enemies on the platforms in front of you and behind you, but also those that are swimming around, below, and above you. These are proper cat and mouse moments, as you may spot an enemy swimming below and manage to get your shots off first, or you may suddenly be under fire from an unexpected angle, requiring you to get Kate’s bearings right to respond in kind.</p>
<p>Kate’s gun has different ammo types, with the basic round being a shock round which is unlimited. This joined by rapid fire, gel, and energy rounds later to give different advantages. However, shock alone is pretty handy throughout the game. Charge a shock round up, and you could take an enemy out in one hit. They can also destroy hazards including loose wires that are sending electricity into the water, making areas impassable. The game is littered with these basic puzzles, though it can also use elements in more novel ways. One such example is collecting floating tanks and putting them into heavy containers to make them float up to unblock passages.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Hydrophobia: Prophecy is that it ends just as it is getting going. The third and final act, just before you face off with the boss, gives Kate the ability to control water. You can tell the development team would have expanded on these further in future releases, as this lets Kate summon a water tower and throw objects through that final boss fight against a giant security bot. Once that fight is over, the story ends, and while a challenge mode lets you use the water powers in some scenarios, it’s simply not enough.</p>
<p>In some ways, Hyrdophobia: Prophecy was ahead of its time. It was one of the earliest tales of a developer reacting to audience feedback to build a better experience, and this resulted in a more competent, if somewhat by the numbers third person shooter. Yet it pushed tech in other ways with the water physics and rendering a still impressive element. It is unfortunate that the trilogy never materialised to continue Kate’s story. Just imagine what things could have been like if the HydroEngine had been refined further and the tech used in more games in the early 2010s.</p>

		<p>This last week has whizzed by, and perhaps some of that was down to the joy I found in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-confirms-open-beta-for-next-week/">Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a>. It’s a true sequel to Monster Hunter Worlds, and while I’m very sad to see the Palamutes and Wirebugs of Monster Hunter Rise head off into the sunset, I’m more than happy with what Capcom are serving up! Other than that, there’s been more Metaphor ReFantazio, a heap of Empire of the Ants and a sniff of F1 24.</p>
<p>Checking in with the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Diablo IV’s latest expansion, Phasmophobia, Baldur’s Gate 3, and D&amp;D. Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> is very late to the party but he picked up Helldivers 2 the other day and sayd, “OH MY GOOD GRIEF WHAT A GAME! The most fun I’ve had with an online multiplayer in years. Helldivers 2 has shot it’s way straight into GOTY position for me!” So, I think he liked it.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <strong>Aran</strong> as he’s been suffering with illness this week – hope you get better soon mate! <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has continued with his standard dose of Destiny 2 and a little Beat Saber.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/the-smurfs-dreams-review/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> for review, both of which “were enjoyable in very different ways”. He continues, “I have got another highly anticipated horror game on the go for review next week so that’ll be my main focus. Other than that I have been polishing off the last few remaining Steam Next Fest demos and have put together a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">recommendation list</a>.”</p>


<p>Then we’re onto <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s week has almost exclusively been dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. He absolutely loved it, saying, “It’s my favourite COD since Black Ops 2 and manages to deliver on all fronts though the acrobatic omnidirectional movement takes some getting used to.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> snuck in a few matches of Black Ops 6 as well, but hasn’t started the campaign yet. Instead, this week he quickly checked out the spooky <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/lego-islands-mystery-of-the-monolith-wraps-up-with-lego-dark-space/">Lego Dark Space level in Fortnite</a>, got to share some thoughts about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/hands-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and put together a compare ’em up piece for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>This week saw the global launch of Pokemon TCG Pocket for Android and iOS devices, having been available in New Zealand for the last month. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today, following the global launch on October 30th, sees the first event that players can take part in outside of the standard missions. This event is Wonder Pick Event Part 1, with Chansey and Meowth being the focus. From today, and for the next two weeks, special promo card versions of Chansey and Meowth will appear in Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>
<p>Alongside the chance to get either the promo Chansey or Meowth, there are also new additions to the the Pokemon TCG Pocket shop, which are only available for the duration of the Wonder Pick Event Part 1. The three items available are a Meowth backdrop, a Meowth binder cover, and a pink desk frame to use for display boards. There are no new card sleeves, Pokemon flip coins, or playmats. The event items all cost 3 event shop tickets each.</p>
