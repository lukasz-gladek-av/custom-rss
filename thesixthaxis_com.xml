		<p>Nintendo’s reveal of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came with a big teaser for what will be easily the console’s biggest game: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-9">Mario Kart 9</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the short video that showed off the Switch 2’s hybrid design and how it’s been changed compared to the original Nintendo Switch, a Mario Kart game was running on the console’s screen in handheld mode, and when docked. Check it out:</p>

<p>There’s plenty of tidbits to dig out of this, most notably that this was a never-before-seen Mario Kart game, featuring a brand new circuit: Mario Bros. Circuit.</p>


<p>Mario Bros. Circuit takes us to a desert location with a proper race track design to it, though a track that quickly veers off the tarmac and onto the baked dirt of the desert, and eventually careening onto a multi-lane highway with traffic on it, where a Yoshi branded motoway-side diner or filling station could be seen as the camera pulled out to show a huge landscape, by Mario Kart standards.</p>

<p>We spotted a bunch of returning characters, taken from the regular cast of playable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters were driving a variety of different vehicles, including traditional kart/ATV styles, bikes, and a new tracked snowmobile for Rosalina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement</a> was pretty abstract outside of Mario Kart 9, showing lots of points of comparison how the console has changed from the original Switch design. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out in 2025, with Nintendo reconfirming that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Outside of that, details remain sparse, but given how Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has continued to sell and sell and sell, Nintendo has put its strongest foot forward already.</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct is planned for 2nd April 2025 which will no doubt showcase all of the launch games and give all the juicy launch details and pricing. In the meantime, we’ll have to go back to the rumour mill and speculation…</p>

		<p>After <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">a metric ton of rumours and reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been revealed, showing off the revised design of the hybrid console sequel and confirming a 2025 launch.</p>
<p>Watch the reveal trailer here, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">a Nintendo Direct for a full reveal set for 2nd April 2025</a>. In-person preview events are also planned and confirmed for major cities around the world from April through May… which would hint at a June launch, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>
<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated successor to the Switch has been heavily leaked over the past year or so, but it’s reached a fever pitch in the first few weeks of this year. Already being expected through 2023 and 2024, Nintendo took the unusual step of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">stating repeatedly that it will be announced before March 2025</a>, and clarifying before every stream that they would not be discussing it. Thankfully we can put all that behind us. Kind of. There’s still a lot of information to be confirmed by Nintendo about the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since then there’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer <a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit</a> (though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>
