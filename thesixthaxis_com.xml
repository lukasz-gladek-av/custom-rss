<p>Naevis is a virtual idol that began as a sidekick for the group Aespa, before being spun off to be a solo artist. Naevis’ has been confirmed as a real time commentator. It is worth mentioning that being a virtual idol means that Naevis is not a real person, and has been created using generative AI. The option to use Naevis as a real time commentator in Street Fighter 6 will also be available from July 4th.</p>

<p>In our Street Fighter 6 review, Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</p>
