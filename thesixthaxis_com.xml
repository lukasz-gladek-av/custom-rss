		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> “<em>Update: We are bringing Destiny 2 back online. Players may be placed into a queue while we continue our investigation,”</em> say Bungie</p>
<p><em>Original story follows…</em></p>


<p>The latest Episode of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Destiny 2</a> launched a few hours ago and players were immediately hit with server issues, some could not get into the game and those who could were being kicked from activities. As a result of the problems Bungie have decided to take the Destiny 2: Heresy offline.</p>
<p><em>“Update: As part of the investigation into today’s server and stability issue, we will be bringing Destiny 2 offline shortly for maintenance. Stand by for updates.” </em>reads a message on<a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">Twitter</a> posted at 7.40pm GMT.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are no longer using Twitter but find it annoying you can’t see Bungie’s tweets when this sort of thing is happening, then bookmark <a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">https://www.bungiehelp.org/&nbsp;</a>. It’s a fan-made site that harvests the Tweets for you so you don’t have to use Twitter.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: Heresy is the latest episode and finds Guardians heading back to the Leviathan with a new activity called The Nether which features rogue-like elements, for example health will no longer regenerate.</p>

<p>While you are waiting for the game to come back online, might as well take a gander at the patch notes, as usual they are massive.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p><strong>Episode Heresy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The final Episode for the year of Destiny 2: The Final Shape has begun.
<ul>
<li>Get in there, Guardians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crucible</h3>
<p><strong>Trials of Osiris</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rewards
<ul>
<li>Added new rewards, including an armor set, Ghost Shell, ship, Sparrow, and emblem.</li>
<li>No longer requires Flawless to earn most rewards.
<ul>
<li>Moved Trials away from a Flawless-based system to a “get seven wins on a card” system that rewards win streaks, with multiple tiers and exclusive aesthetic rewards for higher win streaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved the base reward structure of Trials.
<ul>
<li>Pinnacle Challenges now award Trials armor in addition to the Pinnacle gear.</li>
<li>Increased the amount of reputation gained on losses by 10x and added a new bonus that is earned by playing in a fireteam with clanmates.</li>
<li>Added a new set of base rewards for wins and losses that will be added to the existing Trios completion rewards, but for players in any fireteam configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passages – To help simplify the process, we have reduced the number of passages available to players from Saint-14 to two, one for each initial experience.
<ul>
<li>Lighthouse Passage
<ul>
<li>All you need to do is win seven games on a Lighthouse Passage and you will earn entrance to the Lighthouse, regardless of how many losses are on the card.</li>
<li>The Lighthouse Chest rewards are now broken up into two types:
<ul>
<li>Repeatable rewards that you can earn every time you complete a Lighthouse Passage and open the chest.</li>
<li>Weekly win streak rewards (from one to seven wins in a row), which can be earned once per week and must be true win streaks; there are no mercies here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trials Passage
<ul>
<li>We want to provide a separate place in Trials that is more like Iron Banner in terms of rewards and matchmaking to get additional players into the ecosystem.
<ul>
<li>Utilizes Weekly Performance-Based Matchmaking if everyone in your fireteam is on a Completed Lighthouse, Flawless, or Trials Passage.</li>
<li>Trials of Osiris Passage provides a healthy reputation bonus of 75 – 150 per win, depending on your current rank with Saint-14.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed how skill is tracked and updated for all modes.
<ul>
<li>Objectives are now on par with base kills for points.</li>
<li>Additional points are granted for kills that are in service to the objective.</li>
<li>Removed multiple “farmable” points like damage dealt, revives, and longest kill streak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Player Score Stat and Post Game Scoreboards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new stat called Player Score is displayed on our post-game scoreboards, which is a direct reflection of how many points you earned towards updating your skill rating in a game.</li>
<li>The post-game scoreboards of all modes now show Opponents Defeated and Combat Efficiency.</li>
<li>Added additional stats to the scoreboards of more modes, including Longest Chain (highest multi-kill medal) and Longest Streak.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Playlist Reorganization and Consolidation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This affects energy refunds from things like Gambler’s Dodge, Shiver Strike, and armor mods, but generally excludes Exotic effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a 10% cooldown penalty to Supers so that there is more of a tradeoff to picking these subclasses in modes where Super timing can be vitally important, like Trials or Competitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lobby Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have made some changes to the Paired Player lobby balancer so that it will fall back to the Average Lobby Rank balancer less often when dealing with fireteams.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Competitive Collision
<ul>
<li>New logic will prevent the next zone from spawning too near to the active zone.</li>
<li>Contesting a zone will now flip it to neutral so neither team gains points, as opposed to the current behavior where the team that owns the zone continues to accrue points while it is in the contested state.</li>
<li>The new zone will now show up 20 seconds before it opens, instead of 15 seconds, to give teams more time to move to the new area and contest the capture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zone Control
<ul>
<li>Decrease the frequency of Heavy ammo spawning to align it to regular Crucible modes like control at two minutes per spawn (120 seconds) from previously 60-second intervals.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Competitive</strong></p>

<li>The quit protection timer has been increased to 90 seconds, to make sure that if a player is&nbsp;AFK&nbsp;at the beginning of the match and gets kicked, their teammates will still benefit from the loss forgiveness.</li>
<li>Competitive Point System Rework
<ul>
<li>Removed the expected rank system entirely and streamlined the point gains and losses.
<ul>
<li>Wins and losses – Add or remove a base value of 100 points.</li>
<li>Performance bonus – Linked to Player Score and Efficiency, rewards between -10 and +10 points.</li>
<li>Contribution scalar – This system can grant a bonus of up to +50 to either reduce the points lost on defeat or grant additional points for a win, and will be utilized in two circumstances:
<ul>
<li>First, to help offset occurrences where some players contributed significantly more to the outcome of the game than others.</li>
<li>Second, it can also be applied as quitter compensation when a player has left earlier in the match, but the remaining players continue to finish it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skill Modifier – Based on the opposing team’s average skill compared to your team’s average skill. Capped at -20 to +20.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Khepri’s Horn
<ul>
<li>Now sends out three waves of flame instead of a single one when you cast your barricade.
<ul>
<li>These waves no longer return towards the barricade – they only travel outwards once.</li>
<li>Tracking on the waves has been enhanced.</li>
<li>Combatants damaged by these waves are enveloped in a Sunspot. Players are enveloped if they are defeated.</li>

<ul>
<li>Now uses a meter to track Death Throes. This means it decays down through the tiers rather than falling off completely when the duration expires.

<li>Branched the flinch taken so that they are no longer affected by the flinch nerfs targeted at Special ammo Linear Fusion Rifles in Crucible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rocket Sidearms
<ul>
<li>Intent is to make them slightly worse at add clear, harder to use at long range against moving targets and not as strong against bosses, but maintain the same total damage against a single target.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sumo Digital is stepping away from creating its own IP, making <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">a public statement</a> that it is now going to focus “exclusively on development services for partners.”</p>
<p>The statement justifies this by saying that they need to balance “creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business”. The goal is to become “a premium development partner”, something which is very much in keeping with a good portion of the company’s work to date.</p>


<p>At this time it’s not clear the extent of any associated job losses, though they state that “Unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people. We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care, and compassion.”</p>
<p>Sumo Digital has traditionally been known for their work on other publisher IPs, their most notable games including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/12/19/hands-on-sonic-sega-all-stars-racing/">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/18/littlebigplanet-3-review/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and pulling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/crackdown-3-review/">Crackdown 3</a> out of development hell, but starting with 2017’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/30/snake-pass-review/">Snake Pass</a>, they also sought to produce their own IP and branch out from work-for-hire and co-development contracts – even if these provided plenty of work, such as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/21/hitman-2-review/">Hitman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review/">Forza Horizon 4 &amp; 5</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won’t see the company winding down its Secret Mode publishing label, which has generally been the home for the company’s own IP productions, including last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/stampede-racing-royale-launches-for-free-with-a-dave-the-diver-collab/">Stampede: Racing Royale</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/deathsprint-66-is-a-buzzsaw-of-dystopian-future-racing/">DeathSprint ’66</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a> from subsidiary The Chinese Room. They’ve also been a broader indie publisher, though, with cute underwater adventure Loddlenaut, bike delivery game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>, and neat-and-tidy-’em-up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/11/a-little-to-the-left-review/">A Little to the Left</a>.</p>

<p>Sumo Digital was founded in 2003 in Sheffield, spending six years as a subsidiary to Foundation 9 Entertainment before regaining independence through a management buyout in 2014, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/">being acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The company has grown a huge amount in the last decade, and Sumo Group has grown to around 1,400 employees by 2023, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore. They’ve also further studios including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/14/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-devs-the-chinese-room-have-joined-sumo/">The Chinese Room</a>, Red Kit Games, Lab42, Atomhawk and more.</p>
<p>There’s uncertain times ahead, and hopefully the layoffs and disruption for such a large company – both in the UK and abroad – will be minimal.</p>
