            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The PS Plus Monthly Games selection for November 2025 has been revealed, which can be neatly summed up as being all about cats, cars and TABS.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus November 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 4th November:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stray</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports WRC</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>TABS</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>“Playing through the kitty cat adventure of Stray is an experience that’s filled with joy and delight,” Tuffcub said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/stray-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">review of Stray</a>. “I loved it, and so did my cat.”</p>
<p>To be fair, I’d expect that most people that wanted to play this game already have, as it launched in 2022 after a couple years of excited anticipation for cat loving gamers. It delivered on that vision in spades, and it’s easy to suggest you should catch up on this if you did skip it during sales in the last few years.</p>


<p>It sadly seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">rally racing is done and dusted at EA and Codemasters</a>, making EA Sports WRC the end of a long lineage of rallying that goes back through the DIRT series and Colin McRae. This was a pretty good effort to follow up on Dirt Rally 2.0, adding the official sport’s license into the mix. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC review</a>, Dom said, “If you’re looking for a fully featured and great handling rally game, EA Sports WRC is the undisputed champion this year, though PC players need to be aware that some technical bugs still need to be ironed out.”</p>

<p>And finally, there’s TABS, which stands for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. You can’t disagree with that name, as the game lets you take various different units and army formations and test them out against other armies and formations. It’s basically “who would win out of…”, but a video game, and there’s just sloshing buckets full of physics to make it all science-y.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Should you skip the Battlefield 6 campaign?]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign.1339009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first positive thing I heard about the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> campaign was that it throws up an “uninstall” button once you’ve watched the credits roll. On one hand it’s a genuinely helpful way to save some precious hard drive space, especially at such a release-heavy time of year, but given how divisive the reception has been towards this story-driven single player portion of the game, that button certainly has some emotions attached to it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 - Campaign Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZb3lPmxuSc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wouldn’t exactly call past Battlefield campaigns an afterthought, and there’s some real highlights from their varied efforts, though they are never the reason for the season. In the same way that I blitz through the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> campaigns before touching Zombies or multiplayer, I’ve traditionally done the same with Battlefield, knowing that the beating heart of these games rests within their brand of all-out, never-ending online warfare. Of course, when it came to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, there was no such option.</p>


<p>It’s hard to say whether a thrilling string of solo missions would have vastly improved EA and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/DICE">DICE</a>’s previous punt at their flagship FPS franchise, but even the barest offering could have helped flesh out its near future setting. In Battlefield 6 we’re immediately introduced to the game’s two warring factions: NATO and the private military corporation known as Pax Armata. While the two peacefully coexist for a time, Pax is on the rise as a growing coalition in its own right. 2027 Pax make their move and ambush unsuspecting NATO forces stationed in Georgia.</p>
<p>It’s the ultimate game of chicken. For the longest time NATO has gone unchallenged, and in its slow response to the sudden Pax threat, it loses credibility, with former allied nations now rallying under the protection of the ambitious PMC. What follows is an effort by NATO forces to retake territories and strongholds, spliced with cutscenes that probe into a deeper conspiracy of who is actually behind Pax.</p>


<p>There’s nothing all that gripping about the story. It succeeds in doing some basic stage-setting, giving players a pit stop tour of the various locations they’ll be blowing to smithereens in BF6’s multiplayer. While there has been a clear effort to weave in added layers of intrigue through the narrative’s framing, there isn’t much of a pay off – in fact, the game ends on an abrupt cliffhanger, just as things are starting to heat up and the conspiracy has begun to unravel.</p>
<p>One thing the campaign does get right is an emphasis on squad-based gameplay, even if it’s only lightly implemented as opposed to being a core feature. While you don’t get to directly control your fireteam, you can activate their class abilities to help turn a firefight in your favour, ordering them to deploy a smokescreen, scout enemy locations, or toss frag grenades. It’s a small touch, and one that’s very easy to completely ignore, yet it can lightly offset some of the repetition that comes from gunning down enemies at each checkpoint.</p>
<p>There is another staple Battlefield feature evident throughout the campaign: environmental destruction. It adds an extra strategic dimension to firefights, allowing players and NPCs to blast chunks out of walls in effort to flank enemies to hinder them as you retreat to safety, with plenty of stereotypically explosive barrels conveniently scattered through each location.</p>
<p>It isn’t all running and gunning. There are a handful of cinematic on-rails sections where you mount a machine on an armoured truck and one mission where you take control of a tank. These help add some variety, as do some of the gadgets you get to play with such as the tactical drone. However, given just how important vehicles are in multiplayer, it’s a shame we don’t get a campaign mission dedicated to fighter jets or helicopters. With no in-game tutorials explaining how to control these aircrafts, I’ve been in plenty of online matches where the sky hosts a flying circus of rookie pilots struggling to keep the sky above them and the ground below.</p>

<p>Clocking in at around 6 hours and spread across 9 missions, length isn’t really an issue for Battlefield 6’s single player. The problem is that, after investing all of that time, there are few memorable moments outside some technically impressive set pieces. Rather than being a satisfying conclusion to the story, the last cutscene feels more like the introduction to a final act that doesn’t exist. Unless EA and DICE decide to pick up where they left off in a sequel, of course.</p>
<p>To no-one’s surprise, the Battlefield 6 campaign isn’t an essential part of the overall package, but playing through these missions should give players more insight into the near future setting DICE has created and the motivations fuelling its two endlessly fighting factions.</p>

		<p>Monster Theater has announced that it has been working on update 2.0 for Atomic Owl, which it expects to release in November, and one of the major additions will be a No Roguelite mode. The main experience of Atomic Owl is that of a roguelite, where you replay stages and gain improvements to pass them. This new mode will bypass all that and assumedly make Atomic Owl a straightforward linear action game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Owl - Official Launch Trailer | Indie3 Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XhW86Kdn9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Monster Theater said, <em>“We have been toiling silently on a huge update to Atomic Owl! We found out pretty soon after release in July that we had to update our project to Unity 6, which caused a handful of animation issues, sequencing problems, and yada yada.&nbsp;&nbsp;It…was a pain. <wbr>Long story short…we did it and now we now have a potential candidate for Atomic Owl’s V2.0 release. Well, we wanted to address some repeating issues that we noticed players and reviewers weren’t fans of on launch.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>1.&nbsp;<b>No Roguelite Mode</b>&nbsp;that addresses the core concern from the game’s reviews regarding the game’s roguelite structure.</em><br>
<em>2. Huge UX and Background visibility improvements.</em><br>
<em>3. Voice acting volume slider.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>4. Pitfall improvements.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>5. NPC UX visibility improvements.&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>+ Bug fixes galore!</em></p>
<p><wbr><em>We are wrapping up all of the above fixes and submitting the 2.0 build, this Friday, October 31st.&nbsp;<wbr>The Planned release date for the V2.0 release of the game to drop on Steam sometime in November.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/atomic-owl-review/">Atomic Owl Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomic Owl review, I said, <em>“Atomic Owl is a satisfying roguelike with a simple progression that allows you to make headway quickly through the levels. This does come at the expense of the combat, which is a bit too on the easy side, with the platforming much more challenging than any boss fight. Overall though, if you want a short, simple, and good looking roguelike then Atomic Owl is worth a go.”</em></p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced the latest GameCube addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack’s</a> library of classic games, and with Halloween tomorrow, you’d better believe that it’s one of the company’s spookiest games: Luigi’s Mansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Luigi’s Mansion with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on Nintendo Switch 2!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5jceyKM83L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>That’s great and all, but where’s the GameCube’s scariest game? In the early 2000s, Nintendo was trying to pivot and capture a more mature audience, in the wake of the PS1 and PS2’s huge successes, and this came in a number of forms. Nintendo famously signed a major deal with Capcom, which led to the Resident Evil Remake, Resident Evil Zero and the groundbreaking Resident Evil 4. They’re great, and all, but they’re not the crowning jewel of horror gaming on GameCube, which has to be the Nintendo-published Eternal Darkness.</p>
<p>Silicon Knights’ game featured an innovative sanity meter that altered the game experience with sanity events that warped not just the game world, but broke the fourth wall in ways that have gone down in gaming lore.</p>

<p>But anyway, Luigi’s Mansion is great to have on Switch Online, and means that Switch 2 owners can play the full trilogy on one system – the GameCube original via Switch Online, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/">remaster of Luigi’s Mansion 2</a>, and then the excellent Switch native <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch/">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>. It’s a shame that we don’t have a native remake of this original game for Switch, given that it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/24/luigis-mansion-nintendo-3ds-review/">ported to the Nintendo 3DS back in the day</a>, but for the sake of gaming history, the original is better.</p>
