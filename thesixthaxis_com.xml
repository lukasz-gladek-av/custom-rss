		<p>WIth the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> next week on 6th February, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have released a new demo for the game, letting you explore early areas on both PS5 and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>The new demo will let players create their custom character and make a start on the game by exploring the Warring States period and battling through to the Jakotsu-baba boss, with save data able to carry over to the full game. This can all be played solo, of course, but there’s also support for up to three players in online multiplayer, so your buddies can come give you a hand.</p>


<p>Beating the demo by 15th February will then reward you with the Twin-Snake Helmet for the full version of the game – this bonus cannot be earned by those who’s already obtained it through the PS5 alpha demo, though.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 casts you as Tokugawa Takechiyo who has been forced from the shogunate throne by his rebellious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, and must face him and his army of demons in battle for the ages.</p>

<p>New for this game is a quick switch to a second combat style, transforming from Samurai to Ninja in a flash. You’ll make the most of these with the yokai that you battle in the new ‘open field’ setting that greatly broadens the level style.</p>

<p>I went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">hands on with Nioh 3 last year</a>, experiencing both this new combat style shifting and open field design. I said, “It’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.”</p>
