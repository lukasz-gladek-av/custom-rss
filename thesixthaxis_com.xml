		<p>Konami has announced that it will be hosting a stream on Thursday June 12th, called Konami Press Start, which will be air at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM BST/ 3:00 PM CEST. Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be present during the showcase, plus other announcements.</p>

<p>Konami are being pretty specific with the timing, stating the stream will last 37 minutes. So, we have two games confirmed for the showcase but they probably won’t take up the entire runtime. It is likely there will be some update regarding eFootball, possibly around the Club World Cup, since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/fifa-and-konami-sign-partnership-deal/">FIFA and Konami signed a partnership deal</a> back in October. That still leaves a vast library of IPs that Konami can draw on. People will likely be hoping for mention of a new Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid Collection Vol.2, mention of more Yu-Gi-Oh, and Bomberman. Maybe we’ll see some very dormant IPs turn up too like Zone of the Enders or Bloody Roar. It is likely the company will show something completely new too.</p>
<p>We will know exactly what Konami has up its sleeve in just a few days time.</p>
