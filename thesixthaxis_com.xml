		<p>“The story of killing Nazis is evergreen,” is the somewhat eyebrow-raising tag line for Amazon MGM’s next video game adaptation, Wolfenstein. Patrick Somerville, writer of the excellent The Leftovers, will be rather busy as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.&nbsp; Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will also be on hand as Executive Producers. although that title is rather honorific and does not necessarily mean they will have input.</p>
<p>This is not the first time someone has tried to adapt the franchise, in 2012, movie producer&nbsp;Samuel Hadida announced a film based on the games&nbsp;with&nbsp;Roger Avary, writer of Pulp Fiction, attached to write and direct.</p>


<p>No other details of the Wolfenstein TV show have been revealed but most games have featured William “B.J.” Blazkowicz, an American soldier who encounters Nazi’s dabbling in the occult. The first game was released… prepare to feel very old… forty-five years ago, in 1981.&nbsp; Since then, there have been thirteen games, with the most recent, 2019’s Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, being a spin-off set a week before the previous game, Wolfenstein:&nbsp; Youngblood.</p>
<p>Sadly that game did not live up to expectations and we gave <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/29/wolfenstein-youngblood-review/">it 6/10 in our review</a>, which was summed up with “Go home Wolfenstein, you’re drunk.”</p>
