		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that BlizzCon will be back in 2026, with the weekend of September 12th and September 13th selected as the date of its return. It will be taking place in Anaheim, California. BlizzCon did not take place in 2024, and nor will it take place this year either. Obviously, it is a bit too far out to speculate on what to expect but World of Warcraft will likely be a central focus.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said, <em>“One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together. We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.”</em></p>
