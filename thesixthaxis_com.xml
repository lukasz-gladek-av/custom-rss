		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>

<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

		<p>Bugbear has released Content Update 3 for their smashtastic racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, adding two new cars, nine new tracks and/or layouts, better AI and plenty more improvements across the Early Access game.</p>
<p>There’s also been fresh teasers of the single player campaign, modding support and more features that will be added, but for now the focus has been on fleshing out and optimising the core content of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #03" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDq8IFt87p8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The two new cars are the Switchback American muscle car, and the Popper European “folk racing” car. You can race them both around the Cannonhill and Savolax tracks (in both directions), while there’s new layouts for the Scrapyard Speedbowl, Figure 8 and Main Circuit, a small oval at Speedway, and the Rallycross 1 circuit can be run in reverse.</p>
<p>More broadly, AI difficulty can now be set to novice, amateur and expert, there’s improved online multiplayer latency, support for telemetry for SimHub and generic systems, and plenty more.</p>
