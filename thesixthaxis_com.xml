		<p>Nacon and Cyanide Studios have revealed Styx: Blades of Greed, a new sequel in the sneaky goblin stealth action series. The game is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in autumn 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="(PEGI) Styx: Blades of Greed | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRb9E2ULlEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A third game in the Styx series, the titular goblin assassin is returning eight years after his last stealthy self-serving mission in Styx: Shards of Darkness. Where it was all about infiltrating a “good” guy fort to access their boundless supply of Amber last time out, Styx is now after the new mystical powers provided by quartz.</p>
<p>Through the announcement trailer we see him putting this to use, in combination with returning abilities and gadgets. With the inquisition hunting for him, he can use a little mind control to turn allies against each other, use environmental objects for kills, place poison gas bomb traps for guards to trigger, and slow enemies down to make for a hasty escape. Naturally, Styx is quipping and grouching all the way throughout.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this game has advanced over the first two entries. They were both dependable, if fairly straightforward stealth action games that admittedly didn’t quite have the depth and nuance that you’d hope for from the PS4 and Xbox One era of games. With a jump to a newer game engine and the current generation of consoles, I hope that there’s also an increase in gameplay quality, and not just a spruce up of the visuals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review/">Looking back at the last game</a>, I said, “Shards of Darkness could have been a big step forward for the series, giving you a more rounded set of gameplay possibilities, alongside the better looking environments and other areas. Alas it’s not as big an improvement as I’d hoped and is let down by bugs and inconsistencies. It’s a stealth game with one foot stuck in the past, and that remains both a blessing and a curse.”</p>

		<p>Nacon and ACE Team, the makes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/27/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-review/">Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</a> and Zeno Clash, have revealed The Mount: Omen of Cthulhu, a first person horror with up to four player online co-op. The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tD4pvmQPETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cast as a squad of conquistadors exploring an underound city in an eerie jungle setting, your search for priceless treasure becomes a fight for survival as otherworldly, Lovecraftian horrors distort your senses and threaten your sanity. Sounds could be from your mind playing tricks, you could hallucinate an ally as an enemy creature, and more. You’ll have to try and work as a team to get deeper and deeper into the jungle and somehow make it out alive.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re horribly under-equipped to deal with this kind of terror. Instead of having the machine guns and flamethrowers that you might want, you have to make do with swords, lanterns, axes and muskets. You will have voice chat to your fellow conquistadors, at least.</p>
<p>It’s a big change of pace for ACE Team, whose most recent work was a Zeno Clash revival in Clash: Artifacts of Chaos. That game was all about third person brawling, by way of the Soulslike genre, and coming with a fantastic art style. Before that, the team released a trio of Rock of Ages ball-tumbling puzzlers, and the thoroughly bizarre survival game Eternal Cylinder.</p>

<p>What seems to be a straight-up four person survival horror game might just be their most conventional game yet, but we’re looking forward to seeing the individualistic spin they will inevitably put on proceedings. the snippets of alpha gameplay footage at the end of the trailer certainly backed up the twisted, shifting nature of the slickly produced cinematic that preceded it.</p>
<p>Definitely one to keep an eye on for fans of recent co-op horrors like Phasmophobia, The Outlast Trials, and Lethal Company.</p>

		<p>The first gaming accessory from Nacon’s Racing department, the Revosim RS Pure, will launch in June 2025 and is now available for pre-order.</p>
<p><iframe title="REVOSIM | Live-Action Pre-Order Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NmDUzo6pXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/31/nacon-announces-new-revosim-direct-drive-racing-wheels/">Announced last May</a>, the Revosim RS Pure is a 9Nm Direct Drive gaming wheel, meeting the core technological standards and expectations of what a high-end racing wheel should provide. Along with the motor, the wheel itself then features imitation leather, and there’s aluminium pedals to get a premium, high-end finish. There’s also a built-in smartphone mount to allow for app connected telemetry and a heads up display.</p>
<p>The RS Pure is the first piece of the puzzle for a broader Revosim line up, getting the foundational wheel and pedals set released first before additional peripherals arrive, which will include a handbrake, gear shifter and clutch pedal. The wheel is compatible with Windows PC only.</p>
<p>The wheel will have <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/bundle-steering-wheel-base-dd-9nm-pedal-rs-pure">support for the following games at launch</a>, with app telemetry support “in development” across the board</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/accessories/revosim">Preorders are now live</a> with the full package of wheelbase, wheel and pedals coming in at €799.90. The wheelbase can be had separately for €550, wheel for €200, wheelbase and wheel for €700, and pedals for €150 – I trust that you can all mentally subtract 10 cents from each price there.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/hands-on-the-revosim-pure-nacons-first-high-end-racing-wheel/">hands on with the Revosim RS Pure at Gamescom 2024</a>, saying that “Fundamentally, the Revosim Pure just seems to be a nice all-round basis for Nacon to build out their racing wheel range from, and a solid alternative to the big names already in the racing wheel market.”</p>

		<p>The first gameplay for French-created JRPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/teg/edge-of-memories">Edge of Memories</a> has been revealed in a new trailer during Nacon Connect. This sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/edge-of-eternity">Edge of Eternity</a> is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC towards the end of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories | Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0TiQvWIuj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midgar Studios hopes to bring players back to the land of Heryon in Edge of Memories, building on the foundations of their first JRPG effort. there’s a new evil threatening this world and players will have to take Eline and her companions on a fresh adventure to try and defeat it. A powerful Corrosion i</p>
<p>The story synopsis tells us, “The beautiful, serene landscapes of Avaris are under the threat of a powerful corrupting influence, Corrosion, as it spreads across the land. Mutating anything in its path into horrific abominations. As a Soul Whisperer, it’s your job to travel the world, easing the people of their burdens, and fighting back against the monsters inhabiting the world. During her journey, Eline awakens to a mysterious power that may hold the answer to thwarting the oncoming apocalypse.” Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>Edge of Memories will remain an action-RPG, with fast-paced real-time combat and eye-popping combo attacks. It’s also looking to build on the original artistically. If Edge of Eternity felt like a Final Fantasy game with its art direction, Edge of Memories looks to be more like recent Tales games. This is thanks to collaborating with a host of established creators including character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles X), while the rest of the team includes writer Sawako Natori (NieR), singer Emi Evans (NieR / NieR: Automata), as well as composers Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger/ Xenogears) and Mariam Abounnasr (Xenoblade Chronicles 3 / ONINAKI).</p>

<p>The original Edge of Eternity launched in 2021, and went on to sell over a million copies, making a follow-up something of a no-brainer. Despite its JRPG trappings, and the various members of the team that hail from there, Midgar Studios is actually based in France, and they’re returning once more for Edge of Memories.</p>
<p>Looking back on the original, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/edge-of-eternity-review/">review</a> for Edge of Eternity, Steve wrote: “Edge of Eternity is definitely a welcome addition to the JRPG pantheon, and while it clearly doesn’t have the budget of the genre giants, it is full of heart and character. I certainly enjoyed my time exploring Heryon, despite a few niggles and a crafting system that adds little. If you go into this with an open mind and have an affection for the genre, then you’ll find much to like.”</p>
