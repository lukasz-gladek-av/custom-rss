<p>In our ARC Raiders article, Stefan pondered whether the game could be for everyone, and said, <em>“ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.”</em></p>
