		<p>Following on from last month’s reveal, 3D Realms and Saber Interactive have released a brand new trailer for Painkiller with this one focusing specifically on weapons. The trailer confirms there are seven weapons in total for players to use including the Stakegun, Electrodriver, SMG, Handcannon, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and of course the titular Painkiller.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J41CouSSWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Stakegun impales foes with with high damage stakes, the Electrodriver fires off shurikens that will bounce off surfaces, the SMG fires lots of bullets in bursts, the Shotgun will deal high damage close up and staggers foes, the Handcannon hits hard from distance, the Rocket Launcher takes out groups, and the Painkiller hooks on to enemies and shreds them up.&nbsp; All of the weapons will have primary and alternative fire modes along with upgrades with bonuses, and elemental rounds including &nbsp;fire, ice, electro and kinetic.</p>
<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven. The way to redeem yourself is by blasting away the demons of purgatory in an attempt to stop the fallen angel Azazel’s invasion of Earth. Painkiller can be playable solo and will also support co-op for up to three players. Painkiller is due to release this autumn for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
