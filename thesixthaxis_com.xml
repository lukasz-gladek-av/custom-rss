		<p>The first DLC expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> will launch on 17th July, bringing Fantasy Finds into the exhibit halls with magical artefacts, class-based Fantasy Experts and a whole new realm for you to send them adventuring across.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | Coming 17th July" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fantasy Finds will add 40 new exhibits to discover, from the Teanie Kettle and Novel Wardrobe through to a Flying Carpet or a Mimic chest. With such wondrous magical marvels to behold, guests can easily get wrapped up in the action and become cursed, if you don’t maintain them properly.</p>
<p>That’s where Fantasy Experts come in, with Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue and Bard classes, each of which comes with specific stats. When sending them out on expeditions, you’ll have to juggle whether they’ve got enough Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Luck to overcome the challenges that await them, adding a little something extra to the expeditions found in the main game.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t do to just plop down your magic carpet in the middle of a boring hall. There’s 26 new decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, and floors to get the vibes just right for the three new guest archetypes that you’ll want to entertain. You can also buff museum staff with Mythical Gear to provide bonuses for protecting exhibits and giving a little more job security.</p>

<p>In the run up to the DLC release, Two Point Museum is 20% off in the Steam Summer Sale, while the DLC will have a 10% discount across PC, Xbox and PlayStation for its first week on sale.</p>
<p>Launching earlier this year, Two Point Museum is another great spin on the humorous management sim series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">I said in our review</a>, “There’s great strides to allow for more customisation and creativity, a revamped structure to make revisiting levels more rewarding, and great variety in the core disciplines, but there’s also a few snags along the way and elements that could improved through updates and DLC.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Featured as part of the Capcom Spotlight stream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has some big updates coming soon. Free Title Update 2 launches next week on 30th June, bringing back Lagiacrus and Seregios, and plenty more besides!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJQFAfT0T3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The long-awaited return of Lagiacrus brought an interesting challenge for Capcom, the Monster Hunter Tri star having introduced water battles back in the day. For this reappearance in Monster Hunter Wilds, underwater battles will return, but will be an additive to the surface combat and have some special moves, like the grapple, to help getting in close to deal damage.</p>
<p>Seregios then appeared in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, the version of the game that had an international release. As an agile monster that came with a then surprising diagonal kick and speed, these properties have been retained for the Wilds update.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Monster Hutner Wilds Title Update 2 brings new weapon layering – you just need to have crafted the final weapon in the tree, hit the final level for Artian weapons, or high ranked for Palico weapons, and this will give more customisation options.</p>

<p>Photo mode is being enhanced with the ability to hide characters, youll be able to swap Erik in for Alma as you handler, and there’s a new support unit with Mina, a sword and shield user from Vespae Unit.</p>

<p>The summer roadmap for MH Wilds is also stacked. From 23rd July there will be the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, bringing a new look to Grand Hub, and with a bunch of new rewards.</p>
<p>Arch-Tempered Uth Dura will then appear on 30th July, this limited time creature offering new armour sets for those who can overcome its HR 50+ event quest and challenge.</p>
<p>Oh, and then at the end of August? Yeah, then you can grab a Fender and start shredding. This barmy real-world collab is feeding back into the game with a limited event that rewards players with a guitar. You’ll get a rendition of the guitar which has been scanned in with photogrammetry, touched up with scuffs and scratches, and which has then been brought into the game alongside custom motion captured animations, music recorded on this actual guitar, and just a huge attention to detail. Heck, even palicos will start to jump around an air guitar when you use this emote gesture!</p>
<p>Released earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds was the long-awaited successor to Monster Hunter Worlds, arriving from the off for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">our review</a>, “Monster Hunter Wilds is the best Monster Hunter game we’ve ever had. The best storyline, the best visuals, and changes to the combat that revolutionise the way the game plays. That said, striving for the widest audience yet has dulled some of the series difficulty, and you may have to wait for the toughest parts of Wilds to fully reveal themselves.”</p>
