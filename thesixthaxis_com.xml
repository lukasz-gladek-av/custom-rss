		<p>Pathea Games has announced that the alpha playtest for My Time At Evershine will begin on October 24th, and it will be for those who pledged $35 or more to the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam PC version of the game. Steam keys are going to be going out on October 21st and redeemable through PledgeManager, with My Time At Evershine then being available to download on October 24th. The key that is being sent out is not for the full game, as a separate key for that will be sent when the game is ready to release.</p>

<p>Those who have backed My Time At Evershine on Kickstarter but chose a console version are not eligible for the alpha playtest. However, that can be changed by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fill out the&nbsp;<b>[<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FM4qmMVsc6uVHAw1TA">Google Form here</a>]</b>&nbsp;to register your request. &nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>If you already selected Steam (PC) previously, you don’t need to fill out this form – unless you now want to switch from&nbsp;<b>Steam</b>&nbsp;(PC) to&nbsp;<b>console</b>&nbsp;instead.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>We’ll collect all responses and upload them to PledgeManager.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Once processed, you’ll receive a new invitation email to reopen your PledgeManager survey and select Steam. If you can’t find the invitation email, simply log back into PledgeManager to check your survey.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>The deadline for this first batch of console-to-PC requests is&nbsp;<b>October 22nd, 18:00 (UTC+8)</b>. That’s&nbsp;<b>03:00 AM PST / 06:00 AM EST / 12:00 PM CET.</b><wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Please double-check your selection when switching to Steam. Once your Steam key is assigned, your&nbsp;<b>Alpha platform</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<b>locked</b>&nbsp;and cannot be changed again.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>This round only covers&nbsp;<b>console-to-Steam switches for Alpha access.</b>&nbsp;Other cases – like switching between consoles or standard PC (non-Alpha) keys – will be handled later.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first round of keys being sent out for the My Time At Evershine alpha playtest, with this running until the game is released properly. If you do get into the playtest you will not be allowed to share any images, videos or thoughts about My Time At Evershine outside of the Pathea Games official channels.</p>

		<p>Marvel has announced the first ever PvE mode for its free to play hero shooter Marvel Rivals, with this crossover being suitably in season. From October 23rd, a new Zombies mode inspired by Marvel Zombies will be released for Marvel Rivals, allowing players to team up and take on hordes of the undead until they become overwhelmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="First-Ever PvE Mode: Marvel Zombies I Announce Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xBptgEhiok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There are some limits to the Marvel Rivals Zombie mode such as the playable characters. Players will only be able to play as Thor, Jeff, Magik, The Punisher, or Blade. Eventually, after the hordes get dealt with you will face off against bosses Zombie Namor and The Queen of the Dead. Each playable hero will have a unique ability to deal with the zombie waves. Jeff will be able to charge through groups, Blade will be armed with a bouncing Moon Blade, Thor will be able to shock zombies in his Awakened state, and Magik has an unlimited Darkchild form.</p>

Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor).</p>

		<p>It’s been a while since we heard a peep out of Quantic Dream. While they’re now publishing titles, as well as developing their own, most people are waiting on tenterhooks for more news about Star Wars Eclipse, the game they’re working on for Lucasfilm/Disney. However, they’ve clearly got time to work on other things as well, with today’s announcement of Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play, 3v3 online multiplayer title.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmI8nzNHR8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the reveal trailer, Spellcasters Chronicles has plenty going for it. It looks like it merges MOBA-style gameplay with a more direct, third-person viewpoint, and it’s definitely looking the part, utilising an anime-inspired art style to bring its world to life. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, and the fact that it’s free-to-play will mean there’s very little reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>“We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios,” said David Cage, Founder and President of Quantic Dream. “Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players’ feedback and to perfecting this journey together.</p>
<p>This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative. It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars Eclipse.”</p>


<p>If this sounds like your sort of thing, there’s a closed beta coming up that you can sign up for now, with dates due to be announced soon. You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/beta">https://www.SpellcastersChronicles.com/beta</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-gets-a-brand-new-trailer-in-the-run-up-to-twitchcon/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re into anime, chances are you’ve watched Solo Levelling. It’s been one of the best shows of recent years – albeit one that’s a massive power fantasy, but then, aren’t they all? One of the most anticipated RPGs of next year, Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive, looks to bring that power fantasy to life in stellar fashion, and publisher Netmarble will certainly be pinning a lot of their hopes on its success. Things are definitely looking good though, and in preparation for the game’s appearance at TwtichCon San Diego in the US, the developers have dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some of the game’s combat features.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. What’s great about the series is that he spends the first couple of series hiding these newfound abilities, but there’s definitely the sensation that things might take a turn for the worse in the near future, as he gets more and more powerful.</p>
<p>There’s lots of levelling up and fighting off fantastical creatures in Solo Levelling, so it’s little surprise to see Arise Overdrive focusing on that. As it’s a series based on the idea of a world that’s being experienced like a video game, it’s a perfect match, and one which I can see Netmarble doing a good job with. Combat looks swift and flashy, and there’s definitely some similarities to be found with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XVI, taking on huge creatures with melee weaponry and visually impressive special moves. </p>


<p>Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive is due to launch on November the 17th for PC via Steam and Xbox Series consoles. If you fancy checking the game out before that at Twitchcon San Diego, that’s going to run over this weekend, from the 17th to the 19th of October. </p>
