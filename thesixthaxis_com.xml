		<p>It’s one of the biggest Februaries of games that I can remember, with a clutch of major RPGs and one of the most-anticipated 4X games in almost a decade now in our hands. All of that is set to be eclipsed at the end of the month by Monster Hunter Wilds, but could you imagine if Assassin’s Creed Shadows hadn’t been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">nudged back to March</a>?</p>
