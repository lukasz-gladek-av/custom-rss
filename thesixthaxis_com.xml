		<p>Housemarque has revealed Saros, their next new IP and an evolution of the time looping shooter action that was last seen in their PS5 debut <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>. Saros is in development for PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, and it’s coming out in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending poor Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony.</p>
<p>Saros will feature a permanent progression system where death reshapes the world and gives you new upgrade possibilities to defeat the challenges you face. That’s a wordy way of saying it’s going to be a roguelike.</p>
<p>It’s also confirmed that it will be another third-person action game, again looking to evolve the gameplay from Returnal.</p>

<p>Gameplay will be revealed in due course, but we’re immediately rather excited for this one!</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/darwins-paradox-is-a-gorgeous-side-scrolling-octopus-adventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Konami and developer ZDT have revealed Darwin’s Paradox, a side-scrolling platformer adventure with an abducted octopus as its star. The game has been confirmed for PS5, coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin's Paradox! - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbgsjUFIBOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game looks like it draw influences from other platformer adventures of the last decade, such as Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, or Tarsier’s Little Nightmares, but gives it a more humorous, lighter tone thanks to much more colourful grahpics, a 1950s sci-fi style and animation in keeping with modern movies.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/darwins-paradox-makes-a-splash-onto-ps5/">PS Blog</a>, the team explain:</p>
<p>Our protagonist Darwin has all the evolutionary features of an octopus including the ability to climb almost any surface, camouflage himself, and also the skill to shoot ink to evade his enemies. Haptic feedback on the DualSense controller’s triggers will give you the satisfying feeling of firing off multiple shots of black ink to hit hard-to-reach levers and buttons, or to blind security camera feeds to plan your escape. When swimming in underwater scenarios, the ink shot disperses into the water, creating a perfect back smokescreen to help you get past searchlights without being spotted – just like octopi do in the real world when they feel threatened by a predator in the wild.</p>

<p>Keeping a close eye on your environment is key if you want to survive. As a typical octopus is known to do, Darwin can also morph his skin to match the spot he’s in – essentially creating camouflage to hide and avoid detection.</p>
<p>Darwin’s movements across the world are meticulously tracked with controller vibrations, giving you a sense of connection to our curious cephalopod everywhere he climbs. When you get hit, you feel it.&nbsp; In a world as dangerous as the one Darwin dares to explore, there will be short-circuit shocks, crushing machines of twisted metal, and roaming packs of rabid rats looking to make Darwin a tasty meal.</p>
<p>Certainly one to keep an eye on, if you ask me!</p>

		<p>Having announced Onimusha: Way of the Sword back in December with a teaser trailer, Capcom has turned up for the State of Play stream with the first real trailer for the classic franchise revival, showcasing the game’s protagonist: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 1st Trailer: Protagonist | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Ct29FeMak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set for launch sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay, featuring its “Issen” counterattack mechanics.</p>
<p>Way of the Sword takes us to Kyoto in the Edo period where the relative peace of this period has been broken by &nbsp;the infestation by the demonic Genma, transforming it into na eerie and unsettling place. A long samurai with the Oni Gauntlet will have to step into the darkness and battle the hellish enemies.</p>

<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though, and Capcom has also recently confirmed a remaster of Onimusha 2, coming out on 23rd May.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - Pre-Order Announcement Trailer&nbsp;| PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jZVwlMhAPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

<p>“Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. 12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>
<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror </strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats </strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>

Speed to victory solo or as a team in a variety of offline and online modes and compete against players from around the world.

<p>The trailer mentions a closed network test on February 21st, but the <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official site </a>does not have anyway to sign up just yet. </p>

		<p>Sega shared a new trailer for their classic side-scrolling ninja series Shinobi. Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is coming out on 29th August for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ge__8Dan6bU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After rumours that Joe Musashi might appear in Lizardcube’s last big retro revival, Streets of Rage 4, the team has instead been given control of the series return instead.</p>
<p>“Play as Joe Musashi in a new 2D action platformer that marks the return of the iconic SHINOBI franchise,” reads the trailer blurb. “Battle challenging enemies and epic bosses in a uniquely hand-drawn world.”</p>
<p>It’s looking pretty tasty. We’ll share more details when we have them.</p>
