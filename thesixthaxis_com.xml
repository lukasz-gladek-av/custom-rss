		<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating melting pot of ideas, both novel and new, and borrowed from other games, movies and anime. It’s one of those games that feels almost impossibly ambitious, Dreamlit inc. crafting a truly gorgeous game world that you’ll shape as you fill it with life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba: Early Access Gameplay Showcase + Release Date Announcement!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Cm-02rxXdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will take you to the desolate landscapes of Aghasba, a region that was once home to huge amounts of vibrant life, both in nature and with the Shimu people settled there. That civilisation and the balance of ecosystems was torn apart by the Withered, forcing the Shimu to flee. Now you, as a junior architect for your people, are returning to restore Aghasba to something of its former glory.</p>


<p>Dreamlit inc. CEO and game director Khang Lee is refreshingly open about how he came to the core concept of Towers of Aghasba, and how it’s morphed over time. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, and the films <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)">Labyrinth</a> were all amongst the early inspirations for this game – essentially, looking to harness the creativity of Minecraft within a much prettier art style and world – and Towers of Aghasba actually started out as a 2D side scrolling game. But then came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> to push the studio’s ambitions further – you can see it in the free climbing and glider – and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-cross-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> to refocus the game in a different direction. What was a survival game in 2019 has had some of the edges of that genre sanded back to morph into more of a building and exploration game.</p>


<p>You’ll naturally need to start off small as you plant your first Colossal Tree – it starts off relatively small, but will grow to live up to its name over time – a life-giving tree that will instantly spread grasses and other plant life in the immediate surrounding area. It will define the biome of the region, bring creatures back to the area and create a little pocket of vibrant life for you to live in. There’s some really fantastical creature designs here, that blend the familiar with utterly alien.</p>
<p>It will also provide the foundation for a lot of the general activities you’ll be doing, giving you the opportunities to hunt, to fish, to feed the animals and more. One point of emphasis here compared to other survival and builder games is that you will likely want to try and be sustainable in how you do this, ensuring the the ecosystem can continue to thrive alongside your actions.</p>

<p>In parallel to the local ecology, you’ll also look to rebuild villages for the Shimu. You’ll come across the ruins from before the Withered forced your people away, and have to rebuild structure-by-structure. You’ll need to find and harvest the minerals to build the structures, and then use them to foster things like farming, production and more.</p>
<p>Helping to guide you is the world’s lore and a menagerie of characters and ancient gods that you’ll meet along the way. They’ll explore some of the backstory of the world, helping you figure out what happened to the island, giving you quests and missions to follow along the way. It’s really more about onboarding you and nudging you along the way to restore the island in your own way.</p>

<p>And that will mean fighting to push back the Withered and unlock new areas that you can restore. Still filled with a poisonous atmosphere and more horrific creatures, you’ll have to battle against towering monsters to loosen the Withered’s grip on the region.</p>
<p>Your time within the Withered will be limited, every second that you spend within these dark places seeing an inky black miasma bubbling around you, slowly poisoning you over time. The survival aspects of Towers of Aghasba won’t extend to needing food to satiate your hunger –&nbsp;it’s more casual in that regard –&nbsp;but as you step into the Withered, you’ll need to have crafted potions to help build a resistance to the atmosphere, armour to defend against the monsters and soldiers you face, and weapons to help you fight back.</p>
<p>Thankfully you won’t have to go alone. You can play in groups of up to four, inviting friends to your personal island, trading with them, and heading in to fight back the Withered together.</p>

<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating endeavour that looks to strike an intriguing balance and blend between its various inspirations. It’s a lovely looking game, with an impressive scale and ambition to let you shape it as you please.</p>
<p>Thankfully it won’t be too long before we can try it for ourselves. Towers of Aghasba will launch into Early Access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 19th November, a little less than a month from now.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/yooka-laylee-remake-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-platforms/</link>

		<p>The firmly current gen remake of Yooka-Laylee – cutely dubbed Yooka-Replaylee – has been confirmed for release on consoles, with Playtonic targeting PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and “Nintendo platforms”, which surely means Nintendo Switch 2 and not the current console, or they’d just say it was for Switch. The game is also coming to PC, as previously confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Console Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGfmssnKf1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’re in a very curious spot for remakes and remasters right now, with Yooka-Replaylee a remake of a game that’s just shy of 10 years old. The game was the debut title for Playtonic Games, who<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/01/the-banjo-kazooie-spiritual-successor-is-called-yooka-laylee/"> kickstarted the project back in 2015</a>, eventually releasing &nbsp;it in 2017.</p>
<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a> to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p>It does look rather pretty, I must say, though I’d hope this is a stepping stone to a full 3D platformer sequel, if it proves to be popular enough. There was also the side-scrolling spin off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>.</p>

<p>The spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee was a love letter to the early heyday of the collectathon 3D platformer. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

		<p>Nightdive Studios has shared a gameplay trailer for their latest retro remaster, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-thing">The Thing: Remastered</a>. The remaster of the 2002 psychological action horror is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: Remastered Gameplay Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXaWScbsF6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the more modern games that Nightdive is remastering, the team is able to bring some of the biggest visual upgrades to The Thing yet. There will be improved models, textures and environments, but there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>The team has also worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. It will be interesting to see if any of that has been adapted as well.</p>
<p>While fear and suspicion are core to the experience, there’s also a lot of action, fighting against horrific monstrosities that The Thing has morphed into.</p>

<p>2002’s The Thing is as close as we’ll (hopefully) get to a sequel to the best film ever made – not an opinion, just a fact. Speaking of facts, John Carpenter endorsed this game as a continuation of his movie, with various story beats that remain dangling at the end. Sadly, Computer Artworks never got the opportunity for a sequel to their game, despite the largely positive reception. It’s great to see their legacy continue with this remaster.</p>

		<p>The tradition of horror gaming through October has been something that’s largely passed me by, but I’ve indulged a little this year. My gaming this past week has featured non-horror stalwarts like Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (unless you consider retro mid-90s FPS graphics to be horror), but I’ve also continued on with my playthrough of Until Dawn, rather appreciating its episodic structure for concise play sessions. There’s also been a little bit of Phasmo in my life, as I try to make head or tail of how the ghost hunting game works.</p>

<p>Joining me for some ghost hunting shenanigans (and similarly perplexed by how uncooperative each spectre is to be figured out) were <strong>Nic B</strong> and <strong>Gamoc</strong>. Nic complemented that with some more Metaphor ReFantazio (as a palate cleanser from Unknown 9 last week), while Gamoc wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a>, had a great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/vendetta-forever-review/">Vendetta Forever</a>, and a little bit of Baldur’s Gate 3 and some real world D&amp;D, where he was “basically a werewolf”.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy XVI and will be grabbing the DLC soon before he heads off to do the final boss fight – as a nice bonus, that will be a bit cheaper because he discovered some PlayStation Stars points.</p>
<p>Ade’s been playing the “delightfully ridiculous and bombastic” EDF 6, alongside some Metroid Dread. He’s pretty close to the end of Dread, which is just a little bit shy of Metroid Fusion’s greatness – a stone cold classic, is Fusion.</p>


<p>Heading off to the frontiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/new-world-aeternum-mmo-relaunch-makes-strong-first-impression/">New World: Aeternum</a>, <strong>Jim</strong> has enjoyed his time with Amazon’s revamped MMO, now that it’s on console – “I’ve had the itch to play an MMORPG for some time now though the options haven’t been all that inviting. I’ve heard good things about the latest expansions for World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and Final Fantasy XIV but I wanted to try something a little different and more accessible. New World fit the bill perfectly, and was all the more appealing thanks to its one-time purchase instead of adopting a monthly recurring subscription.”</p>
<p>He’s also got emulators up and running on his Steam Deck for the PS2 nostalgia of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, while the weekend ahead will feature plenty of Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who’s play the surprise retro horror of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/tormenture-review-retro-scares/">Tormenture</a>, the surprisingly enjoyable The Smurfs – Dreams, and Nikoderiko. He also had the chance to play through the Shadows of the Damned Hella Remastered. Keep an eye out for reviews soon!.</p>
