			<p>Fast Fusion was my first Switch 2 game. While I had Mario Kart World waiting in the wings, it was this indie racer, available at launch for a bargain price, that was my first choice for the brand new Nintendo system. You might be wondering if I’ve lost all my marbles, but if you’re a Nintendo fan, you’ll know that this is a racing series that’s consistently delivered an experience far beyond its indie trappings. We’re not getting a new F-Zero or Wipeout, but with Fast Fusion, you likely won’t care.</p>

<p>Anti-grav racing is hardly new – Wipeout first appeared on the PlayStation in 1995, and F-Zero on the SNES in 1990 – but time, or licenses, seem to have dwindled in recent years for a futuristic sub-genre that used to sit on the cutting edge of tech. The Fast series began life on the Wii with Fast Racing League, appearing on the Wii U with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/16/fast-racing-neo-review/">Fast Racing Neo</a> and then an enhanced version on the original Switch with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a>. Each time, developers Shin’en Multimedia found a way to make the hardware sing, producing games that looked like AAA racers on indie budgets, and keeping a genre alive to boot.</p>


<p>Fast Fusion looks like a true current gen racing title, fit for your PS5 or Xbox Series X. The different tracks in particular look stunning, with the sweeping views as you load into a race showcasing the detail and depth of each intergalactic locale. While each track is tied together by industrial sections of gleaming metal, the different landscapes shift between the traditional vision of the future with its towering structures of metal and glass and more naturalistic luscious forests, each track also bringing different hazards to bear on the racers as well. The incremental details are just amazing, from Sand Whales leaping out of the desert, to the Ewok-esque tree hazards in the forest</p>
<p>Fast Fusion, as with its predecessors, is a true racing game. There is combat, but it’s not in the vein of Wipeout or Mario Kart where you’re given weaponry to help move up the leaderboard. Fast Fusion is about going, well… fast, and while your vessel is pretty nippy to begin with, even on the introductory Subsonic circuits, you need to utilise boosting to succeed.</p>


<p>There’s two types of boost. Firstly, you collect charges as you race, which alongside serving as currency, also give you a shot of nitro for each one you collect. You don’t hold this boost down, instead firing singular shots of it off, allowing you to be more directed with it. These boosts also allow you to attack your competitors, and hitting a player while you’re boosting will see them spin out, slowing them down and putting you ahead.</p>
<p>You gain the other type of boost via the coloured speed pads found on the floor of each circuit. Coming in blue or red, you have to select your vehicle’s frequency to match that – shown in the exhaust fumes coming from your ship – and if they match you’ll speed up significantly.</p>
<p>Get it wrong, and the pad will actually slow you down, electricity arcing from the ship to the pad as it struggles for anti-grav traction. It’s such a simple mechanic, but an incredibly clever one. Many circuits will also stagger differently coloured pads back-to-back, and it throws in rhythm action test of your reactions beyond the actual racing.</p>
<p>You start off with access to three ships, with fourteen standard craft available in total. What’s interesting here, and what gives the game the ‘Fusion’ in the name, is that you can mash two of them together, creating a new craft that draws in elements from each of the original ones. After completing the first cup, I merged the primary ship with one I bought, upping both the top speed and the boost capacity, while adding to the weight, giving it a whole new look along the way.</p>

<p>Despite weighing more, this new ship was a clear improvement, and the whole idea just feels great, like you’re taking part in futuristic racing R&amp;D. It also gives you a ton of options to explore in terms of visuals and stats, giving you an added reason to unlock all of the ships as you clear the different Leagues.</p>
<p>The vehicles here clearly owe a debt to Wipeout’s art direction, but it’s pretty hard to truly innovate in the space when the Psygnosis team perfected the concept on the first attempt, and then upped the fidelity each time It’s simply a stunning looking game though. Fast Fusion looks like a current-gen title, and it’s got to be amongst the best-looking indie racers of all time.</p>
<p>Quite how the team continue to pull off this feat, I’ll never know, but they do, and here it’s delivered in 60FPS with HDR. Interestingly, there’s a host of graphics settings to choose from too, and you can go all the way up to 4K at 30fps if you want Ultra Quality, but there’s presets that target 60fps with varying shadowing and details for 4K, 1440p and 1080p. Frankly, it looks amazing in the 1080p Performance mode, and I was hard pressed to see too many differences in the more graphically intensive settings above it. As long as it’s 60fps, they all feel great.</p>

<p>Those spectacular visuals are combined with genre-required hard-hitting electro and dance, but rather than just relying on the familiar, there’s a suite of interesting instrumentation from around the world, as well as more dramatic, symphonic pieces that wouldn’t sound out of place in a sci-fi movie. The different tracks fit perfectly with the different tracks and areas they represent, and they’re undeniably part of the game’s character and appeal.</p>
<p>Fast Fusion offers plenty of longevity, with the Championship racing your initial gateway into the game. Each League contains multiple races, unlocked via the same currency you use to buy and fuse your ships – it’s worth remembering this at the start, as I spent all my money on ships before realising I needed money to advance to the next League – and there’s a svelte selection of twelve tracks in total to race on. More tracks would be lovely, but it’s worth remembering the £13.50 price point.</p>
<p>There’s then Super Hero Mode, which tasks you with completing a race in first place, without crashing, while jumping decreases boost energy, and that boost energy is also your shield energy. When it calls it Super Hero Mode, it flipping means it, and this is a cruel and punishing reworking of the game’s rules to push you to the limit. It gives you some lovely prize money for succeeding though, so you can buy a new ship after you’ve got over the whole thing.</p>
<p>Time Trial does exactly what you’d expect it to, though it gives you the Shin’en team’s best lap time to beat for each track, once more giving you some cash for achieving it, as well as giving you the bragging rights for beating the people that made the game.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is perhaps the biggest sign that this is a budget release, as there’s a limited online racing component. You can race in splitscreen with up to three friends, or there’s GameShare functionality which lets you beam the game to another Nintendo Switch 2, either locally or via the Switch 2’s new GameChat function. With GameShare everyone gets to race on their own Switch 2, with the host Switch 2 rendering and streaming a game view of the race for each individual player, but you’re playing with only one copy of the game. It’s great that you can experience racing against your friends, but I’ll be hoping that Fast Fusion sells well enough that Shin’en decide to add a true online component in the future.</p>

		<p>The Switch 2 launch day was filled with disappointment for some unlucky GameStop patrons, with reports emerging online of receipts being stapled to the front of Switch 2 boxes going deep enough through the cardboard to damage the screen of the Switch 2 console beneath.</p>
<p>Thankfully, GameStop has quickly followed up on this, figuring out that it was “isolated to one store” and offering replacement consoles to those affected. They’ve also claimed to have confiscated the staplers in question to prevent this happening again!</p>



<p>The GameStop store was one of those in Staten Island, New York that was open for a midnight launch of the Switch 2, with those queueing up to grab a Switch 2 at the earliest possible moment having a real sour note upon opening the box. Someone had the bright idea of stapling the receipts to the front of the Switch 2 box, presumably unaware that the Switch 2 and Joy-Con are placed right beneath this surface. Unfortunately, the staples went deep enough to scratch or puncture the screens, creating two dots of dead pixels.</p>


<p>Obviously the only move from GameStop was to hold up their hands to the error and replace the consoles, and thankfully they seem to have stock available in order to do this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review.1209057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nobody would be complaining about Welcome Tour if it was free. This little introductory experience to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo’s Switch 2</a> feels like a perfectly Nintendo way to do things, turning the Switch 2 itself into a giant convention centre, filled with visitors who are there to check out the new Joy-Con 2, like they’re the latest exhibit in the Louvre. The thing is, we’re being charged £7.99 for this introduction, and while, yes, that also feels like a very Nintendo way to do things, it’s a bit too dry, too scientific, and comes with too little actual fun.</p>

<p>You set out by choosing a faceless avatar to be from the surprisingly long queue of potential guests, before heading up the extremely long escalator onto the exceptionally large left Joy-Con 2. It’s literally a huge version of the console, and one where you can run around, talk to other visitors, bother the staff, and play a selection of different minigames. There’s a handy Information desk nestling beneath the analogue stick, where the staff are only too happy to help you work out what you’re doing here.</p>


<p>Weirdly, the first two games over here on the left Joy-Con 2 are ones that showcase the Switch 2’s new mouse functionality, when around 90% of all humans would use the right Joy-Con instead. I’m not the only one who thinks that’s weird, am I? Hand preferences aside, the first minigame has you avoiding spiky balls falling from the top of the screen, quickly moving your craft around using the mouse and trying to stay alive as long as possible. It’s the most mini of minigames, but it is fun for what it is.</p>
<p>Successfully surviving for long enough in the first level unlocks a second level where you also have to catch stars, so I did. Completing this then opens up a <em>further</em> level, but the medal requirements to unlock this are so high it means coming back much later in your playthrough. The whole experience of Welcome Tour is gamified enough that you’ll want to earn the medals it offers to you, but there’s very few minigames on offer here that I’d be returning to in a week’s time.</p>


<p>The thing it does do is teach you about the Switch 2’s mouse mode. It shows you how it feels, how to set it up, and there’s some nice reassuring haptic rumble from both the Joy-Con when you select the game start. There’s not a ton of games to use the mouse with at launch, so as a Welcome Tour of the console, it is doing its job. Maybe you’ll mouse around the main menus?</p>
<p>Next up, the other minigame showcases the HD Rumble 2 of the Switch 2. Yes, that’s a lot of 2’s. Here you use the mouse to try and judge where the strongest rumble is on a line diagram. It doesn’t sound enthralling, and visually it isn’t, but it was interesting enough to take multiple goes trying to perfect my rumble strength sensing. The game also told me it was my forte, and I like compliments.</p>
<p>That’s it for the opening minigames, with the game’s next trick being to show you things, and then giving you a test on what you’ve seen. I’m not sure if multiple choice quizzes are anyone’s idea of a good time, but Nintendo wants to make sure you’ve not just been going about Welcome Tour with your eyes and ears shut, not paying attention. Paying attention is fun, isn’t it?</p>

<p>When you come across one of these quiz zones, you talk to the quiz giver, and they’ll then fire up four information boards for you to watch and read through, before you come back to take the test. If you thought you’d left English comprehension behind at school, think again.</p>
<p>This will all be of interest to a certain kind of person though. If you like watching people dismantle tech – I’ve already watched someone take apart a brand new Switch 2 and if anything it was a bit upsetting – and you’re interested in how things work, there’s some very detailed information about how the tech has been developed, and how it’s changed since the Switch 1.</p>

<p>It definitely gives you a different view of the console you have in your hands, and while I could have lived without knowing that the HD rumble is attached to the rear of the Joy-Con for the best flowthrough to your palm and hand, now that I know, I appreciate the engineering that’s gone into it. Welcome Tour might be, if anything, a bit of a back slapping exercise by Nintendo, but, on early impressions they deserve at least a few congratulatory fist bumps.</p>
<p>Welcome Tour is a very constrained experience though. If holds you back from wildly running around, peering at the odd analogue stick here and marvelling at a steel button there. Instead, you have to fully explore each area and visit every possible feature point in order to advance to the next, sometimes struggling to find the last blasted hidden point of interest is, while the minigames and quizzes also feel like they’re holding you back, slowly showing their hand rather than having their wares on display. It’s not that it doesn’t hang together, it does, but it’s a very particular, controlled kind of fun.</p>
<p>Somewhat disappointingly, a handful of minigames are also locked away behind needing to own a given accessory, even if you can visit those areas. It’s entirely understandable that the camera minigame would need a camera, but it’s a bit daft to have a whole minigame devoted to back buttons that needs a Pro Controller or a Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Welcome Tour is visually charming. The tiny people wandering around the giant console museum look great, and there’s plenty of incidental details, like the distant hedgerows beneath, lost children sat alone on the edge of a controller and the elevator structures linking different levels. That’s followed through with Nintendo’s trademark presentation: clean, concise, and suitable for all ages.</p>
