		<p>Paper Cult has announced that following feedback from players that played the Tears of Metal Steam Next Fest demo, the decision has been made to push the game’s release back. The new release window that has been given is Q1 2026, allowing the development team to take on board the feedback and use the additional time to polish up later parts of Tears of Metal.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Paper Cult Games said, <em>“First off, a massive thank you to everyone who played the demo, shared feedback, ideas, and reviews! Your support has been incredible, we’re honestly blown away. During Steam Next Fest, Tears of Metal climbed all the way to #16 in player count, earning a spot in Steam’s “50 Most-Played Demos of the October 2025 Event.” That’s huge for us and it’s all thanks to you!Even more heartwarming was earning the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review rating on the demo. It’s been an incredible boost to our morale, and we can’t wait to get the full game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>With all this momentum and plenty (or dare I say infinite) of new feedback in hand, we’ve decided to shift our release window to Q1 2026. We mostly want to take the extra time to polish the experience in the later part of the game. We promise, the wait will be worth it! Thanks again for marching with us. Your support truly gives us the final push to make Tears of Metal everything it deserves to be.”</em></p>

<p>Tears of Metal is a hack and slash co-op roguelike set in the Scottish Highlands. Hordes of enemies have invaded your home island, so it is up to you and your battalion of Scottish warriors to cleave through this vast number of soldiers to take back the island, and discover more about the Dragon Stone Meteor which caused the invasion to begin with. Tears of Metal has been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Galaxies Gaming Showcase, Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios have tempered expectations around the release date for Mouse: P.I For Hire, the 1930’s cartoon inspired first person shooter. A little while ago, the studio said that there would be a release date announcement for the game this weekend, but now that has changed with Mouse: P.I. For Hire now no longer releasing in 2025, but in early 2026 instead.</p>

For Hire - Troy Baker is Jack Pepper | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QhWXpfjBjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios said, <em>“Hey everyone. We know that you are excited for the release date announcement of Mouse: P.I. For Hire at the Galaxies Gaming Showcase this week 23 October. Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026. The support you have shown over the years has meant the world to us. Our single highest priority is for the game to deliver you the best possible experience, and this will help ensure we can live up to that goal. Thanks for everything and we will see you at Galaxies!”</em></p>
<p>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is due to be released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced a second Nintendo Direct stream will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, taking place this week on Thursday, 23rd October at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST, 9AM EDT, 6AM PDT). The stream promises around 60 minutes of content with tons of new info on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive coming from game director Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct 2 – 23/10/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdfrV1vruvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Kirby Air Riders is a sequel to the pink puff ball’s 2003 GameCube original, Kirby Air Ride. The game features a roster of 16 characters drawn from the Kirby universe, with a mixture of both racing and the returning City Trial mode, which is much more like a vehicular combat game, where you rampage around the Skyah city map, powering up your Air Machines in preparation for game-ending minigames.</p>

<p>It’s curious mix, and in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands on with the title back at Gamescom 2025</a>, I said, “Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-will-launch-on-november-20th/">Kirby Air Riders is launching for Nintendo Switch 2 on 20th November</a>.</p>
