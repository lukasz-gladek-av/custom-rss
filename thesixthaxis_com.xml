Today, Enhance Games has released a new limited time demo for Lumines Arise on PS5 and PC via Steam, allowing players get a first taste of the game. The limited window to experience the Lumines Arise demo lasts from today until September 3rd. After that, players will have to wait for the now confirmed release date of November 11th.</p>

<p>The Lumines Arise demo will feature three stages, with those being Arise, Duo Soul, and Chameleon Grove, along with the multiplayer mode of Burst Battle. The Burst feature is indicated by a percentage score that increases as you play, and when it hits 50% or 100% you can activate it. Activating Burst means a shift in how Lumines plays. Instead of blocks clearing when the line passes through them, you will build up blocks to grow the Burst area. The aim is for you to clear as much of the area as possible when the timer expires. In the multiplayer Burst Battle, garbage builds up making the playing area smaller and smaller, but activating burst stops the garbage falling for a time. You want to be able to build up your score and use the Burst at the opportune moment to beat your opponents. To grab the Lumines Arise demo, head to the following links.</p>

<p>The last game Enhance released was Tetris Effect, and in our review we gave it a 10/10 saying, “<em>There’s a point when you’re playing Tetris and everything else seems to fade away. Tetris Effect takes that one step further by bringing the game to PSVR alongside its regular 4K HDR presentation, where the closed circuit of headset, player and controller is the only reality. In the main Journey mode – a collection of stages strung together in a series of EP-like sets – you’re still attempting to remove lines from the playing field by fitting shapes together, but when you combine the low latency response of the PSVR’s screens, the ever-changing visuals and wire yourself up to the music, Tetris Effect’s heady melody of the physical and the experiential offers one of the most compelling arguments for virtual reality yet.”</em></p>
