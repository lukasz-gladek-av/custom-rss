		<p>Nintendo has finally confirmed the release day for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, the musou spin-off set to launch on 6th November 2025 for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JL3PnM_s-Vk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will follow the narrative of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which saw Zelda transported back in time to the distant past and the formation of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases how you can use the Zonai contraptions in combat, as well as combo team-ups with other characters. </p>
<p>The last game in this spin-off series, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, depicting the grand battle to try (and fail) to save Hyrule from the rising evil forces. When the main Zelda series has always been about delving into dungeons and defeating bosses one-by-one, it’s a great change of pace to see the huge wars between the massed forces of good and evil.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">our review of that last game</a>, we said, “Age of Calamity is, for all intents and purposes, a prequel to Breath of the Wild. It might be a spin-off in a separate genre, but it’s clearly a labour of love, and the result is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through one of the most interesting periods of Hyrule. If the first game was a love letter to the Zelda series, this not only improves on this concept in every way, but stands as one of the best Zelda games, period.”</p>

		<p>Nintendo have announced a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yoshi/">Yoshi</a> game aimed at the younger market, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. The plot finds Yoshi jumping inside the pages of a book that has fallen from the sky, and he investigates the creatures he finds within.</p>
<p>The creatures interact with the landscapes, such as helping flowers to bloom, and you can also find other things to do, for example, Dandelions can absorb nutrients and used to break rocks. Anything you discover will be written back into the pages of the book.</p>

		<p>Nintendo shared a new trailer for Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, digging into the relaxed, seaside town gameplay for the esoteric life sim. In its own inimitable way, the launch window was confirmed for Spring 2026, and is coming to Switch 2. </p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life Living the Dream Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uYvj3xvFB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed how you can create and customise the Mii characters that will populate your island, who will then simply go and chill out in this idyllic seaside town. You’ll then have to cater to their needs, such as sating their hunger pangs by handing them a lettuce or something. If characters are bored, you can pick them up and introduce them to other inhabitants of the island, making them into acquaintances and eventually, you’d hope, friends.</p>
<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-65"></sup></p>

		<p>The next Mario Tennis game has been revealed with Mario Tennis Fever arriving on 12th Febrary 2026 exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_KqyXamkgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game brings some new tweaks to the Mario Tennis formula with enhanced movement coming from the ability to slide to reach trickier incoming balls. </p>
<p>Much more impactful, though, will be the special Power Rackets and the Fever Shots that they enable –&nbsp;things like the mini mushroom racket spawning miniaturising mushrooms for your opponents, and the shadow racket creating a ghostly duplicate of your character.</p>
<p>There will be 30 power rackets that can be combined with the 38 playable characters in the game’s roster. </p>

<p>You can take all of these to a whole host of gameplay modes, including the Trial Towers and the Mix It Up mode, the latter of which will add some unexpected rules and modifiers including some Wonder effects inspired by Super Mario Wonder.</p>
<p>Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode. </p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
