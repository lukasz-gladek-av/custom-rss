		<p>It was a very late night if you were watching The Game Awards in the UK, but it wasn’t too hard to stay awake this year as the exciting announcements kept coming all the way to 4AM. What am I most excited about? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">Virtua Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/split-fiction-is-the-new-co-op-game-from-josef-fares-and-he-only-used-a-few-rude-words-to-announce-it/">Split Fiction</a>, with at least one of them appearing next year. That’s all in the future though, and we’re here to talk about what we’ve been playing this week.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more time with Infinity Nikki, which is really just a very good open world platformer, whether you’re also keen on being a super helpful fashionista or not. I’ve also been playing through Indiana Jones and The Great Circle which captures the character unbelievably well. Besides that, it’s been some nostalgic Need for Speed Rivals, a spot of Snow Bros. Wonderland for review and Season 14 of Overwatch 2, where things have so far been looking up for Moira. I did dabble with Marvel Rivals too, but it didn’t hold my attention for too long, despite being a massive Marvel and Overwatch fan.</p>

<p>Before he stayed up right to the very end of The Game Awards, Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2 and a super scary new VR game that he can’t say anything about. He also played Marvel Rivals for precisely 7 minutes but said, “After that I couldn’t stand the ultra perky teenage girl who walks you through the mandatory tutorials.” Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Thaumaturge for review, while squeezing in exactly one hour of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Jim spent most of his time playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review/">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</a> which he says, “I was initially excited for though ran into crashes that ultimately killed my hunger for that Nosgoth nostalgia hit. Hopefully the games are patched with a quick save feature or better checkpointing.” besides that he also jumped in two footed to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, playing more Darktide and Space Marine 2.</p>


<p>Aran has been playing Edge of Allegoria for review. He says, “It looks like a classic RPG from the Game Boy era, and plays like one. I wouldn’t have your kids play it though as it is very raunchy and full of adult themes. My full review should hopefully be up next week. I have also played some Marvel Rivals, and have found it pretty fun. I’ll see if I stick with it long-term though.”</p>
<p>Nic B has been playing the hell out of Pokémon TCG Pocket, telling us, “It’s good fun, but frustrating at times.”</p>
<p>Ade and his partner Laura have been playing the old-school styled RPG Sea of Stars on local co-op. He says, “It’s absolutely brilliant, you can play through the entire game together, solving puzzles and teaming up to take down enemies. It’s up there with It Takes Two for a local co-op experience, highly recommended! Other than that, a spot of Helldivers 2. I’ve been experimenting with Extreme mode, it’s ridiculous!</p>
<p>“Oh, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/">Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a> for review, sadly, despite the early promise, it’s not very good!”</p>

<p>Steve told us, “I’ve been living out my dreams of academia by travelling around the world and punching various flavours of fascist on the nose in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The rest of my time has been taken by the rather less glamorous reality of marking undergraduate essays… I also found time to finish Mario and Luigi Brothership which is a solid 7 but nowhere near the levels of earlier games in the series. Finally, I’ve started Nine Sols and enjoying it aside from getting lost; determined to persevere with the default difficulty but there are a fabulous range of accessibility options.”</p>
<p>And finally, Tef also stayed up all the way through The Game Awards, but before that, he’s made a start on Space Marine 2 and like how stompy the Space Marines are when walking.</p>
<p>And what about you? Did you stay up for The Game Awards? Or have you been playing that little Indy game as well?</p>

		<p>The Venn diagram of people who like tanks and people who like giant mechs might not just be one circle, but it’s probably close enough that it will feel like you’re looking at one of those red and blue 3D pictures without the glasses on. So, having already covered the land, sea and air battles of World of Tanks, Warplanes and Warships, it makes perfect sense that Wargaming’s next game would go all mecha. Enter the Steel Hunters.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in a post-cataclysm world, in which Starfall has polluted the world (because we clearly weren’t doing a quick enough job of it) and forced mankind to evacuate and live in space stations, you’ll play as a Hunter sent back down to the planet to try and harvest Starfall for all the energy and resource it can provide the orbital populace.</p>


<p>It’s a pretty generic premise, and don’t expect to be too surprised by the genres that Wargaming is targeting here, either. This is a blend of hero shooter, battle royale and extraction shooter. But… mechs are pretty dang cool.</p>
<p>Six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, their gigantic mechs keeping them safe from the elements, and handily helping you absolutely massive as you stomp around the world and come across towns, bridges, cars and other manmade structures that have now been left abandoned.</p>


<p>At launch there’s seven hunters to choose from, with the very standard Razorside an all-rounder with frag grenades and a shield recharge ability. Much cooler are the two quadrupeds Ursus and Fenris, who have missiles and greater mobility as their advantages. Heartbreaker is then a sniper stealth assassin, Prophet a glass cannon who’s best staying away from the fight and summoning drones, while Trenchwalker is the combat medic with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better than two or four legs? How about eight! Weaver is an arachnid that’s all about territorial control, deploying one-way shields and being able to switch to a minigun mode that slows movement but allows you to put down a lot of firepower.</p>
<p>There’s a good, solid mixture of different archetypes here, and Wargaming will have plenty of ideas of new mechs to add down the line. What’s also important is how they work together. You’ll always drop and fight as a pair, so having Trenchwalker, Prophet or Weaver could be great for their various forms of second line support abilities alongside a faster-moving Fenris to quickly show force to enemy teams.</p>

<p>Still on the planet are drones that you will want to attack to gain loot from them, whether that’s a boost to shields, energy cells (which feed an in-match experience system), repair kits and more. Each mech has unlockable abilities as you gain experience and work up through five levels –&nbsp;level 3 unlocks the second ability. There’s some potential here for different builds to emerge that can add to the player synergies and tactical choices as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of your tactics will be determined by the game mode. Starfall Harvest has you heading to try and capture and hold towers that will give bonuses to radar, buffs and the like. Mid-game events will also spice things up with a Tag Hunt, where you need to collect the tags of fallen Hunters, and this can lead to unlocking the Colossus if you collect enough –&nbsp;this will transforms you into an even bigger mech for a short amount of time, which can be a powerful bonus.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head with a final extraction phase, as you need to reach the extraction point and hold the position until time runs out or you defeat all the remaining teams. A tiny bit disappointing, only one pair can extract and win, so there’s none of the social mind games of The Division’s Dark Zone, though it will still build up to a natural fever pitch at the end.</p>
<p>In contracts to their empire of historical wargames, Steel Hunters will be quite the change of pace. From tanks with tracks to big stompy mechs, and from pitched battles to a PvPvE game mode that latches onto all the buzzword multiplayer genres currently dominating gaming, will this start a bold new era for the company?</p>
<p>Well, the proof will be in the playing, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">a playtest is now on from 12th to 22nd December</a>, ahead of a wider launch next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-next-big-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future.</p>
<p>The name might sound familiar, as a trademark that Sony registered a little while back. This game has been in development since 2020 and is expected to launch for PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7TVPoxwi74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Intergalactic casts players as Jordan A. Mun (played by Tati Gabrielle), a bounty hunter stranded near Sempiria, a planet that was cut off from the rest of the galaxy hundreds of years ago. There’s a pretty simple goal here, it seems, to collect bounties, and to escape orbit and get out into the real galaxy once more.</p>
<p>“Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps,” Neil Druckmann said, revealing the game on the PlayStation Blog. He continued,&nbsp;“This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.”</p>
<p>The focus will be just as much on characters and emotional storytelling as Naughty Dog’s last few games, with a broad ensemble cast that’s yet to be revealed – we’d put money on Troy Baker having some role, though. The soundtrack will come from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as you can hear in the trailer.</p>
<p>The game leans in on retro-futuristic tech, with a snazzy Porsche space ship, featuring more than a few CRT screens, Sony multi-disc CD player, puffy Cyberpunk-y jackets, and all the rest. Plenty of familiar fodder, but we’re very keen to see how Naughty Dog can weave a rich tapestry around this – after all, The Last of Us is an all-time great game, but it’s built around a very zombie apocalypse adjacent world and setting.</p>

		<p>Adhoc Games had a reveal trailer for Dispatch at The Game Awards, a superhero workplace comedy from the writers and directors of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright.</p>
<p>There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but there’s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>
