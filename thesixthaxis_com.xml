		<p>Semiwork has announced that it is looking at what to bring in the next big update for R.E.P.O, and the studio wants the players to give their input on what they want. Players can leave comments on in the comments on YouTube or through the <a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Frepo">R.E.P.O Discord</a> In addition, Semiwork is working on a hotfix following the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/r-e-p-o-gets-10-new-monsters-in-its-monster-update/">&nbsp;Monster Update</a> that was released last week. One of the things that will be added in the R.E.P.O hotfix will be an Arachnophobia Mode, as well as some enemy tweaks.</p>

<p>Semiwork has also announced that there will be a short break when it comes to R.E.P.O videos so the team can have a bit of a rest. The break will not be that long with information to come when the team has decided on what direction to go with for the next R.E.P.O update.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

		<p>Blue Dot Games has announced that following its Next Fest demo, ’83’s early access will now be releasing in 2026 and not this year as originally planned. The extra time will allow Blue Dot Games to address the issues raised by the players when playing the ’83 demo, including the UI, gunplay, and movement amongst features that will be addressed.</p>
<p><iframe title="'83 – Steam NextFest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t72zJNyJt_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Blue Dot Games wrote, <em>“Following overwhelming feedback on the Steam Next Fest demo, we’ve made the decision to shift our Early Access release of ’83 out of 2025 and into early 2026. We believe in ‘83 and are committed to doing what’s best for both the project and our community.&nbsp;<wbr>We’re using this additional development time to focus on key areas the community told us matter most:&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gunplay and feel&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Optimisation and performance&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Graphical fidelity and visual polish&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Overhaul of the UI&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Movement and animations&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>General stability and bug fixes&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The demo gave us a vital snapshot of how ’83 plays in the hands of a broad range of players, and we’re taking all of that data and feedback seriously. Our goal is to deliver an Early Access experience that reflects the ambition of the project, but more importantly, something you genuinely enjoy playing and want to return to. On top of the key areas listed above, we are also working hard to correct and improve our models for weapons, uniforms, gear and vehicles where the need for improvements has been identified.&nbsp;<wbr>Thank you again for your patience, enthusiasm, and for holding us to the highest standard. We’re listening, and we’ll be back with more updates as we continue building ’83.”</em></p>

<p>’83 is a 40v40 squad based first person shooter set during an alternate history where the Cold War erupted into full on conflict, with NATO and the USSR battling across Europe. Players can choose which side to play on as they battle in matches that will last 30 to 40 minutes, while players who take the Commander role will have an overview to help guide their sides.</p>
