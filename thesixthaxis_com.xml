		<p>Sony has reversed course on one of their most unpopular policies, making having a PlayStation Network account optional on PC. Instead of requiring a PSN log in they will offer incentives for signing up or logging into an existing account.</p>
<p>The change has been made just in time for tomorrow’s release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/spider-man-2-swings-onto-pc-in-january-2025/">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC</a>, and will apply for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered when that releases in April. It is also being rolled back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC</a>, with in-game content unlocks being added soon.</p>


<p>For the rest of the PlayStation Studios library on PC, games with online multiplayer modes will still require PSN – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has online co-op, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-is-coming-to-pc-in-may/">Ghost of Tsushima’s Legends mode</a> will still need PSN, but it is not needed for the single player. The exception to that is that the backlash to adding the requirement to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was so severe that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">Sony backed down before implementing it</a>.</p>
<p>There’s another exception with the completely single-player Until Dawn remake. Hopefully that will be amended soon to have a more clear-cut policy.</p>
<p>Prior to making PSN mandatory last year, Sony had been giving bonus unlocks and content to those logging in – bonus costumes for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/horizon-forbidden-west-pc-specs-confirmed/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, for example – and they’ve basically gone back to that plan.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s coming to the four games mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong> – Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</li>
<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> – Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver&nbsp;and 250 XP)</li>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</strong> – +50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras, Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong> – Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</li>
</ul>
