		<p>Treyarch have posted a video explaining the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Endgame content, and the short answer is “a lot.”</p>
<p>Once you have finished the main campaign, the entire Avalon map unlocks for 32-player PvE epilogue with new gamplay, and new intel. You can bring teammates into Endgame even if they have not completed the campaign themselves. You will play as either a character from the campaign or an entirely new combatant of your own making with unique abilities.</p>


<p>Black Ops 7 Endgame has four zones of difficulty and the map features landmarks and features from many older COD games, including Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and Black Ops 6. As you fight your combat rating will increase and at certain points you will be given the option to pick a new skill.</p>

<p>Recently the file size for the game has been revealed. The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>

<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>Elder Scrolls 6 release date</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda Game Studio’s Todd Howard has stated that The Elder Scrolls 6 is &nbsp;“still a long way off” despite being announced at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/11/the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-starfield-announced-by-bethesda/">&nbsp;E3 2018</a>.&nbsp; Before that announcement <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/dont-expect-to-see-the-elder-scrolls-6-any-time-soon/">we noted that</a> “we probably won’t see a new Elder Scrolls until the 2020’s” which seemed outrageous at the time but now appears to be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>“I’m preaching patience,” explains Todd, “I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”&nbsp; So there you go, do not get your hopes up for a good three or four years at least and you will be fine.&nbsp; “I think it’s good for an audience to have a break – The Elder Scroll<em>s</em> has been too long, let’s be clear,” he adds, “But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.”</p>


<p>Todd also hinted that The Elder Scrolls 6 may arrive with no advertising or pre-sales. When asked about the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/the-elders-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-has-been-announced-and-its-out-today/"> surprise release of the Oblivion remaster</a> and if something similar could happen to The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd commented, “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p>
<p>When Microsoft bought Bethesda, a document leaked that showed that neither Starfield, Redfall, or The Elder Scrolls 6 would come to PlayStation. Despite Xbox juggernauts Forza and Halo landing on the Sony console, this image is still holds true with no sign of Starfield or Redfall on PS5. The remaster of Oblivion, a Bethesda game, did make it onto PlayStation 5, but that was developed outside of Bethesda’s main studio</p>


<p>No details for The Elder Scrolls 6 have been revealed, just the fancy and completely CGI trailer that probably won’t bare any resemblance to the game when it’s finally released near the end of this decade. Maybe. It’s quite nice to look at so maybe watch it one more time and then forget about it for a while.</p>
