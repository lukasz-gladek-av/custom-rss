		<p>CI Games has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> Version 2.0, a huge update to the game that brings improvements to combat, characters, adds shared progression in co-op, and also introduces a free Friend’s Pass scheme to the game.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone update, the game is at steep 67-72% discount through the PlayStation Spring Sale until 23rd April, until 24th April on Epic, and until 1st May on Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - VERSION 2.0 (Free Friend’s Pass, Shared Progression Co-op) | PC, PS5, Xbox X|S" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the free Friend’s Pass, you need to purchase just one copy of the game in order to play co-op, inviting any other person that you like to join, much like the same scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction</a>. A special Friend’s Pass version of the game is now available across PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5, giving offline access to the tutorial and character creator, and also allowing for full crossplay co-op.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the shared progression in co-op now saves all main story progress for both players that start a new game together, so long as you’ve defeated a similar number of main bosses. Both players retain their loot, 100% vigor and can revive one another in an online session. The previous co-op progression style is also retained, if you prefer that.</p>

<p>Read more about the nitty-gritty of how this works in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLordsOfTheFallen/comments/1k1g6bk/lotf_v20_coop_faq/">FAQ on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>These are already pretty significant additions, but CI Games has continued to iterate on the gameplay since the last update, version 1.7, was released in December. Version 2.0 has revamped combat and movement with smoother animations, weapon response, lock-on, evasions and more. There’s now a dedicated jump button for improved platforming, too.</p>
<p>The character creator has been overhauled, leading into an improved tutorial, and there’s a modernised UI and HUD through the game as well.</p>
<p>“Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates” said Marek Tymninski, CEO of CI Games. “The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.”</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen underwhelmed upon its original release in 2023, despite having its intriguing twinned world mechanic and looking to be a more distinctive game than the 2014 title that it supplanted. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review/">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, Jason said, “I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</p>
<p>A sequel is in development, with an expected release in 2026, so it’s high time that CI Games wrap up the continued support of this title and put their full focus onto the next game.</p>

		<p>While we all look ahead to gorging ourselves on chocolate eggs in a few days time, the short week and extra long weekend will also give plenty time for playing more games than usual. That’s what the future holds, but what about the past? What have we all been playing the last seven days?</p>
<p>There’s been an awful lot of Blue Prince being played in my house, but not by me outside of when I helped with a light switching puzzle. Instead, I’ve made the smallest of starts on Xenoblade Chronicles 2, finally getting round to a game that I must have bought about 6 years ago now, and I’ve touched on a couple games for preview in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Dom’s been away all week on holiday, taking his Switch and 3DS along for company – no doubt hoping to snag a StreetPass visitor or two on his travels – though he’s not actually told me what, if anything, he’s managed to play. So I’m going to suggest that they’ve spent the whole week playing Mario Party games.</p>
<p>Aran has found himself managing Promise Mascot Agency, and as he nears the end of the story, he says that Pinky is likely to go down as the best supporting character of this year – something that Pinky and the Brain fans would certainly agree on.</p>

<p>Sticking with the A’s, Ade has played more Atomfall while he takes a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He’s had fun playing a spot of “Danger Cricket”, as I’m calling it, knocking away thrown grenades with his cricket bat, and generally having a lovely time in the Lake District. He’s also made a return to Helldivers 2.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, has not taken a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, eliminating a few more targets from&nbsp;Yasuke and Naoe’s naughty lists – “I’m not particularly fond of the game’s ever-expanding objective board which seems to sprout new quests every time you look away, though it does give me plenty to do while travelling between story mission markers.”</p>
<p>Alongsdie that, his daughter is getting more interested in video games, so they’ve been playing My Friend Peppa Pig and Cars 3.</p>
<p>It’s been a bit of Hogwarts Legacy and Terraria for Gamoc, as he’s now wrapped up the main story of the former, while Miguel has been playing&nbsp; Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, a bunch of The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, and a little pinch of Blue Prince.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with Steve:</p>
<p>“This week I have played through South of Midnight which I absolutely loved, and took your advice by downloading the soundtrack which has got plenty of repeat plays. I also continued my Sisyphean quest to 100% Lego Skywalker Saga which is ongoing (perhaps eternally). Got lost in Metroid Dread so waiting til I can play it docked for a clearer view of the map. Did manage to deflect one EMMI attack which made me feel like a boss until I got myself stuck in a dead end and was killed immediately after… Finally, I’ve played a couple of small indie games for review.”</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What have you played this week, and what do you have in store for the doubly long weekend?</p>

		<p>Legion Studios has released a new trailer for Covenant, a first-person dark fantasy combat game, coming from a team of former AAA game developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Covenant casts you as a warrior angel, coming down to exact martial arts vengeance on those who stand in your way, creatures from fallen empires that remain.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of blurb:</p>
<p><i>Experience Creation through the eyes of the last living messenger – a warrior angel sent to carry out the will of the Composers. The oldest of your kind, Malach, has fallen to the abyss – leaving in his wake a trail of destruction. You must follow in the footsteps of his final days in order to uncover the nature of his fall – and in doing so, reveal the slumbering forces hidden within Creation.</i></p>

<p>Featuring an interconnected Soulslike world that is punctuated by major boss battles, the hook here is that you’re playing in first person, using different fighting stances, spells and weapons in battle. Adaptability is key here, where different stances completely overhaul your fighting style, down to the way that you jump and kick, which is mixed with the variety of weapons available to you. These can, similar to Bloodborne, be used in a 1-hand and 2-hand form, making you more powerful but less mobile.</p>
<p>Player progression comes from crafting and applying upgrades in ring slots, while weapons are upgraded, spells grow stronger and new stances are discovered.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting sounding game with a mix of Soulslike and first person quite a distinctive one. We’re keen to see how this comes together.</p>
