		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> is set to release in March 2025 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC with full cross-play. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 will also have closed beta tests, with<a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">&nbsp;sign-ups here</a> on the Killing Floor site.</p>
<p>The trailer takes us to Texas, where a zed outbreak has consumed a Horzine facility, and your of Nightfall characters will need to head in and clear things up.</p>
<p>It gives a first look at the Ninja, Medic and Sharpshooter character classes, as well as a glimpse of the Chimera boss.</p>

<p>These days, character classes also need to have, well, a character attached to them, and so we meet Luna as the Sharpshooter, whose rifles have high damage and penetration, with skills that can pivot her character from precision to run and gun marksman. Her gadget is the Death’s Hand, an explosive homing arrow.<i></i></p>
<p>Obi is the medic, who was fired from Horzine for being too ethical and not profitable enough. He keeps teammates alive with healing darts and grenades, pivoting character build from self preservation to healing allies. His gadget is Sanctum, a field projector that heals allies, while damaging and slowing enemies.&nbsp;<i></i></p>
<p>Finally there’s Nakata the ninja assassin, joining Nightfall to atone for his former sins. With swords and bows, he’s a melee specialist that can block and parry larger enemies, but can pivot from front line melee combat to more nimble hit and run tactics. His gadget is the Hebi-ken grappling hook, which can amp up attacks if you grapple to enemies.</p>
<p>There are six specialists with the game at launch, with the first three having been <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/news/nightfall-news-specialist-deep-dive/">revealed back in October</a>. These included Foster the Commando, Devlin the Firebug and Imran the Engineer.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, with the not too surprising news that their RPG sequel is also coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, in 2025. Oh, and day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, of course.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the notion of Xbox exclusivity for this game has been vented out the airlock, though that’s fairly sensible in this case. Microsoft acquired the studio back in 2018, but chose not to buy out the publishing deal with Private Division, which allowed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> to release cross-platform across PS4, Xbox One and PC. The Outer Worlds 2 is Xbox published, but…. well, Xbox is effectively giving up on platform exclusivity. It’s not clear if this will be a simultaneous release, but there’s nothing to suggest timed exclusivity in this instance.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature within the Secret Level anthology series on Amazon Prime Video this month, with an episode dedicated to this universe to debut on 17th December, featuring a short story that takes place between the events of&nbsp;The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only Obsidian game out next year, with the tongue being removed from cheek for their more serious fantasy RPG adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed, coming out in February</a>. The Outer Worlds 2 will be a nice tonal companion to that!</p>

		<p>It was a very late night if you were watching The Game Awards in the UK, but it wasn’t too hard to stay awake this year as the exciting announcements kept coming all the way to 4AM. What am I most excited about? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">Virtua Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/split-fiction-is-the-new-co-op-game-from-josef-fares-and-he-only-used-a-few-rude-words-to-announce-it/">Split Fiction</a>, with at least one of them appearing next year. That’s all in the future though, and we’re here to talk about what we’ve been playing this week.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more time with Infinity Nikki, which is really just a very good open world platformer, whether you’re also keen on being a super helpful fashionista or not. I’ve also been playing through Indiana Jones and The Great Circle which captures the character unbelievably well. Besides that, it’s been some nostalgic Need for Speed Rivals, a spot of Snow Bros. Wonderland for review and Season 14 of Overwatch 2, where things have so far been looking up for Moira. I did dabble with Marvel Rivals too, but it didn’t hold my attention for too long, despite being a massive Marvel and Overwatch fan.</p>

<p>Before he stayed up right to the very end of The Game Awards, Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2 and a super scary new VR game that he can’t say anything about. He also played Marvel Rivals for precisely 7 minutes but said, “After that I couldn’t stand the ultra perky teenage girl who walks you through the mandatory tutorials.” Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Thaumaturge for review, while squeezing in exactly one hour of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Jim spent most of his time playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review/">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</a> which he says, “I was initially excited for though ran into crashes that ultimately killed my hunger for that Nosgoth nostalgia hit. Hopefully the games are patched with a quick save feature or better checkpointing.” besides that he also jumped in two footed to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, playing more Darktide and Space Marine 2.</p>


<p>Aran has been playing Edge of Allegoria for review. He says, “It looks like a classic RPG from the Game Boy era, and plays like one. I wouldn’t have your kids play it though as it is very raunchy and full of adult themes. My full review should hopefully be up next week. I have also played some Marvel Rivals, and have found it pretty fun. I’ll see if I stick with it long-term though.”</p>
<p>Nic B has been playing the hell out of Pokémon TCG Pocket, telling us, “It’s good fun, but frustrating at times.”</p>
<p>Ade and his partner Laura have been playing the old-school styled RPG Sea of Stars on local co-op. He says, “It’s absolutely brilliant, you can play through the entire game together, solving puzzles and teaming up to take down enemies. It’s up there with It Takes Two for a local co-op experience, highly recommended! Other than that, a spot of Helldivers 2. I’ve been experimenting with Extreme mode, it’s ridiculous!</p>
<p>“Oh, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/">Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a> for review, sadly, despite the early promise, it’s not very good!”</p>

<p>Steve told us, “I’ve been living out my dreams of academia by travelling around the world and punching various flavours of fascist on the nose in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The rest of my time has been taken by the rather less glamorous reality of marking undergraduate essays… I also found time to finish Mario and Luigi Brothership which is a solid 7 but nowhere near the levels of earlier games in the series. Finally, I’ve started Nine Sols and enjoying it aside from getting lost; determined to persevere with the default difficulty but there are a fabulous range of accessibility options.”</p>
<p>And finally, Tef also stayed up all the way through The Game Awards, but before that, he’s made a start on Space Marine 2 and like how stompy the Space Marines are when walking.</p>
<p>And what about you? Did you stay up for The Game Awards? Or have you been playing that little Indy game as well?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargaming%E2%80%99s-latest.1060461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Venn diagram of people who like tanks and people who like giant mechs might not just be one circle, but it’s probably close enough that it will feel like you’re looking at one of those red and blue 3D pictures without the glasses on. So, having already covered the land, sea and air battles of World of Tanks, Warplanes and Warships, it makes perfect sense that Wargaming’s next game would go all mecha. Enter the Steel Hunters.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in a post-cataclysm world, in which Starfall has polluted the world (because we clearly weren’t doing a quick enough job of it) and forced mankind to evacuate and live in space stations, you’ll play as a Hunter sent back down to the planet to try and harvest Starfall for all the energy and resource it can provide the orbital populace.</p>


<p>It’s a pretty generic premise, and don’t expect to be too surprised by the genres that Wargaming is targeting here, either. This is a blend of hero shooter, battle royale and extraction shooter. But… mechs are pretty dang cool.</p>
<p>Six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, their gigantic mechs keeping them safe from the elements, and handily helping you absolutely massive as you stomp around the world and come across towns, bridges, cars and other manmade structures that have now been left abandoned.</p>


<p>At launch there’s seven hunters to choose from, with the very standard Razorside an all-rounder with frag grenades and a shield recharge ability. Much cooler are the two quadrupeds Ursus and Fenris, who have missiles and greater mobility as their advantages. Heartbreaker is then a sniper stealth assassin, Prophet a glass cannon who’s best staying away from the fight and summoning drones, while Trenchwalker is the combat medic with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better than two or four legs? How about eight! Weaver is an arachnid that’s all about territorial control, deploying one-way shields and being able to switch to a minigun mode that slows movement but allows you to put down a lot of firepower.</p>
<p>There’s a good, solid mixture of different archetypes here, and Wargaming will have plenty of ideas of new mechs to add down the line. What’s also important is how they work together. You’ll always drop and fight as a pair, so having Trenchwalker, Prophet or Weaver could be great for their various forms of second line support abilities alongside a faster-moving Fenris to quickly show force to enemy teams.</p>

<p>Still on the planet are drones that you will want to attack to gain loot from them, whether that’s a boost to shields, energy cells (which feed an in-match experience system), repair kits and more. Each mech has unlockable abilities as you gain experience and work up through five levels –&nbsp;level 3 unlocks the second ability. There’s some potential here for different builds to emerge that can add to the player synergies and tactical choices as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of your tactics will be determined by the game mode. Starfall Harvest has you heading to try and capture and hold towers that will give bonuses to radar, buffs and the like. Mid-game events will also spice things up with a Tag Hunt, where you need to collect the tags of fallen Hunters, and this can lead to unlocking the Colossus if you collect enough –&nbsp;this will transforms you into an even bigger mech for a short amount of time, which can be a powerful bonus.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head with a final extraction phase, as you need to reach the extraction point and hold the position until time runs out or you defeat all the remaining teams. A tiny bit disappointing, only one pair can extract and win, so there’s none of the social mind games of The Division’s Dark Zone, though it will still build up to a natural fever pitch at the end.</p>
<p>In contracts to their empire of historical wargames, Steel Hunters will be quite the change of pace. From tanks with tracks to big stompy mechs, and from pitched battles to a PvPvE game mode that latches onto all the buzzword multiplayer genres currently dominating gaming, will this start a bold new era for the company?</p>
<p>Well, the proof will be in the playing, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">a playtest is now on from 12th to 22nd December</a>, ahead of a wider launch next year.</p>
