			<p>There was a time, in a bygone era full of hope and positivity known as the early ‘90s, when Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe was unprecedented champion of all sport video games. Sure, that title reign only lasted until 1992 when Sensible Soccer became the darling of the school playground, but it was long enough for Speedball 2 to become a classic of its fledging genre. Now, some 35 years later, Rebellion are attempting to put this aged champ on top with a series reboot, snappily titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/speedball">Speedball</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball - Console Launch Trailer | Xbox X/S, PlayStation 5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExuLkHNFNlg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the start, let me just say that Speedball plays a darn good game of Speedball. Don’t let the snazzy 3D visuals fool you, Rebellion’s version is as fast and furious as you remember the original games being, maybe even more so. Speedball is a 6 v 6 ultraviolet conglomeration of American Football, Rugby and the 1975 cult classic film, Rollerball. Played from a top-down perspective, each enclosed arena is filled with traps to navigate – flamethrower turrets, spike pillars, explosives and more. It can get pretty hectic with players flinging the metal ball from teammate to teammate before beating the opposing goalie and lobbing the blood-soaked orb into the goal. Rules are minimal, players can tackle each other as much as they like. Heck, you even get points for injuring the opposing team, meaning you don’t even need to win with goals, just violence.</p>


<p>The players themselves are delightfully athletic, each capable of wall-running in that Assassin’s Creed style, flipping over obstacles, and leaping high above enemy tackles. Controls are incredibly responsive, so after just a short time you’ll be flipping over traps, before running along a wall, leaping from its surface, rolling back to your feet and finally launching into an offensive tackle with the best of them. In fact, Speedball goes out of its way to make you look good whilst playing it, even if you’re a new player that’s not entirely sure what’s actually going on. Thanks to a rather good tutorial though, you won’t be confused for long, as each element of the game is explored, from the opening whistle to the gore-splatted finale.</p>


<p>I say gore-splattered, because this sports game can get very nasty, particularly when you take into account Rebellion’s genius addition to the traditional Speedball formula, jet packs. Each player essentially has a rocket fuelled missile strapped to their back, allowing them to blast across the arena like a distinctly non-child friendly version of Buzz Lightyear who’s decided to flatten you. These super tackles add a satisfying element of risk and reward to the gameplay, you can dash across the entire arena to take out another player, but you can just as easily send yourself splatting headfirst into a wall. The crowd will love it either way, and so will you.</p>
<p>In terms of team selection, this is a who’s who of beloved players from the original games. Though this time every single team has a distinctive look and unique abilities. The highlight for me? As a devoted 2000AD fan the option of fielding a team of Mega-City One Judges was totally zarjaz. Also, does this mean that Speedball is definitively part of the Dreddverse? I certainly hope so!</p>

<p>Accessible and enjoyable with very little practice, Speedball is ideally suited for local play, with newbies soon able to provide a threat to even experienced Speedballers. With games over in a dinky five minutes, this is perfect pick up and play fodder. Outside of local play however, Speedball isn’t nearly as sure footed. The singe player league mode lacks in depth. Sure, you can hire new players, and ongoing injuries need to be accounted for, but otherwise this is just playing eighteen matches in a row by any other name. It’s basic, formulaic, and is lacking in imagination, failing to keep things fresh and surprising for the player</p>

<p>The same is true of the online mode. Online games play smoothly enough, though a lot of the fun is lost due to lacking the comradery of a couch session. You can set up a league between friends, but it’s all rather basic. An online global league mode, with brackets and winners each season and unique in-game prizes would certainly be a welcome addition, but that relies on having a large enough playerbase. Otherwise this is just a series of exhibition matches and little else.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>AMD, the makers of the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) technology that powers the current Xbox and PlayStation consoles, have rather casually revealed that the next Xbox could be released as early as next year.</p>
<p>The information was revealed during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said “Development of&nbsp;Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>


<p>It is important to note that the good Doctor only said they could support <em>“a”</em> launch rather than <em>“the”</em> launch, but other leaks have suggested that Microsoft are aiming for next year,&nbsp; one would assume sometime near Christmas as usual.</p>
<p>What form the next Xbox will take is the subject of intense speculation. While they are clearly talking to AMD about some powerful hardware, documents revealed during the FTC trial when Microsoft purchased Activision revealed that they were aiming for a “hybrid console”.&nbsp; This could suggest a move towards streaming games that run off powerful server farms rather than having a top-range console at home.&nbsp; There are also concerns over the huge price increases in RAM and GPUs, a high-powered next Xbox could be very expensive, whereas a streaming machine would require less under the hood and would boost sales of Xbox Games Pass.</p>
<p>The idea of Microsoft even making a new console could raise a few eyebrows, it is fair to say they have been absolutely thrashed by PlayStation and Nintendo this generation. Console sales, meagre as they are, have had a 32% decline year-on-year. While never specifically stated, the low sales of Xbox consoles are clearly a contributing factor to Microsoft’s decision to start releasing its exclusive franchises, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-launch-confirmed-for-may-coming-first-to-xbox-and-pc-and-later-to-ps5/">Forza</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/fable-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-this-autumn-and-its-looking-great/">Fable,</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo,</a> on PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox, and indeed PlayStation,&nbsp; also have the same issue as other tech manufacturers, such as Apple, in that it is much harder for customers to perceive any major changes between generations. It seems obvious that the next-gen consoles will run at 4K with decent frame rates, but apart from looking a bit prettier, there’s not much they can add. We already have SDD drives for fast loading, haptic feedback, and Dolby 3D Audio, and it’s not like the console manufacturers can do something snazzy like making the console fold in half like a phone.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the idea of a hybrid console. Could the next Xbox be a portable device with a dock for playing at home? Microsoft have certainly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x/">been exploring that area</a> and it would keep costs down, boost sales of Game Pass, and give them a much-needed selling point to attract customers.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, you see a game that you just want to snuggle. Its characters look like they might be the plushest, most cheerful soft toys, while its vibes are so heartwarming and welcoming that you need to play it now, just to purge any stress you might have hanging around. That’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866920/NAMAKORIUM/">Namakorium</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="NAMAKORIUM Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixIOn5yz9qY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Namakorium is a sea-based multiplayer RTS, where you take control of a group of the Namako – that’s sea cucumbers to you or me – and have to clean up the ocean, getting rid of the pollution with up to three other players. It looks utterly enticing, with some Pokemon-like vibes on the go, and it’s undoubtedly overwhelmingly positive, with a great environmental message as well.</p>
<p>You have to balance your resources – that’s the food that you need to keep your cucumbers alive – build habitats and other buildings, before using an array of different Namako to tackle the different kind of pollutions littering the sea floor. That also seems to extend to giant, polluted Namako, who I guess you have to purify to. I’m not sure if that means having the other sea cucumbers nibbling away at it, but, we’ll have to check the game out to find out!</p>
<p>Namakorium has just entered Early Access, and there’s a nice 20% discount in place at the moment for those willing to hop into some cucumber-based pollution cleaning action. Developer Polyscape Inc. are listening to all of the early feedback and already have a route map in place for the game’s development as it heads towards a fully 1.0 release.</p>


<p>Namakorium also has a crowdfunding campaign that aims to promote the game globally which was launched on January 9, 2026. The campaign achieved and surpassed its funding goal in just a single day, showing just how high the global demand is for a game like Namakorium. The campaign is set to continue until February 28, 2026 and will be expanded on with new rewards and new stretch goals as more people sign up.</p>
