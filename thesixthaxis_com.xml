		<p>If you like Helldivers then I recommend you keep an hour free to watch For Liberty! which is a new fan-made film based on Helldivers 2. It is exceptionally professional with spectacular animation and a rousing score that features familiar-sounding riffs.</p>
<p>It’s also very funny and captures the expandability of the Helldivers along with the fascist regime hiding under the name of Managed Democracy. There’s even a little Drag Race reference which I was not expecting.</p>


<p>For Liberty! finds the Helldivers on a planet where the Automatons are conducting experiments on the Terminids and creating cyborg bugs, but for what reason? The plot follows a female Helldiver as they investigate what is going and, of course, kill an awful lot of robots and bugs. It also cleverly uses the first person perspective from the game for a dramatic key moment, and like all good franchise films, teases a sequel right at the very end of the credits.</p>
<p>You can watch the entire movie below, but if you like it go and give them a like and follow on YouTube where you can find out more about the film.</p>

A Helldivers Film (Full Movie)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7nXj34kwIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a huge hit for Sony with an<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/"> Xbox X|S version launching this yea</a>r. On December 2nd 2025 the Python Commandos Premium Warbond will launch with three brand new stratagems and a new primary weapon. The new gun, a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. It’s “heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one!”</p>

<p>You will also get the M-1000 Maxigun is belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, and there’s a new Guard Dog assistant, this one is armed with a flamethrower. There is new armour, new emotes, new capes and all the usual cosmetic bobbins.</p>
<p>Alongside For Liberty! there is also an official Helldivers film<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/"> on the way</a>. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, but there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>

		<p>Right out from the grand finale to Chapter 6, Fortnite has kicked into Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, starting a new era for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite-battle-royale">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> at the Golden Coast. This is more than just a bunch of new locations and branded tie-ins, though, with a clutch of core gameplay changes, including boss battles, simple build and self revives.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eln66CJHna8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One change is how you drop into your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> match, with the Battle Bus now out of commission and Storm Surfing the way that you reach the Island instead. From there, the map has new POIs including Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, and Classified Canyon.</p>
<p>But really it’s all about the new gameplay tweaks and additions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv2zM8jI4gU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay in the Game&nbsp;– In the very rare occasion&nbsp;players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out).
<ul>
<li>Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move.</li>
<li>Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defeat the Boss, Be the Boss&nbsp;– Defeat bosses to claim their loot, powers, and transform into them! Becoming a boss grants full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a powerful ability. Careful: boss positions remain visible to nearby opponents at all times!</li>
<li>Simple Build&nbsp;– Simple Build is an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that makes learning how to build simpler. Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that the new battle pass has got a whole host of film references that 12-year-olds won’t really understand. The Bride from Kill Bill is turning up, katana in hand, and Marty McFly will bring 1980s chic to 2025 (a decade on from the “future” that he ended up visiting in the sequel).</p>
<p>This is all a little bit temporary, though. The Battle Bus returns on 4th December, at which point Reload will come back online with the Surf City map, Blitz Royale will have the new Starfall Island map, and ranked will also return. Fortnite OG will also return on 11th December with Season 7.</p>
