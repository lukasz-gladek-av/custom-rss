		<p>Developer Multiverse has announced that it is delaying Pax Autocratica’s early access release date again. It was originally scheduled for February 2nd, then moved to March 4th. Now, the release date has been set for May 7th, meaning an additional two month delay. The reason is that from further internal testing, the studio has decided it needs more time before the colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid is ready.</p>

<p>In a statement the developer Multiverse highlighted three particular areas for improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Early Experience &amp; Onboarding – Final adjustments to how new citizens are introduced to core systems, improving early-game flow, clarity, and pacing based on player feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Core Systems Polish &amp; Balance – Light tuning across progression, base building, and management systems to incorporate requested quality-of-life improvements and ensure a smoother, more consistent experience.</em></li>
<li><em>Performance &amp; Stability – Ongoing optimization and bug fixing to address reported performance issues, edge cases, and crashes before Early Access authorization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>
