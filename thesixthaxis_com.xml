		<p>Rockfish has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>: Wrath of the Ancients, a major expansion to their space adventure that adds a new post-game story, more star systems, side quests and more when it launches for PlayStation, Xbox and PC this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | Wrath of the Ancients — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jij3a23hx3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Apparently the community has bugged Rockfish about the Aethon system long enough – to be fair, Rockfish were the ones teasing it – but Aethon will be just one star system within this expansion, in which you’ll explore several star systems from the Okkar civilization.</p>
<p>But who are the Okkar? Well, they’re an emerging faction appearing just as attacks using weapons from the Ancients have sparked a fresh conflict in Cluster 34, using these attacks ostensibly by the Ancients as justification for their own possible hostilities. You and your crew have to head to the Okkar Homeworlds to try and defuse the situation.</p>
<p>This expansion will push the game’s lore ahead, but it will also bring new twists to the combat. You’ll be able to snag an Okkar Wraith ship and use it’s various new abilities against challenging new enemies. Existing ships will also be compatible with the new weapons and gear, including new upgradable Okkar equipment – more details on those at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Everspace 2 was a big change from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/18/everspace-stellar-edition-review/">the original game</a>. That had been a roguelike space adventure, but the sequel morphed into a more traditional narrative led space shooter. We loved the change, with Ade saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/27/everspace-2-review/">Everspace 2 review</a>, “I started Everspace 2 deeply unsure about a space looter shooter. Tens of hours later I don’t want to play anything else. Everspace 2 is a towering achievement of space-based thrills and spills. It absolutely deserves your attention.”</p>
