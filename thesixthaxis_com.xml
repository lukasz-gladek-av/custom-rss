		<p>An open beta for Steel Hunters, Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game, is now live on Steam as part of a broader Steam Publisher Weekend for the World of Tanks company.</p>
<p>The Steel Hunters beta is live now and through the weekend, from 20th February until 24th February, with a little competition to find the top players each day and prizes to be won.</p>


<p>Through the weekend, the top 10 players on the daily leaderboard will have a chance to win Steam gift cards and exclusive physical merchandise. All players will be able to compete and unlock a Trenchwalker skin that will carry through to the full game.</p>

<p>Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games. This is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>

<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>
