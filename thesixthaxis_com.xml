		<p>GAME has announced it has cancelled some Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, and the company has said it is trying to re-instate some of those pre-orders. The reason for the cancellation of these orders has not been stated. GAME has emailed affected customers about the cancellations, and has said it will send further details about next steps. The full statement is below.</p>
<p><em>“We sincerely apologise for the recent cancellation of some Nintendo Switch 2 preorders. We understand how disappointing this is, especially for those who have been eagerly awaiting their order. We’re currently working hard to reinstate as many preorders affected as possible. If your order was impacted, please know that we’re doing everything we can and will be in touch with further updates and next steps. Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to resolve this. We truly appreciate your support.”</em></p>


<p>Those who have had their pre-orders cancelled are unlikely to be able to secure a pre-order anywhere else.<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-uk-pre-orders-argos-has-stock/"> All retailers went out of stock</a> on the day they were available to pre-order, which was April 8th. There is only one week to go until the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released, with the console getting into people’s hands on June 5th.</p>
