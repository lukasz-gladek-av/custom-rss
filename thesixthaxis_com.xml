		<p>The live-action film adaptation of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda</a> will debut in cinemas on 26th March 2027, Nintendo and production partner Sony Pictures have announced.</p>
<p>The news came via Nintendo’s freshly launched Nintendo Today news app, which was released during yesterday’s Nintendo Direct stream with the promise of daily news, game tidbits and other niceties. Just so long as you’ve signed in with a Nintendo Account.</p>


<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>Given that the Super Mario Bros. movie made $1.36 billion worldwide at the box office when it was released it is no surprise that Nintendo are turning The Legend Of Zelda into a film as well, though it’s likely to have a rather different audience. Even with a release date, there’s still a huge amount that we don’t know about the film’s production, such as who’s even being cast in the film, but being live action, it’s going to be difficult to shoehorn Chris Pratt in as Link or Zelda. Maybe he’ll be a Goron?</p>
