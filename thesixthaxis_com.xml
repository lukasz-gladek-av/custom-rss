		<p>Nintendo has released a fresh update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, with the headline feature for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2’s</a> biggest game being the addition of Team Battles to the Knockout Tour battle royale mode.</p>
<p>Knockout Tour throws 24-players into a continent-spanning race, knocking players out four at a time as you pass through regional checkpoints, until there’s just four racing for the finish line. With Team Battles in Knockout Tour, you can now set up a race with two to four teams for 12 v 12, 8 v 8 v 8 or 6 v 6 v 6 v 6 races.</p>


<p>With teams, players are still knocked out at checkpoints with the four lowest-placed racers dropping out, but instead of victory decided by the last player standing, points are now earned by team members based on their final placement – 50 points for first, 40 for second, 35 for third and 30 for fourth, before tailing off to get just 1 point for missing the first checkpoint. The team with the highest total wins overall, and that bonus for the top four will really help!</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t for the matchmade online multiplayer, but is instead a new custom variant that you can set up in a private room, either online or locally. If there are not enough players, then CPU drivers will fill the remaining spots.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Mario Kart World version 1.5.0 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added team races to Knockout Tour when playing in a room during “Online Play” and “Wireless Play”.</li>
<li>The game now supports the Polish language.
<ul>
<li>Note: You can change your selected language using the “Language” setting in the “System” menu of “System Settings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes end if a player plays as Kamek on Choco Mountain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the displayed rating would sometimes be incorrect when joining “Everyone” in “Online Play” while in a room.</li>
<li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
