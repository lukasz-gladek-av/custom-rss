		<p>Valve has released a new feature for Steam so people can discover games they may be interested in, as well as keeping an eye on games that they are already interested in. The new feature is the Personal Calendar, which displays games that have been recently released and is also populated with games that you may be interested in based on playtimes of similar users and the games they have been wishlisting. The feature is currently a Steam Labs experiment, so it will likely have changes made to it. You can check out your own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/personalcalendar?snr=1_2108_9__2107">calendar at the link.</a></p>
<p>The Personal Calendar only has Monday to Friday showing due to games rarely being released on weekends, and it will cover a rolling eight week period so it is not overwhelming. You can further customise the calendar to filter out different tags and determine how many game recommendations it is showing, with the default set to 100. It is also already populated with games that you have wishlisted, so you can see when a game you are wanting to play is going to be released. The recommendations themselves will be updated daily, but Valve does not see the recommended games changing too often due to the parameters that have been set. This is because as well as using similar profiles to provide recommendations, Steam will also take into account the games you are and have been playing, using the most played ones to populate the calendar too.</p>


<p>When it comes to the feedback Valve is looking for, the company has said, <em>“Really, we’re interested to know whatever feedback you may have about this experiment. Do you find this format of recommendations to be useful? What do you think about this new set of recommendations and calendar view? Are there other things we should include on the calendar? Does it seem to be generating good recommendations for you?”</em></p>

		<p>Paper Cult has announced that following feedback from players that played the Tears of Metal Steam Next Fest demo, the decision has been made to push the game’s release back. The new release window that has been given is Q1 2026, allowing the development team to take on board the feedback and use the additional time to polish up later parts of Tears of Metal.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Paper Cult Games said, <em>“First off, a massive thank you to everyone who played the demo, shared feedback, ideas, and reviews! Your support has been incredible, we’re honestly blown away. During Steam Next Fest, Tears of Metal climbed all the way to #16 in player count, earning a spot in Steam’s “50 Most-Played Demos of the October 2025 Event.” That’s huge for us and it’s all thanks to you!Even more heartwarming was earning the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review rating on the demo. It’s been an incredible boost to our morale, and we can’t wait to get the full game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>With all this momentum and plenty (or dare I say infinite) of new feedback in hand, we’ve decided to shift our release window to Q1 2026. We mostly want to take the extra time to polish the experience in the later part of the game. We promise, the wait will be worth it! Thanks again for marching with us. Your support truly gives us the final push to make Tears of Metal everything it deserves to be.”</em></p>

<p>Tears of Metal is a hack and slash co-op roguelike set in the Scottish Highlands. Hordes of enemies have invaded your home island, so it is up to you and your battalion of Scottish warriors to cleave through this vast number of soldiers to take back the island, and discover more about the Dragon Stone Meteor which caused the invasion to begin with. Tears of Metal has been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Galaxies Gaming Showcase, Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios have tempered expectations around the release date for Mouse: P.I For Hire, the 1930’s cartoon inspired first person shooter. A little while ago, the studio said that there would be a release date announcement for the game this weekend, but now that has changed with Mouse: P.I. For Hire now no longer releasing in 2025, but in early 2026 instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire - Troy Baker is Jack Pepper | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QhWXpfjBjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios said, <em>“Hey everyone. We know that you are excited for the release date announcement of Mouse: P.I. For Hire at the Galaxies Gaming Showcase this week 23 October. Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026. The support you have shown over the years has meant the world to us. Our single highest priority is for the game to deliver you the best possible experience, and this will help ensure we can live up to that goal. Thanks for everything and we will see you at Galaxies!”</em></p>
<p>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is due to be released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>
