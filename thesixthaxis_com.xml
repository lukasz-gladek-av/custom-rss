		<p>MicroProse and Not Knowing Software have finally confirmed the early access release date for the helicopter shooter Cleared Hot, and that date is November 20th. If you do not know about Cleared Hot, think of it as a new take on classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The new trailer for Cleared Hot which shows the kind of gameplay to expect, including shooting at enemies, dodging incoming fire, and using a magnet to wreak some havoc.</p>

<p>In a post, the development team stated why they chose the early access route, saying, <em>“We chose to do Early Access for 2 reasons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Letting the community guide the direction of the game</em></li>
<li><em>Give us the option to build more content as we go</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Without early access, we would be much more limited on the scope of what we can do. You guys have been really great at providing feedback, and I want that to continue as we expand the campaign. For now, we are launching with the first “chapter” of the campaign, which takes place in Texas. We are planning to do 2 additional chapters during early access, as well as expanding with side / contract missions. We will be posting an early access roadmap before launch, which will give some more info on what you can expect.”</em></p>

<p>The team also confirmed three more helicopters for the game including the Mi-24 Hind, the Bell 222 Sky Wolf, and the UH-1 Huey. Every helicopter in Cleared Hot will have its own stats, along with various upgrades to each one’s weapons, which are split between light and heavy. General upgrades will also be available for each helicopter model.</p>
