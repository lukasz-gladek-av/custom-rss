		<p>1047 Games is going to give it another shot, announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> beta will come to an end on 4th December, and that the online shooter will then get a full relaunch later in the month – I’d put some money on a launch during The Game Awards, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>In a simple announcement on Steam, the team writes, “Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.”</p>


<p>This will be Splitgate 2’s second launch, following the turbulent aborted release earlier this year. Having launched during Summer Game Fest in a fashion that put a lot of noses out of joint – namely, the studio founder calling out the industry while at the same time announcing a trend-chasing battle royale mode. Combined with a number of gameplay direction changes that didn’t appeal so strongly, and the game floundered, leading to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-goes-back-into-beta-original-splitgate-servers-going-offline-staff-cut/">1047 taking the game back to beta</a> and, more disappointingly, laying a bunch of people off.</p>
<p>So what’s changed? For the final targeted beta weekend 1047 outlined how they’ve adjusted the experience:</p>
<p><em>Since launching the beta in May, this game has majorly transformed. We started with factions and abilities, and we’ve rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.</em></p>

<p><em>Here’s what’s changed. We removed factions entirely and reimagined abilities as power-ups. We brought back classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch. We added Classic Arena, an even-starts mode that captures the spirit of original Splitgate. We’ve introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems constantly based on your feedback.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also added portal overloading and EMPs, fundamentally changing how map control works. We’ve streamlined equipment to improve combat clarity. We’ve tuned our controller feel. We’ve fixed critical bugs and made countless optimizations.</em></p>
<p><em>None of this happens without you. The past six months have been a journey, and every piece of feedback, every playtest participation, every community discussion has shaped where we are now. Splitgate is in the best place it’s ever been, and that’s because you’ve been here with us.</em></p>
<p>It certainly sounds like a major overhaul that gets back to the game and the genre’s roots a bit more. Splitgate 1 launched just before Halo Infinite and was massively popular for just being a bit like Halo’s classic arena shooter style and having a fun portals mechanic.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/arc-raiders-patch-1-4-0-rolls-out-with-some-content-and-bug-fixes/</link>
            <guid>1366483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Embark Studio has pushed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders </a>update 1.4.0 live, this smaller update focussed on content and bug fixes after the last two updates.</p>
<p>There’s some fixed lighting, a gun exploit that allowed it to be fixed more quickly by swapping to and fro, and they’ve ended an exploit that allowed all locked rooms to be opened.</p>


<p>Here’s the full ARC Raiders update 1.4.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.<wbr></li>
<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s much smaller than the last couple of updates, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/arc-raiders-update-1-2-0-is-called-north-line-adds-the-stella-montis-map/">1.2.0 adding the Stella Montis map</a> and a community challenge, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/arc-raiders-update-1-3-0-patch-notes-are-here-with-bug-fixes-and-balance-changes/">1.3.0 brought some balance tweaks</a> and had a more extensive set of bug fixes.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our review of ARC Raiders a few days ago. Tuffcub said, “Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</p>
