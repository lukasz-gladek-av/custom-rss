		<p>Nintendo has revealed everything that will feature in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and confirmed that it will launch on 26th March 2026.</p>

<p>Continuing their trend of making their game titles ludicrously long, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park” will arrive with a bunch of added content for the hit 2D platformer.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Starting with Bellabel Park, there’s two main plazas to explore with different gameplay offerings. The local multiplayer plaza features 17 co-op and competitive multiplayer games to try out, with up to four players able to take part, whether on a single console or through GameShare. The Game Room Plaza takes things even further with online and local wireless play and six different attractions. These are more ghost races, with up to eight players locally and twelve online.</p>

<p>The Toad Brigade is also found in Bellabel Park at Camp Central, giving you challenges to revisit the main adventure and, for example, race to collect all the coins in a level before time runs out. These can be played in 4 player co-op on one console. You’ll earn patches and rank up as you complete more challenges.</p>
<p>But there’s more! The Koopalings have returned and stolen the Bellabel flowers, spreading them across the Flower Kingdom and forcing you to go, track down the Koopalings and fight them.</p>
<p>Joining the platforming adventure is Rosalina for the first time, playable in both the main game and through Bellabel Park. Luma is also here, as a second player co-player, able to fly around, collect coins and spin attack at enemies – you can also use mouse controls for this. That’s alongside a new assist mode, which will stop you from taking damage and give you a propeller flower if you fall down a pit.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty significant expansion for the game, that’s for sure, and can be bought physically as a new release, or digitally with an upgrade available for existing owners.</p>
<p>I loved it with its original release. giving it a massive &lt;a href=”https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/”&gt;9/10&lt;/a&gt;, and saying, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder puts a fresh new spin on the classic Mario side-scroller with wild and trippy level transformations. It’s still Mario at its core, but it’s fun not knowing what to expect from each level. This could be the start of a bright new era for 2D Mario games.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nacon and Spiders have confirmed the full release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, the game exiting early access and launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWuflAxciDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay overview trailer runs through how the game has been designed, with a rich narrative to weave around your character, who has been ripped from the new world and taken back to the old, the companions that you can recruit, a look at the combat, and the blend of weapon and magical combat.</p>
<p>A good chunk of this is rather different to the original. GreedFall: The Dying World is a prequel to the first game, casting you as a Teer Fradee native, seeing how the colonial invaders are weaselling their corrupting ways into the land, before being whisked away from your home. A major difference is with the combat, which changes from an action RPG approach to the tactical pause style.</p>

<p>We recently had the chance to go hands on with an updated version of the game, and Steve came away much more intrigued than with his first attempt. He said, “All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bladesong Early Access Review – Forge your own adventure]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/bladesong-early-access-review-forge-your-own-adventure/</link>

		<p>I do feel as though I was born in the wrong era. For all that there was no medicine, that you brushed your teeth with twigs, and pillaging was a daily possibility, the simple, arable life that existed in medieval England still sounds like a lot less pressure than the modern day. Working the fields or raising livestock would be popular choices, but blacksmithing must have been the top pick at medieval careers day. Particularly for the less sporty kids who couldn’t swing a sword.</p>
<p>For all those ideas, Bladesong’s opening is somewhat more high-pressure than I was expecting. You awake on your deathbed. The elderly woman who’s nursing you pours water down your throat, and you find yourself selecting your own backstory, telling her where you’ve come from, what you carry with you, and what drives you to stay alive. Is it ambition, continuity or compassion that you believe in?</p>
<p><iframe title="Bladesong - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVZrvOBVEdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Bladesong’s narrative plays out as an old-school text adventure would, giving you prompts to choose from as you awaken, remembering your past and setting forth on a new beginning. It definitely tickled away at my gaming memory, selecting the option to ‘Get your bearings’ and being told, “You’re in a tent. There’s no sign of your caretaker, apart from a half-empty water pail and a damp cloth on your brow.” This is absolutely what games were like when I first discovered them, and that literary edge is put to good use in Bladesong’s opening, forming a clear vision of its fantasy medieval world and your place within it.</p>
<p>You are a blacksmith. A half-dead one, but a blacksmith, nonetheless. Each day, you’re offered a selection of commissions, and you’re able to choose which of these you take on, with new ones coming in the next morning. Each commission uses up resources, including Action Points, Steel, Leather and Wood, depending on the task set out in front of you. Alongside the cost, commissions also make specific requests about the type of blade you forge, and you have to try to make something that matches their specification.</p>


<p>The first customer that approaches you wants a sword that’s two-handed, asking for something, “Good and long. I don’t like my enemies to be in hugging distance.” There’s no other requirements here, but later commissions might ask for a sword that hits hard, or one that’s viciously sharp. You then select abilities to start shaping the blade.</p>
<p>You start each sword with a billet, a chunk of steel, that you then have to physically hammer and mould into shape. You select the right ability, and then hammer away with repeated clicks of the mouse to bash it into the correct form, with clicks at the top of the hammer’s apex resulting in harder blows. One after another, you hammer out the length, then flatten it to the right thickness and width, before shaping the end into a point and working on the blade’s cross section.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the blade into the correct shape, you need to add a hilt, a grip and a pommel, because, well, a sword without those things looks silly. That, and it’s much harder to hold. There’s various options within each of these additions, so you can tailor your wickedly sharp creations to both the owner and your own tastes as well.</p>
<p>Each commission has its own narrative context, and you begin to build a picture of this mud-strewn, dangerous place that you start the game in. As a new blacksmith, you slowly build up your position within the encampment, attempting to make your way into the city beyond, though your business model may cause the odd moral quandary when your customers are definitely going to shove your creations into another person’s gut.</p>
<p>Each time you complete a commission, you earn a portion of XP, and as with all good RPGs, once you’ve got enough you’ll level up. This then grants you skill points, which you can plough into the smithing skill tree, giving you access to advanced smithing, the ability to engrave your creations, or even start to work with curved blades. You can see all of these options from the off, so if there’s a particular creation you have in mind, you can choose to work your way along that branch before testing the others.</p>

<p>If you want to see the kind of things you’ll eventually be able to create, the Creative mode immediately gives you every single one of Bladesong’s tools and attachments to play with. There’s three pre-built examples for you to lovingly spin around in 3D which you can dismantle as well, swapping out parts and making changes as you see fit, before embarking on your own design project. If you attempt this at an early point in the Campaign’s narrative there’s a daunting array of options, but as you become more proficient, you’ll soon learn how to construct your perfect sword. The UI mostly does a good job of supporting you in that effort, though there’s a few rough edges to polish up through Early Access, like being able to easily apply different materials to your blade.</p>
<p>The painterly artwork for each location really helps set the scene, and they shift in front of you ever so slightly to make it feel as though you’re actually looking at them. It’s surprisingly effective, and a clever way for a smaller team to manifest a bigger, living world. The swordmaking display is similarly straightforward: an anvil, hammer and blade existing within a black void. I’d love to see this develop through Early Access into specific places, viewing your commissions in situ within your tent, or possibly founding your own smithy as you progress, but it definitely works well as it is.</p>
<p>ughij</p>
<p>There’s something very compelling at work in Bladesong. The sense of desperation, danger and destitution run through the opening hours of the Campaign with alarming force, and in some ways the smithing and swordmaking is simply the means to explore and experience more of this world. I love the writing, and the classic adventure threads that run through each moment really help to pull you onwards.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s the smithing sections that let you truly embody a medieval craftsman, and Bladesong gives you the physical and narrative tools to decide exactly who that craftsman is. You learn to balance your own creativity with what your customers want, and as you become more proficient with a hammer, you forge your own place in Bladesong’s world. It makes for a unique, thoughtful and utterly engaging experience that’s bound to find a legion of fans.</p>
