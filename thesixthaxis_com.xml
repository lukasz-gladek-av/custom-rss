		<p>Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will not be entering early access this year, developer Unfrozen has announced. The studio has stated that it will be making some changes to the game based on player feedback including changes to the user interface, and redesigning some of the units. Doing this will also allow Unfrozen to carry out more tests on Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era before it goes into early access, which is now slated for 2026.</p>

<p>On the plus side, those of you looking forward to Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era have the chance to play it now, with a new demo that has been released. This demo gives access to the tutorial, three single player modes including Arena, Classic (Multi Hero), and Single Hero. On top of that, those playing the demo will be able to choose from four of the six factions planned for Early Access. The four selectable factions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temple – Classic Humans</li>
<li>Necropolis – Undead and Vampires</li>
<li>Dungeon – Underground creatures and Dark Elves</li>
<li>Schism – Altered Elves and Eldritch Abominations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sylvan and Hive factions are not going to be playable. The demo for Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era has no time limit on it, so players can spend as much time as they want digging into what is available. The game itself is a prequel to the Heroes of Might and Magic games, with events from this release referenced in other games. The combat in Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will be turn based.</p>
