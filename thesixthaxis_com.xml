		<p>As is tradition, someone somewhere has published information a little too early about a game that is almost certainly going to be revealed later on tonight at The Game Awards. This year Lara Croft can take home not one, but two shiny “Someone pressed the TGA button to soon” awards as two Tomb Raider games have leaked.</p>
<p>The first is Tomb Raider Catalyst, which leaked artwork, synopsis, and the entire trailer, although Amazon has been very quick to take the latter down. It is set for release in 2027 for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and finds Lara on a new expedition across Northern India.</p>


<p><em>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst folows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.”</em></p>

<p>The second game, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a “reimagining” of the very first Lara Croft adventure.</p>

<p><em>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</em></p>
<p>If you really want to watch the trailer for that then you can find it in super low res with no sound over on 4chan, I suggest you don’t. I had a look on your behalf and it looks very much like the first Tomb Raider but all modern, so exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and both games are being made by Crystal Dynamics and published by Amazon.&nbsp; They are also making a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/04/sophie-turner-is-lara-croft-in-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series/">Tomb Raider TV series</a> with &nbsp;Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role.</p>
<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>

		<p>Have you been keen to step into the 3D meat space of Super Meat Boy 3D? Well there’s no need to wait for PC gamers, as a Super Meat Boy 3D demo is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3288210/Super_Meat_Boy_3D/">live on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Coming as a slight precursor to The Game Awards tonight, this is a newly updated version of the demo that was playable at Gamescom earlier this year.</p>


<p>The Super Meat Boy 3D demo features 10 levels from the full game, giving a look at two worlds –&nbsp;the squirrel-infested Forest and the trash-filled Wastes. Of course, this will be just a taster, an apertif for what’s in store, which is laid out by the following blurb:</p>
<p><em>Super Meat Boy 3D is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar—IN 3D! You’ll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way—IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before—IN (say it with me!) 3D!</em></p>
<p>Yup, there’s boss fights in this one.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a PC, or want to save the experience for later, hopefully you won’t have to wait too long. Super Meat Boy 3D coming in early 2026 to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and coming day one to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>
