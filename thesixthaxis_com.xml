		<p>If games were rated on visuals alone, Absolum would be a surefire winner. This is one great-looking game; like a Saturday Morning cartoon by way of Mike Mignola’s Hellboy, it’s immediately eye-catching with bold black lines, bright colouring and gorgeously animated characters, all set against a distinctive dark fantasy backdrop.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that it looks good should come as little surprise when you learn that Guard Crush and Dotemu are involved. Both developer and publisher have become synonymous with bold, evocative 2D artwork, ably demonstrated by the stunning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> from a few years ago. Absolum is, quite clearly, a feast for the eyes.</p>


<p>Fans of Streets of Rage 4 also will be heartened to learn that this is a beat ‘em up. You stride confidently from left to right while despatching legions of monsters, our hands-on seeing us take control of a pair of Wizards: Galandra, an elven swordswoman and Karl, a dwarf with knuckledusters and a blunderbuss.</p>
<p>Combat feels awesome. Every punch or sword swing has bags of weight behind it, with regular attacks lined up behind more powerful special abilities – in Karl’s case, a headbutt. It feels familiar – it’s hard not to for a beat ‘em up in 2025 – but that familiarity doesn’t matter so much when everything here is tuned to perfection.</p>

<p>vgujhb</p>
<p>As you punch and wallop your enemies, you build up Mana, which you can then unleash via each character’s Arcana. This is a special move that can blast multiple enemies out of the way, helping you to clear the area around you, and grab a little breathing space, at least for a moment.</p>
<p>You’ve set out to free Uchawi the Mother. A pregnant embodiment of spirit and nature, she’s been captured by Azra, the Sun King, who is set on controlling all magic, his devices feeding from Mother’s essence. Once you release her, your character gains access to Rituals. This is your first taste of the Roguelike aspects of the game, with each Ritual point letting you choose between two different abilities. Initially, you choose between adding fire to your regular attacks or creating a burning ring around you that damages enemies, and the whole process allows you to tailor your character’s abilities through your playthrough.</p>
<p>That is, of course, at the whims of RNG, and there are also different families of Ritual, including fire and water, to choose between. There may also be additional bonuses for equipping abilities from the same class, enhanced further by equipment known as Trinkets that you can pick up along the way. You can immediately see the opportunity for exciting builds, giving players plenty of reason to experiment with different Rituals and Trinkets.</p>
<p>Being a Roguelike, death is somewhat inevitable, and when you fall at the hands of Azra, you’re brought back to life in Mother’s sanctuary, a place of rest, relaxation and contemplation. Here you can level up, check out artefacts you’ve found, and prepare for the next run, and it’s another beautifully presented place that helps to cement the game’s world, and the lore around it.</p>
<p>The world of Talamh isn’t small. There’s a huge map to explore, collecting artefacts and levelling up, all in a bid to become powerful enough to beat Azra and his Crimson Order. You choose your path through this land, coming up against boss characters at points that punctuate the action with a serious step up in challenge, with the reward being new Rituals and improved abilities.</p>
<p>This is such an inviting world. The environmental design is packed with detail, capturing the decaying, ruined landscape in a way that’s consistently intriguing. Alongside that, the different enemies, and the two main characters included here, just look fantastic, and you want to get further just to see what’s around the corner.</p>

<p>As with all good Roguelikes, death is not an entirely bad thing. Your progress gains you Radiance, alongside other materials, that you can use to further level up your character, improving various stats, enhancing their abilities, and giving you more chance at success the next time around.</p>
<p>The humble beat ’em up has seen an incredible resurgance in recent years, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/02/river-city-girls-review/">River City Girls</a> through to a bevy of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</a> games. Guard Crush and Dot Emu have been at the forefront of that, and that alone makes Absolum worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.</p>

		<p>While most gamers will recognise Ninja Gaiden through its full 3D entries from the original Xbox and beyond the series actually began way back in 1988 on the NES (and arcade). The first games were released in Europe as Shadow Warriors with the iconic name being used worldwide with the turn to 3D. While these earlier games are a very different beast to the modern ones they do share one key characteristic – they are hard as nails. Before Dark Souls became the shorthand for difficult games it was Ninja Gaiden that held the sadistic crown. Ragebound can continue this trend if you want it to but also contains a more streamlined difficulty setting that is perfect for learning the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/II9CmTRac8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ragebound is developed by The Game Kitchen, most famous for their fantastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/10/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a> titles. These games had a similar hardcore approach but functioned more as search adventures than straight-forward action platformers. When the developers were announced, there was some speculation that Ninja Gaiden might be taking the turn towards backtracking and levelling up but I can happily report that the new game feels as close to a modern take on the originals as you can get. I tested this by playing through the original on Switch Online but haven’t finished it yet – did I mention that it was hard?</p>


<p>The modern graphics have a great sense of style while still being in keeping with the original. The sprites resemble a modern update of the best of 16-bit aesthetics, featuring colourful environments and hordes of demons to fight. Special mention needs to be made for the soundtrack too, which has some of the best rocking game music you’ll hear. I can’t wait to check out the full track list when it releases and anticipate it making an appearance on my shuffle play for quite a while to come.</p>
<p>Chronologically, Ragebound fits in alongside the first Ninja Gaiden game, in which long-running protagonist Ryu Hayabusa travels to America to honour his father’s will. This is shown through an introductory cutscene that serves to establish new hero Kenji Mozu whilst also setting up a nice tongue-in-cheek counter to initial complaints about the change in character. Functionally, Kenji is similar to Ryu but with a shock of ginger hair to give much-needed representation to us carrot tops (technically it’s only my beard that’s ginger, but that still counts!).</p>


<p>Unlike the more realistic urban 1980s environment of much of the original game, Ragebound starts off in a timeless Japanese village being attacked by demons. The supernatural enemy here allows for a lot more range in foes than the thugs and ninjas and some are suitably grotesque and challenging. Alongside your standard sword attack, some enemies will provide a necessary supercharge to your weapon, which is needed to quickly defeat shielded enemies and barriers, offering a nice element of strategy. Secondary throwable weapons are also available when you have enough ninja charge which are useful for picking off tricky enemies or inflicting quick damage on bosses. Most interesting of all is the ability to bounce on enemies and projectiles which feels very in keeping with the Blasphemous titles but utilised in a more traditional platforming game.</p>
<p>The demo I played included the first level and also a couple of later ones showing an extra gameplay mechanic in which Kenji seems to have been fused with another mysterious character whom he can call on to explore a shadowy alternative world that interacts with the main one. This adds an environmental puzzle aspect to these levels that is really interesting, although I do question how much it’ll break the flow of the action.</p>
<p>Once the demo levels are beaten a hard mode is unlocked that plays a lot more like the original in terms of enemy challenge and infrequent checkpoints. This promises to be a suitable challenge for those looking for that, and I’m intrigued to see whether this stays as an unlockable or if it’ll be open to choose as a first play experience.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is an absolute blast and really manages to combine the past and present to produce a game that looks and controls brilliantly. The added hard mode continues the legacy of the series, whilst the standard one feels more accessible to newcomers (or oldies like me whose reactions aren’t what they used to be). When the full game comes out, it promises to be a real standard bearer for traditional 2d arcade platformers, and I am champing at the bit to get my hands on it.</p>
