		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is set to arrive this week on 15th May, adding a “hardcore difficulty” boss rush modes to the game. But that’s not all, as developer Neople has also previewed what to expect in updates through June.</p>
<p>The 15th May update will add two boss rush modes to address the desire for a hardcore difficulty. Instead of just being hard for hard’s sake, Creative Director Junho Lee explained,”It had to be fun, something that’s tough but rewarding. A mode you’d be proud to conquer and eager to show off.”</p>


<p>The update will add a new Boss Rush (Ultimate Challenge) menu on the title screen after beating the main campaign. The two Boss Rush modes have different difficulty and progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“Great General’s Crucible”</b> – Fight through groups of thematically organized bosses, unlocking the next theme each time you clear one. You’ll fight with designated specs (gear, level, skills, etc.), and completing all of them will earn you a special reward.</li>
<li><b>“Berserker’s Bloodshed”</b> – Make your character stronger with rewards earned from consecutive fights, and push all the way to defeat the final boss. As a final reward, you can earn powerful new weapons and set items.</li>
</ul>
<p>The update will also let you change your appearance in the main game once you’ve completed the Blacksmith’s Heirloom mission.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, an update projected for late May or early June will add some quality of life features to help address requests for shortcut resets and faster boss retries. In the traditional sense, Neople determined that the game structure would not allow straight up fulfilment of those requests. Instead they will implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New items added to allow fast traveling to the Crevice or the last Blade Nexus you interacted with:</b> We’ll be adding items that let you instantly move to the Crevice or to the last Blade Nexus you interacted with. These will be provided as permanent items, not consumables.</li>
<li><b>Added teleport between from one Blade Nexus to another:</b> You’ll be able to freely move from one Blade Nexus to another activated in the same mission. Interacting with a Blade Nexus will display a list of available destinations.</li>
<li>After clearing certain <b>missions for farming purposes, you will now start right in front of the Spectral Portal</b> before entering that mission. You’ll no longer have to travel long distances through the Mortal World for a quick retry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, targeting late June, Neople are working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Skill balance adjustments for Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear</li>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Adjustment to set effect configurations</li>
<li>[New System] Skill Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Gear Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Increase Gear Grades</li>
<li>[New System] Change Weapon Scaling</li>
<li>[QoL] New Sorting Option: Sorting Items by Name</li>
<li>[QoL] Storage Expansion</li>
<li>And… More Special Contents Coming</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot more detail and explanation of the development choices <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543356943483274341">by Junho Lee on the Steam announcement page</a>, but there’s the cliff notes.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is an enjoyable game that we awarded 8/10 back in March. Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/the-first-berserker-khazan-review/">our review</a> that it’s “not reinventing anything by any means, but is consistently fun to play. The visuals are lovely, the action is a lot of fun thanks to ever-evolving skill trees, and the boss designs are great too. If you’re after a Soulslike challenge, it can fit that bill in some ways, but it should also have a broader appeal thanks to the easy mode and more.”</p>
