		<p>There’s a fresh new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, showcasing the new Z-A Battle Club with up-to four player battles. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Z-A Battle Club completely mixes up the traditional flow of Pokémon battling that you’ve known since the very first games, putting a three minute timer in place and tasking everyone with knocking out as many opposing Pokémon as possible! The trainers who strike the finishing blow will earn a point, with the defeated trainer respawning back at the edge of the arena with another one of their Pokémon ready to go, though you can still switch Pokémon for a tactical change.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to Pokémon Legends: Z-A now having real time battles where you can move around the combat arena. It also make area of effect attacks much more impactful, such as when Mega Dragonite is summoned and unleashes a meteor strike to wipe out all three opponents at once in the final ten seconds.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>&nbsp;on 16th October.</p>
