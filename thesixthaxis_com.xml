		<p>Coming from the creator of Turbo Overkill, the survival horror Total Chaos is no longer “coming soon”, it’s out now! Total Chaos is available for PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s a day one game for Xbox Game Pass as well. Steam VR support is expected to arrive in Q2 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total Chaos | Available Now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oMPaRnaiig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s an impressive trailer for the game, with some deeply unsettling visuals and perspectives, playing out as a first person horror and lookin to blend both classic and modern horror sensibilities together. </p>
<p>Across the 9 chapters journey through to the heart of Fort Oasis, along the way you’ll be able to lean on both melee and ranged weapons, building new weapons from scrap and scavenging as you go. </p>
<p>Your journey will also be accompanied by a soundtrack that features a new original theme from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, and an ambient soundtrack from composers Jason Dagenet &amp; William Braddell, and Apogee’s Tim Stoney, Chipper Hammond, and Mathieu Hallouin.</p>

<p>Total Chaos has its roots in a modern Doom II total conversion. First conceptualised by Sam in 2008 and then developed from 2012 through 2018, Total Chaos has now been completely rebuilt as a fully standalone experience, and expanded from six chapters to nine.</p>

		<p>Eclipse Glow Games shared a big long look at their upcoming action-adventure game, a spectacular visual feast of a boss battle that’s inspired by Arthurian Legend. The game is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there’s no date set just yet. </p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | &quot;Break the Mirror&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Players will step into the role of Gwendolyn, with this boss battle seeing her face off against the witch Tyronoe through multiple realms. This is a Dual Frontline battle, where you battle through a mirrored, folded realm as both Gwendolyn and the knight Sir Lamorak.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on throughout, from shattering the divide between worlds, to fighting on a lake and within its reflective surface, and to a big fiery ball that you need to blow up before it’s too late. </p>
<p>It really is quite special as a visual showcase, built within Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>I also find that it’s quite a satisfying turnabout for the usual game creation tale of Western developers looking to Asian mythology and history for inspiration. Eclipse Glow Games is a Chinese studio that’s borrowed from British myths instead, setting Tides of Annihilation in a devastated and distorted version of London, following an Outworld invasion, and crossing over to the mythical realm of Avalon. </p>

		<p>What next for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer Poncle? Well, more Vampire Survivors, kind of. Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard is a first person dungeon crawler with a streak of playing tons and tons of cards from your hand.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and it’ll be a day one game into Game Pass. It’s expected for release in 2026, but poncle just say it’ll be along when it’s good and ready.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Crawlers coming day one with Xbox Game Pass in 2026 | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-b6dkZH6XSo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Speaking on Xbox Wire, Poncle founder Luca said, “This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs! The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff! With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on something, but we’re not talking about that just yet.”</p>
<p>Such a tease!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>IO Interactive shared a little glimpse of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview stream today, showing off about the car in the game… the Aston Martin Valhalla.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Aston Martin Valhalla Reveal | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0wLsLm8OlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Valhalla is stuffed with F1 technology and really slots into the supercar category in a way that probably feels a bit excessive for a spy, even of Bond’s stature. You’ll have to earn the number first, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all a little bit of a let down when thinking this would be a bigger gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>
<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

		<p>Mintrocket’s diving and sushi bar running sensation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver,</a> is out now for Xbox Series X|S, arriving as an Xbox Play Anywhere title that also nets you the game on PC via Microsoft and Xbox Cloud. This means you can play it on the Xbox ROG Ally X and Xbox Series after buying it once, which is nice.</p>
<p>Then, coming in early 2026, is a new expansion for the game that will take Dave over to the jungle. It’s quite simply called Into The Jungle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dave the Diver - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFbcVdZRKwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s been a couple years now since Dave the Diver arrived on PC. It was honoured with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/27/game-of-the-year-2023-best-pc-game-steam-deck/">Best PC Game award in our 2023 Game of the Year awards</a>, with Dom saying, <em>“With Dave the Diver you should prepare to be constantly surprised. On the surface, this is a game about diving with a portly man called Dave. You know he’s out of shape because everyone comments on it within the opening moments of the game, but it soon becomes clear that this is a man, and a game, with hidden depths.”</em></p>
