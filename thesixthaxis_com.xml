		<p>Developer DON’T NOD has released a brand new trailer for its sci-fi adventure, which is due to be released in 2026. The brand new trailer confirms a second playable character to provide a different perspective to Ariane, and that new character is fellow astronaut Thomas. The two characters have different ways of dealing with things, with Ariane being more physical as she moves around while Thomas uses his mind to piece things together due to picking up an injury.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aphelion | Hide to Survive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oUUnfGffCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer for Aphelion also shows a creature native, named The Nemesis, to the planet Persephone stalking both astronauts, who cannot fight back. Both Ariane and Thomas will need to hide and move stealthily to avoid detection. Ariane and Thomas are not together in this journey but are looking for each other after crashing onto the planet of Persephone.</p>
<p>Aphelion is due to be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

		<p>Tower survivor roguelite Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has been given a release date by Ludogram and Raw Fury, with the game coming on November 20th. There is a demo available on Steam, which will remain available even after the game is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road you need to defend a moving city from an endless army of monsters that want to tear the city down. To fight back, you need to gather resources like wood, stone, and gold to use to invest in defences, upgrades, and abilities to take on threats from small monsters to big bosses.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters are Coming! so it’s time to get this addictive Tower-Survivor rolling</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, Stefan wrote, <em>“Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.”</em></p>

<p>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road will be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, it has been verified for Steam Deck and the Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

		<p>The Adepta Sororitas are coming to dish out the Emperor’s justice in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, with the boomer shooter sequel letting you choose between the returning Space Marine Malum Caedo, and new character Nyra Veyrath, one of the Sisters of Battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 - Sister of Battle Extended Cut Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MAMOJqgiaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sisters of Battle are more than capable of holding their own in battle, despite having nowhere near the augmentations of the Adeptus Astartes – it’s all mad religious fervour and zeal powering their combat prowess.</p>
<p>In Boltgun 2, Nyra doesn’t have the same level of armour as a Space Marine, but she’s much more agile and can use speed, precision and just setting everything on fire to get ahead.</p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving you a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>
