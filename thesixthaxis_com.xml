		<p>Krafton has announced PUBG: Blindspot is the new name for their upcoming 5v5 top-down tactical shooter, codenamed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-arc">Project ARC</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the rebrand and a new gameplay trailer, they’ve also confirmed that PUBG: Blindspot will have a playable demo during Steam Next Fest, starting on 21st February.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The name’s a pretty good one, to be honest. Blindspot pulls the camera out to give a birds eye view of the level, but shows and hides enemies from view depending on cones of vision that are blocked and obscured by the level scenery and layout. Vision is a shared resource, though, so you get to see what the rest of your team can, helping to coordinate your efforts.</p>
<p>Blindspot currently has two game modes: a straight up Team Deathmatch, and the main mode that is called Demolition – a straight up riff on Search &amp; Destroy, where teams attack or defend an attempt to plant a bomb, with team eliminations also enabled.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this late last year, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Commandos: Origins gets a sneaky April release date]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-gets-a-sneaky-april-release-date.1102995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/commandos-origins-gets-a-sneaky-april-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Commandos: Origins has a new release date on 9th April 2025, Kalypse Media and developer Claymore Game Studios have confirmed, but that’s just the beginning.</p>
<p>9th April is the digital release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a>, which is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC – and day one for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> – with a retail release across those three platforms then coming on 22nd May. Later in 2025, the game is also being released for PS4 and Xbox One.</p>


<p>There’s even more complexity with versions and pricing. The Digital Standard Edition is $49.99 | €49.99 | £45.99 on PC and $59.99 | €59.99 | £49.99 on consoles. A Digital Deluxe Edition, which includes skins from Commandos 2, a 3D printing template for the Green Beret, a digital calendar and the original soundtrack, will cost $59.99 | €59.99 | £54.99 on PC and $69.99 | €69.99 | £59.99 on consoles.</p>
<p>If you hang about for the physical retail release, though, this will include all the Deluxe Edition contents for the Standard Edition pricing – $49.99 | €49.99 | £45.99 on PC and $59.99 | €59.99 | £54.99 on consoles.</p>
<p>Have I made that complicated enough for you?</p>

<p>Set before the original games in the series, Commandos: Origins plainly promises to tell the origin stories of the Commandos and how they were united for their very first missions.&nbsp;Green Beret, Sapper and the rest of the gang will be taking on 10 high stakes missions from the Arctic to Africa.</p>
<p>It’s coming up on two decades since the series’ heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but it’s always been considered a cult classic, with tough as nails missions and plenty of tactical shenanigans to get up to. Interest has been rekindled in recent times thanks to HD remasters and console ports of Commandos 2 and Commandos 3 in 2020 and 2022 respectively.</p>
<p>Original studio Pyro is long gone, but current IP owner Kalypso Media previously commissioned Raylight Games for the HD remasters. For this new entry in the game – which is effectively a series reboot – they’ve partnered with&nbsp;Claymore Game Studios to develop.</p>

		<p>I’ve had an exciting week of playing things I’m not allowed to tell you about yet, but what I can tell you about is the awesome time I’ve been having. 2025 feels like it’s going to be a good year for game fans, and there’s lots of exciting stuff on the way in both Early Access and the wider world.</p>
<p>I’ve covered my bedside table in handhelds in the last week, hopping into Citizen Sleeper 2 on ROG Ally, Puzzle and Dragons Z on the 3DS, Soul Calibur on the Retroid Pocket 2, and the Riki 8-Bit Collection on Nintendo Switch. There is barely room for my books and a brew, stacking them up in an unwieldly and potentially dangerous way. So far, there hasn’t been disaster. So far…</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 this week, buoyed by the new update (which temporarily broke things) and working away on our review of Robobeat. Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> is still in Japan so has had no gaming at all. Keeping us up to date on his trip, he told us, “I have visited Kanazawa, Hiroshima, and currently in Kyoto. Unfortunately this time next week my holiday will be over.” Sorry that the real world beckons, Aran!</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been working on a very special project these last few months, and him and Jim are starting to lift the lid on it! He tells us, “Jim and I gear up to crowd fund the Playing with History book, I’ve been playing a bunch of games with a historical or mythological setting to gather ideas for articles. One of those is Immortals: Rise of Fenyx. I’d bounced off the game on its release but I’ve been thoroughly enjoying playing it in 2025! A pitch perfect interpretation of the Ancient Greek gods, hugely entertaining combat, satisfying puzzles to solve, actually funny; it all adds up to a great open world game!”</p>


<p>When he’s not been working with Ade, <strong>Jim</strong> has continued to creep around in the weird world of Alan Wake II. He says, “I’ve just hit the point of no return and while I’m keen to see how the rest of the story plays out (and wrap up any DLC) it’s been a bit of a mixed bag, overall. The combat gameplay is still weak and cool elements such as the Mind Palace and Case Board aren’t used to their full potential. There are also times where the game feels a little too self indulgent with looping/meandering sections that remind me of the worst parts of Control. At the same time, I’m glad we have games like Alan Wake II.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has occasionally been angry with his games this week, but not much of that was directed at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. He tells us, “I’ve also tried High on Life, which is exactly what you expect except the shooting is surprisingly competent, and I’m slogging through the shocking embarrassment that is Dragon Age The Veilguard. No wonder Mike Laidlaw left the dev, must’ve been like watching a CEO drown his child.” You may, perhaps, be able to tell where his anger has come from.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> also played some Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, doing the legwork for our review video. Once that had been wrapped up, he made a start on Avowed, where he’s going to do the same trick for our review of that. He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/spider-man-2-pc-review/">Spider-Man 2 on PC</a>, finding things to be generally solid if you’re shooting for PS5-like quality.</p>
<p>How about you, what have you played?</p>
