		<p>Ubisoft have posted a picture of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell on their official Twitter feed along with a pair of eyes, some lips and the tag #SplinterCell.&nbsp; The series has been a favourite of fans for many years but the last game was Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist which launched in 2013, so it’s about time for a new game, right?</p>
<p>Well, probably not, in fact it’s perhaps more about Lady Gaga as she is headlining Tudum, Netflix’s yearly fan show that highlights up-and-coming films and tv series. You will have almost certainly forgotten that in July 2020 Netflix and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/">announced an animated show based on the game.</a> The Ubisoft post on Twitter is just ahead of this year’s Tudum, which will start at 1am BST on May 31st, 2025.</p>


<p>At the time a report on Variety suggested that two seasons comprising sixteen episodes in total had been greenlit. Derek Kolstad, who is one of the key writers behind the John Wick films. had been linked as an executive producer and writer for the series.</p>
<p>A trailer for the series was released eight months ago, you can watch it below.</p>

<p>However, there’s a small chance Ubisoft are going to reveal something about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">Splinter Cell Remake</a> that they announced way back in 2021 and have not said a thing about since then.</p>

<p><em>“Ubisoft has greenlit the development of a Splinter Cell remake that will draw from the rich canvas of the brand. Led by Ubisoft Toronto, the game will be rebuilt from the ground up using Ubisoft’s own Snowdrop engine – the same engine being used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, as well as Ubisoft’s upcoming Star Wars game – to deliver new-generation visuals and gameplay, and the dynamic lighting and shadows the series is known for.”</em></p>
<p>Creative Director Chris Auty, Producer Matt West, and Technical Producer Peter Handrino took to the Ubisoft to answer some questions.</p>
<p>“A lot of time has passed since the original Splinter Cell, and even since the last sequel – enough time to miss an entire console generation,” explains Peter. “So now we’re going to take the time to explore what this means for us, for light and shadow, for animation tech, for gameplay, AI, even audio. We’re going to ask ourselves, “where does it make sense for us to innovate?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to be straddling the line between the spirit of the old, and the comfort of the new, so that we can excite and surprise new players, but also make sure that when our returning players pick up the controller, they have that sigh of relief, saying “Ahhh, they got it.”” concludes Matt.</p>

		<p>CD Projekt RED has revealed that it will be releasing another update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt later this year, and that this update will add cross platform mod support. This update will allow players to create and share mods across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with all mods being available as free content. The release of this update is part of the celebration of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s 10th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — 10th Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The mod update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will require a little bit of work from players to use. If you want to access mods you will need to set up an account on<a href="https://mod.io/">&nbsp;mod.io</a> and link your CD Projekt RED account to it. Those on PC can still use the likes Nexus Mods and Steam Workshop, but console players will need to sign up to mod.io to use the modding function. Additionally, if mods are being created that use scripts will require REDkit too, but mods that change things like textures will not require REDkit. Mods will not be creatable on PS5 and Xbox Series XS.</p>
<p>A release date for the mod support update for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is yet to be confirmed.</p>
