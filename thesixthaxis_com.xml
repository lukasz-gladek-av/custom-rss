		<p>Blizzard has announced that WarCraft Rumble will not be getting anymore new content, though there will still be support to address bugs and in game events. While it is not explicitly stated, this move could be another fallout from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">mass layoffs affecting all divisions</a> that Microsoft enacted yesterday. The biggest hits of that was the closure of The Initiative and the cancellations of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Perfect Dark.</a> Everwild has also cancelled and there have been layoffs at Rare, Turn 10, and Halo Studios too.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard said,<em> “We have an important update on the future of Warcraft Rumble. After much deliberation, we’ve arrived at an extremely hard decision. Moving forward, we’ll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.  </em></p>
<p><em>Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team—some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with. Since launch, Rumble has struggled to find its footing relative to our ambition for its long-term success, and for some time now the team has been listening to player feedback, refocusing in certain areas, and exploring different options. Some of that work showed signs of progress, but ultimately wasn’t enough to put the game on a path to sustainability.  </em></p>
<p><em>During this transition, we are focused on supporting our teammates. We’re deeply grateful to everyone at Blizzard and in the community for helping bring Warcraft Rumble to life and embracing the joy that makes this game so special. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us.”</em></p>

<p>The Microsoft job cuts yesterday lead to 9,000 people losing their jobs across the company. We hope everyone impacted is able to find new roles soon. If you have been affected check out<a href="https://gamejobs.co/">&nbsp;GameJobs.co</a> for roles available in game dev.</p>

		<p>Two key parts of the creative team on HBO’s The Last of Us TV series have stepped away from the production ahead of Season 3. Neil Druckmann is leaving to focus on his work at Naughty Dog and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-next-big-game/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while the Last of Us Part 2 co-writer Halley Gross is also leaving the writer’s room.</p>
<p>Druckmann writes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/druckmann/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">social media</a>:</p>


<p><em>“I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative. </em></p>
<p><em>“Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">Gross says</a>:</p>

<p><em>“With great care and consideration, I’ve decided to take a step back from my day-to-day work on HBO’s The Last of Us to make space for what comes next. I’m so appreciative of how special this experience has been. Working alongside Neil, Craig, HBO, and this remarkable cast and crew has been life changing. The stories we told – about love, loss, and what it means to be human in a terrifying world&nbsp;are exactly why I love this franchise.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have some truly rad projects ahead that I can’t wait to share, but for now, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who brought Ellie and Joel’s world to life with such care.”</em></p>
<p>This leaves the show entirely in the hands of Craig Mazin to produce, direct and lead the writing of the last two seasons of the show. He had already shouldered the bulk of the adaptation through the first two seasons of The Last of Us, the sole writer on 11 of the 16 episodes released so far, with Druckmann writing one himself, and broader collaborations for the Season 1 opening and finale, and the final two episodes of Season 2.</p>
<p>The announcement has left viewers and fans of the game and show a bit unsure of how to feel. Similar to The Last of Us Part II as a video game, the narrative direction that featured in Season 2 of the TV series was less universally beloved than the first, but beyond still controversial narrative choices, it also had to contend with telling only a part of the second game’s story. In general, many are happy that Druckmann is able to focus his efforts on the Intergalactic, but there’s less consensus over Mazin’s adaptation of the second game.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
