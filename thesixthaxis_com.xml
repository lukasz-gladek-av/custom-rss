		<p>It’s always fun getting a big new console launch, and while the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hasn’t sparked quite as much excitement as the PS4 Pro, thanks in no small part to the price, it’s still an interesting bit of kit. I’ve still only scratched the surface with our review unit so far, but am pulling together the various gameplay comparisons that we need for our review. So I’ve played lots of games in 10 minute sections, then changes some graphics settings and done it again, then switched console and done it again…</p>
<p>It has been…. repetitive, with my only respite coming in the hour-long session I had with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">Project ARC</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s jump on over to the much more interesting gaming that everyone else has been getting up to. <strong>Ade</strong> has played a little bit of Helldivers 2, has been reviewing Redacted, but has mainly spent a very complicated game of real life Tetris as he puts his life in boxes so that he can move house next week – “It’s stressful and confusing and I really can’t recommend. ????”</p>
<p>All the best with the move!</p>


<p>There’s much less moving and shaking for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s been locked in on Black Ops 6 multiplayer – “My combat report is showing a much improved kill/death ratio now that I’m starting to memorise map layouts and get to grips with the speedier player movement. There are some things about COD that never change, however, with squad mates completely ignoring objectives so they can work on their killstreaks being one of them. Still, I’m having an immense amount of fun and can’t wait for the first big content drop.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been on the Final Fantasy XVI warpath still, grabbing all the DLC and completing Echoes of Fallen already. He’s now moving on to the Rising Tide DLC, and found the new powers to be rather handy. He also dipped a toe back into Hydrophobia: Prophecy for a look back feature, and started replaying the wonderful Tearaway on his Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> loves three kinds of games: monster games, card games and walking around games. So… he’s obviously been playing a lot of Pokémon TCG Pocket this week, while enjoying all the delights of having a 6-month old. “Great little game that’s fun to dip in and out of. I’m considerig writing a review this afternoon (if I can find the time).”</p>

<p>As for our resident horror acolyte, <strong>Steve</strong>? Well, he was naturally on hand for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/">Slitterhead</a>, “a game that will definitely find a cult following but had too many issues for me to rate it as highly as I thought I would from the style alone. I think it’ll be one of those (like the recently remastered Shadows of the Damned) that’ll be the spur for lots of retrospectives and YouTube video essays and I’ll almost certainly be doing something with it academically regarding the setting and blood powers.</p>
<p>And then he has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/mario-luigi-brothership-review/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> arriving today for a total change of pace on some upcoming commutes.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Phasmophobia some more, “which takes ages to get to grips with because there’s too many ghosts, but is still fun in a deeply scary way. Doesn’t help that there’s only two of us playing either.”</p>

<p>And rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> had a bloody great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro Awakening in PSVR 2</a>, which had him so wrapped up in the terror and suspense that his flatmate was shouting at him to stop screaming!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>
