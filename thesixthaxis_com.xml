		<p>EA have announced that there will not be an F1 game launching next year and instead, F1 25 will be getting paid DLC.&nbsp; “The decision to offer a premium content update for F1 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” they explain.</p>
<p>The 2026 DLC will “bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,”&nbsp; but no other details have been revealed. The next game in 2027 is going to refresh the franchise so it “looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.”</p>


<p>“F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport. With Formula 1’s momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future<em>. </em>We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world,” adds Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> was enhanced with a DLC pack that was inspired by F1 The Movie, the&nbsp;content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>
