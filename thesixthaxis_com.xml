			<p>We’re back. Your loadout is prepared with power armour, Chainguns and Roadie Runs readied, and Sera is under attack again, but where there was once the reassuring feel of an Xbox controller in your hand, you look down to find a PlayStation 5 DualSense instead. Is this some Locust trick? No, this is gaming in 2025, and while it’s likely proof that the console wars are basically over, Marcus Fenix can never rest, with a new battleground to protect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: Reloaded | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is the original Gears game, but tugged, tightened and scrubbed up to fit into a newer, shinier suit of armour, ready for battle on the enemy console. For the veteran, there’s not a whole lot to find, pulling together the additional campaign act from the original PC release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/25/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-review/">the 2015 Ultimate Edition</a>, alongside all of the previous DLC, and there’s cross-platform play as well as cross-save.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, though, it’s only cross-save across the brand-new Reloaded version of the game, as opposed to any other rendition of this game. It’s the kind of thing Fenix would shrug at, and so should you, but I found it a little odd that the cross-save is a feature limited to this outing, when Xbox gamers will have played it a number of times.</p>


<p>At this point, I could genuinely reload a Lancer in my sleep – assuming you only have to hit a shoulder button at the right time to do so. I’ve played through this campaign more times than I can count, but it still hits the same beats, still ramps up the drama, and is still capable of putting you on the back foot, especially on the higher difficulty settings.</p>
<p>The steady stream of iconic moments, from your first steps through the city, the fight through darkened alleyways filled with avian Kryll, or luring a Berzerker through narrow corridors, are as much of an adrenaline rush as ever. We don’t see many of these types of shooters anymore, and in the absence of modern or even remastered Killzone and Resistance, there’s a welcoming little slot on PlayStation that I think Gears will fit nicely into.</p>
<p>Multiplayer will play a large part in that, and co-op and competitive play is still a massive part of the gung-ho Gears experience. Adding in cross-play to bolster the community should mean that there’s always someone to play with or against, though I have to wonder how newcomers will fare against a legion of players who’ve been honing their reloads and shotgun blasts for the best part of twenty years. If you’ve got the tech, multiplayer is also available in 120fps on consoles and even higher on PC, which is frankly mind-blowing, making the game feel more fluid than it ever has before.</p>
<p>It’s still pretty brown and grey, though. That’s utterly indicative of the time, of course – it wasn’t until Gears 3 that the series really found a new palette – and for all that this looks pretty damn arresting at times, I still wanted some more vibrancy beyond the blood red COG logos and shining blue armour highlights. Reloaded builds on the work done for the Ultimate Edition a decade ago, enhancing it further, most strikingly with the lighting. If you want to be sold on a decaying, dehumanised civilisation, it does a good job of that, and with the campaign running with upscaled 4K at 60fps on PS5 and with HDR, it’s never looked better. PS5 Pro can push a touch further with resolution, shadow quality and PSSR, but it looks great on the base console.</p>

<p>For all that Gears might be the poster boy for the frat-boy, mid-2000s era of gaming, your comrades are even dumber than I remember. While Dom, Baird and Cole will do some work along the way, they’ll also stand in your way, run back and forth under enemy fire, and on occasion be more of a nuisance than you’d want. Sometimes you’ll just hear them thumping around somewhere nearby, and when those thumps are as loud as they are in Gears, it’s an unnecessary distraction.</p>
<p>Tie that up with a few graphical glitches – my favourite saw a painting end up stuck on Dom’s neck for a while, like he’d inadvertently ended up in a comedy skit with some Locust playfully hitting him over the head with it – and you can still see the Xbox 360 origins if you scrape away a few layers of the shiny paint.</p>
<p>There are a few little PlayStation 5 exclusive features here, and one of them is that the speaker in your DualSense delivers all the comm messages from Anya as well as the area-cleared audio notes, which is a nice touch, albeit one that reminds you that your speaker is probably turned up too loud. You can, of course, turn it off if you want to.</p>

<p>I hope that this is the start of Microsoft bringing across the rest of the Gears games, though it does feel like we should be getting something more like the Master Chief Collection at this point, at least for the first three games. There’s still a hell of a lot to like in the first Gears game – it is a classic that launched a thousand over-the-shoulder third-person cover shooters after all – but the series gets better, with 2’s campaign and 3’s multiplayer still holding position as the true highlights. The iconic Horde mode didn’t arrive until Gears 2 as well, and a Gears game without that now feels strangely lopsided.</p>

		<p>Playing My Hero Academia: All’s Justice highlights one big thing for me: I really need to catch up and watch the anime. I think I’m at least three seasons behind now, and the eighth and final season is about to air in just over a month, but on top of all that, there’s a new series-capping game coming with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | Battle Systems Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QUi-Mrzrnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the previous games, this is a 3v3 3D arena battler, but with the jump to the final season, we have a roster stuffed full of characters who’ve now reached maturity and levelled up all their abilities. Where Shoto was a rough around the edged glass cannon at the start of the series –&nbsp;for reasons that were quickly revealed –&nbsp;he’s now mastered the powers of One For All, able to call upon more layers of inherited abilities than before.</p>


<p>One of the main draws here will naturally be playing through the story mode and reliving the various staged battles between heroes and villains depicted in the Final War arc of the manga and anime, but then there’s also just all the wish-fulfilment and fun of creating distinctly mixed up fighting trios and pitting them head to head. I stuck with the good vs. bad divide, and had a lot of fun with with the baddies, who definitely had the feel of being more powerful.</p>


<p>Combat revolves around four core actions, with a locked-on target combo, a guard and counter-attack, and an unblockable attack to break through a stern defence. Being able to dash and get out of the way of an attack is key, but so too is being able to quickly swap characters and resume the fight with a different set of powers and abilities. Bakugo’s explosive fists are better at short range, while Todoroki’s mixed fire and ice give him enhanced movement and a bit more range, so you could adjust to a rival’s tactics. Of course, if one of your fighters is knocked out, then your options become a bit more limited!</p>
<p>New for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, eventually filling a meter until you can trigger it and boost the power of your character with increased attack power, movement speed and recovery speed – it’s a pretty big bump, and it’s automatically granted to you when reduced to your last character, which is nice.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Plus Ultra abilities, which can be used to trigger a Plus Ultra Combo and bring your full squad in for a devastating combo attack of character switching.</p>

<p>While there’s no doubt going to be a lot of returning players diving into All’s Justice, work has been put in to try and make this more accessible with a new single-button auto-combo to take off some of the load while trying to keep pace with the battling. It’s definitely a bit of a help, given how difficult it is just to maintain distance and positioning sometimes, but it’s intended as just a stepping stone up to the regular control scheme.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this feels like a solid evolution of the One’s Justice games and should be a great way to wrap up the series in video game form, adding a few gameplay tweaks and with a smidgeon of added accessibility.&nbsp;Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go and figure out where I got up to in the anime…</p>
