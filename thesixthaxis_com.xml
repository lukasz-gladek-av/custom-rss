		<p>I’ve been ill. Wallowing in a horrible flu-ridden morass, and sleeping a hell of a lot. I have had some companions through this Lemsip-flavoured fog, though, and I’ve especially loved my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-review/">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. This is a football game that doesn’t feel like a football game, and it’s just a cracking JRPG that happens to feature kicking a ball. Besides that, I’ve been playing the demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and that’s just lovely, while I’ve been balancing things out with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontier of Pandora’s</a> bombastic newest expansion, From The Ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> was first up this week, and he’s played Ghost of Yotei, Borderlands 4, and also delved into Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, though he worries, “I’m trapped beneath countless open-world games!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been revisiting a couple of his favourites after wrapping up his playthrough Mafia: The Old Country (which was also a great game). He says, “For the first time in many months, I stepped back into the sandbox realm of Calradia for Mount &amp; Blade 2’s War Sails expansion. As the name implies, this DLC is all about naval gameplay, having also introduced a Viking-influenced faction. I’m learning the ropes of how to run my own ship while making lucrative trade runs between cities, hoping to save enough to buy a big ‘ol warship.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I’ve also been playing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide after picking up the post-launch character DLCs. The nimble, punk-styled Hive Scum is fun to play as though I’ve decided to main the Arbites class, channelling my inner Judge Dredd as I dole out justice beneath the Undercity.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit of Star Wars Outlaws, but most of his time has been split between Big Hops and MIO: Memories In Orbit for review.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> “thinks” he finished Hades 2 this week. That’s not due to some Roguelike dementia, but rather the difficulty level, saying, “There’s a few challenges remaining but they are well beyond my abilities. All in all, what an incredible game!” He also played ‘real-life’ games, telling us, “My son and I had an epic battle of Warhammer 40k down our local games shop. His Tyranids versus my Battle Sisters, pretty much everyone died after an epic battle, with us drawing on victory points. It was great fun and we’re booked in again for a rematch next week!”</p>

<p>And finally for this week, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun with skirting board in his free time, so hasn’t really carried on from his holiday Switch 2 gaming. And the thing that he has played? He can’t tell you about it until Monday.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you played any New Year games?</p>

		<p>Ghost Ship Games has announced details for Deep Rock Galactic’s new season, including the name, date, key art and other content details. Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 is called Relics of Hoxxes and it will begin on January 29th for PC, with the console release coming two weeks afterwards on February 12th. While a new trailer for all the content has not been released, you can check out some new cosmetics.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/n8LG8V0hnws?si=zh8bceNSbjK8nUw5</p>


<p>In Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 Relics of Hoxxes, players will be sent to the new biome of the Ossuary Depths with the new Heavy Excavation mission giving the objective to find and dig up Resinite Mass deposits to send spaceward. It will not be smooth mining though as along with the normal Glyphids players will also need to deal with the new Ossiran enemies that have their own attacks to use.</p>
<p>The ‘Relic Raider’ DLC Pack, which is what the trailer above shows, will include the Relic Raider’ Armour Framework for all four classes, one ‘Relic Raider’ headgear for each class, the ‘Relic Raider’ Armour Paintjob for all armor sets, the ‘Relic Raider’ Weapon Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Framework, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Framework, and the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Paintjob. The pack will be released at the same time as Season 6 on January 29th.</p>

		<p>Another five games make up our most wanted list today, and these ones are the last few games before we plunge into the top 10. On this list is a longstanding rival making the jump to pastures new, a couple of sequels, and the return of a long dormant franchise.</p>
<h2>15 – Halo: Campaign Evolved</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In October, the once unthinkable finally happened. Microsoft’s flagship <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo franchise was confirmed to be coming to PlayStation for the first time</a>. What had long been a key part of Microsoft’s strategy to draw players to its hardware over PlayStation, is now going multiplatform with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a full on remake of the original Halo campaign with new gameplay tweaks and content. As the name suggests it will not feature any competitive PvP multiplayer, but Halo: Campaign Evolved will have two player local co-op and four player online co-op. It will also feature three new prequel missions, new enemies, more weapons including the Halo 2’s Battle Rifle, and more vehicles.</p>

<h2>14 – Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</h2>
<p><em>PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Nine years after the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/20/dawn-of-war-iii-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III</a>, we are expecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War IV</a> to launch this year, coming from new developer King Art Games. It will be a big game in which players can play through a campaign of over 70 missions while playing as one of four factions, those being Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Official Announce Trailer | Gamescom Opening Night 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The campaign is not the only part of the next entry to the RTS franchise, with multiplayer also being a key component of Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War IV. Those multiplayer modes will include &nbsp;1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer, with players able to create their own factions using the Painter mode or established factions in the universe. Other game modes will also be included such as Last Man Standing.</p>
<h2>13 – Saros</h2>
<p><em>PS5 – 30th April 2026</em></p>
<p>When something works why change the formula too much? That seems to be Housemarque’s thinking behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal’s</a> successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>. A time loop roguelike third person shooter where progress is made by repeating runs and pushing forward each time as you learn more about the world. While the gameplay is similar the story and characters are all new.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saros follows the story of Arjun Devraj, played by Rahul Kohli, a team leader of the Soltari Enforcers who have been sent to this planet. The planet is already hostile enough but the dying sun and time loop issue is stretching patience between the team. The story here will appear to focus on the stress of the time loop on Arjun and the rest of his team.</p>
<h2>12 – Nioh 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 6th February 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> was revealed back in June which came with a timed PS5 demo. The third entry to the series refreshes things again with a new protagonist and updated combat. The main character for Nioh 3 is Tokugawa Takechiyo, the now former Shogun who was forced from the top of the Shogunate by his brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu. Tokugawa Kunimatsu hasn’t wasted time by transforming the country into a Yokai infested hellscape either.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Nioh 3 has two major changes compared to the previous games. First is the more open world structure, referred to as Open Field by Koei Tecmo, and the second is the Ninja combat stance that can be used alongside the Samurai stance. Where Samurai is all about is about facing off against enemies using high, medium, and low stances to attack and counter, Ninja is about a more hit and run approach to strike quickly and efficiently. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be a great third entry and we don’t have long to wait for its release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Catch our hands on preview of Nioh 3 here</a>.</p>
<h2>11 – Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the release of the last mainline Onimusha game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is going to bring that long absence to an end. While games have changed in 20 years, it looks like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will retain its identity as a third person action game where you face off against demons in Japan. You will be able to cut through enemies using your sword and absorb different orbs that can replenish your health, your energy attack, and give you experience. A new black orb will provide pivotal story points.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword Preview – Slicing through this samurai revival" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto during the Edo period where peace is shattered as the demonic Genma launch an attack. The only one who can fight this infestation is Miyamoto Musashi due to being bonded to an Oni Gauntlet. If you are worried about having to catch up with Onimusha lore, don’t be. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is essentially a fresh start for the series, which ties into the story it’s shaping up to tell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Catch our hands on preview of Onimusha: Way of the Sword here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/09/nintendo-serves-up-a-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-deep-dive-and-baby-waluigi/</link>
            <guid>1401352</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With just a month before the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> release on 12th February for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared a gameplay deep dive to reveal a bunch of the details to the latest Mario sports game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – A courtside deep dive! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-jpcJnnllI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mario Tennis Fever is built, of course, around the core rules of Tennis with basic shots like Top Spin, Slice and Lobs, with slides and leaping shots to reach the ball… but this is a series that always brings something pretty extra. This time around it’s Fever Rackets, which can unleash all sorts of special shots and wild effects.</p>
<p>Having charged up your Fever gauge with a long enough rally, you can pull off a Fever Shot, with each of the game’s 30 rackets having a unique effect. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Racket – Freeze a patch of the court</li>
<li>Pokey Racket – Summon a Pokey</li>
<li>Shadow Racket – Summon a shadow double to play alongside you</li>
<li>Golden Dash Racket – Get a burst of speed to reach the ball</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky thing is that you can block a Fever Shot, so long as you reach and return the ball before it lands on your side of the court – Sneaky! The various Fever Shots that deal damage can also reduce your HP until you’re forced to take a time out. Oh, and in doubles, you can both unleash a Fever Shot at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s 38 characters in total, including all of the usuals and with a special shoutout for Baby Waluigi, Goomba and Nabbit. The full list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Pauline</li>
<li>Wario</li>
<li>Waluigi</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Luma</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Bowser Jr.</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Boo</li>
<li>Shy Guy</li>
<li>Koop Trooper</li>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Diddy Kong</li>
<li>Bow-Wow</li>
<li>Birdo</li>
<li>Koopa Paratroopa</li>
<li>Petey Piranha</li>
<li>Piranha</li>
<li>Boom Boom</li>
<li>Blooper</li>
<li>Dry Bowser</li>
<li>Bry Bones</li>
<li>Baby Mario</li>
<li>Baby Luigi</li>
<li>Baby Peach</li>
<li>Wriggler</li>
<li>Nabbit</li>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Baby Wario</li>
<li>Baby Waluigi</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has particular stats, but you can match them up with any racket.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of modes to play in, from a standard tournament (now with commentary), to the tricky&nbsp;Trial Towers and Mix It Up mode, where you’ll have to play minigame modes like Ring Shot, Forest Court Match, Pinball Match, Racket Factory Match, Wonder Court Match (with Super Mario Wonder effects).</p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a ton of multiplayer. Up to four players can play on a single system in split-screen, while there’s local wireless multiplayer, and support for GameShare (which also supports streaming to the original Nintendo Switch, even though this is a Switch 2 exclusive). Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever also has amiibo support, with various Mario amiibo changing the design of the ball used within play, but not actual gameplay effects.</p>
