		<p>34BigThings has announced that Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is going to be released on February 6th, with the game coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. The release date has been revealed as part of a new gameplay trailer for Carmageddon: Rogue Shift which shows some of the different vehicles and weapons that can be used in the carnage of the races.</p>

<p>Last month, 34BigThings gave details five <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/carmageddon-rogue-shift-first-five-vehicles-have-been-detailed/">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift’s vehicles,</a> which are shown in the above trailer. The Eagle GT is considered a good allrounder muscle car, while the Clunker is a tankier option. &nbsp;The Firecracker Turbo will be for players who value speed over everything else, and the SQR-NE55 is one that balances all the vehicle stats. Finally, the Hawk GT has high offensive capabilities and acceleration, but sacrifices handling as a result.</p>
<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rockstar chalked up the first win in their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">dispute with fired employees</a>, as a UK tribunal rejected the former developers their request for interim pay while pursuing allegations of union busting by the studio.</p>
<p>Denying this request, Judge Frances Eccles said that the staff would have had to demonstrate a “pretty good chance of success” in proving they were fired for unionisation efforts, and that they had not managed to do so at this early juncture. Of course, the case will still go ahead and it’s possible for further arguments and evidence to come to light.</p>


<p>A Rockstar spokesperson issued a statement saying:</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</span></p>

<p>The IWGB shared a statement with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<p>“We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar’s flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful.</p>
<p>“[…] the judge stated in her ruling that: ‘There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'”. The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal “until six weeks later”, and zero evidence of an investigation.”</p>
<p>However, further background from the ruling includes that the judge noted the volume of non-employees featured within the IWGB Discord ground, including someone who had written press articles about video games, that some fired employees were based in Canada and thus could not have been union members, and that there were those expressing support for unionisation that were not dismissed.</p>
<p>People Makes Games were in court and shared details of the evidence that was demonstrated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rockstar vs. Union: We Went to Court and Saw the Evidence" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Per Chris Bratt’s account of viewing the hard copies of submitted evidence, it seems that one employee was fired for expressing that they were not working ‘crunch’ hours yet, about generative AI being approved for use by legal, and further stuff that was branded as so top secret by Rockstar’s barrister that they didn’t want it read out loud in court. Except it could easily be read and is valid to be reported on by PMG. This included complaints over difficulty to book time off, including mention of a team’s staffing size, mentioning 32-player online sessions (which would be an increase in lobby size from 30 players in the current GTA Online).</p>
<p>These details were claimed to be “highly confidential and commercially sensitive” in Rockstar’s arguments, whose stance is that any kind of leaked detail, even seemingly innocuous like if you were in crunch or not, can have a dramatic impact, such as with the billions of dollars wiped off Take Two’s valuation after announcing GTA 6’s delay to November 2026. For that reason, Rockstar fired employees immediately.</p>
<p>So, Rockstar has won this day in court, but there’s a long way to go and a variety of different outcomes. The judge will have to decide, once further arguments and evidence has been presented, whether these dismissals were fair and meet the threshold of “gross misconduct”, and from that point, whether this was Rockstar engaging in union busting.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that we end up in a middle ground where Rockstar is able to dodge the union busting charge, but still get dinged for unfair dismissal. In the meantime, unionisation efforts at Rockstar can continue with all those employees that Rockstar couldn’t find cause to dismiss, and certainly will be much wiser about keeping their conversations within a clearly closed group.</p>

		<p>Publisher Microids and developer Fishing Cactus have confirmed that Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean remake will be releasing on May 18th for PC. The previously announced console versions are nowhere in sight however. Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean was originally released in 1999, tasking players with controlling the Caribbean sea using might and trade as a privateer. A new gameplay trailer has been released so you can see the game in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corsairs – Battle of the Caribbean – Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bg7sZr-phRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean will have a campaign mode in which you can play as five factions, each with their own ambitions. There is also online multiplayer for up to four players, and a brand new Skirmish mode so players can jump right into the action. The multiplayer has an Elo-based ranking system so players are matched with people similar to their own skill and rank. Players can build fleets made up of 12 different ship, including unique faction ships, and use three different types of ammo in naval battles. There is also boarding between ships with player’s soldiers consisting of three classes, with those being Gunner, Agile, and Tank.</p>
<p>In Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean players will also need to manage trade across the territory, and keep sailing to find new resources and islands to claim. Cities will provide additional bonuses for players as trade grows, and new upgrades for the fleet can be discovered through sailing around the map and completing quests. A price for the game is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Season 2 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> has been delayed until February, Battlefield Studios has announced, with an extension to Season 1 coming to fill the extra month wait.</p>
<p>Season 2 will now start on 17th February, with Season 1’s battle pass extended up until that point, and with new weekly challenges and a Frostfire Bonus Path of content being added on 27th January.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKfsTB3uKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The team writes, “During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2.”</p>
<p>So what’s coming to fill out Season 1? Well, an update is set to land on 20th January with fixes and stability improvements, and this will be followed on 27th January by the Frostfire Bonus Path of battle pass. This includes a weapon package, soldier skin XP Boosts and more for those with the premium Battle Pass, while a free track will include Hardware XP Boost, vehicle skin, player card customisation, and the like.</p>

<p>The Bonus Path will work alongside and not instead of the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you still have more time to round off any more unlock tiers you need or want. However, all Bonus Path Points are earned through Weekly Challenges, and not all Weekly Challenges reward those points. Expect people to get annoyed by this.</p>
<p>A little further away, a Valentine’s Day event is coming with duos, there’s more daily login rewards and double XP weekends to flesh everything out.</p>
<p>This has all been rather disappointing for the community on Reddit, with a fairly doom-laden outlook on how much content has been added to the game so far. There’s been comparisons to the map output of Battlefield 4’s paid DLC, memes about map design, critiques of cosmetics and general concern for the future of the game. EA struck a huge and symbolic victory over Call of Duty with Battlefield 6, but they need to keep up the game’s support in order to cement their status as a true rival and counterpart.</p>

			<p>There’s a game for the original DS called Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. In it, you play as a slime and have to load up your cool tower with all sorts of powerful ammunition to beat other towers. It’s one of those games that stands out in my memory as not only being a lot of fun, but also a concept I don’t feel like has been revisited since. DuneCrawl has a couple of mechanics that feel in the same spirit, and while the whole package is a bit uneven, that did put a smile on my face.</p>
<p><iframe title="DuneCrawl - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Im0Hx3iLVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DuneCrawl is an open-world adventure game where you get to sit on top of a big old crab and fight other big crabs using cannons, yourself, and anything else you find. That’s only part of it though; it’s really more of a game where you explore dungeon-like areas to rescue people, find treasures, and progress the story. I wish the game was more weighted towards the cool crab fights, but alas, here we are.</p>



<p>Combat on the crab is loading up the cannons, firing, and using a shield to bounce things back. You can load yourself or another player in the cannon for cool boarding shenanigans though, and that’s wonderfully silly in a Sea of Thieves kind of way.</p>

<p>Non-crab combat is fairly standard hack and slash stuff. You get a bunch of weapons you can cycle through for different effects, which weirdly includes health potions, and have to try and hit stuff before stuff hits you. It’s fine, really, and some of the weapons are pretty cool, but it’s not a standout example of this genre.</p>
<p>The world is nice though. I enjoyed exploring things both on and off-crab, and there’s a solid sense of humour running through a lot of the quests that’ll help keep you entertained. The idea of this world that has issues with pottery and worships crabs is just kind of fun, and it helps make it feel genuinely unique very early on. I just wish the gameplay felt a little bit more special as well. It all just feels okay for the most part, and I want more than that from my games.</p>

<p>DuneCrawl is at its best with friends, which is really the saving grace here. As is so often the case, running around all of this stuff with a friend or two really elevates everything and ends up being a genuinely entertaining time. After all, where else can you load a friend into a cannon and then fire them off into the distance just for fun? That’s the kind of experience that we’re all after, and sure, it can be used to actually play the game as intended, but it’s nice to mess around with too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		DuneCrawl is an interesting game that blends together giant crab combat, dungeoneering and multiplayer shenanigans. It's fun enough, but I really wish it did a little bit more with the more unusual aspects of its game design.&nbsp;	</p></div>
