		<p>While the F1 season is just getting started – or perhaps finishing if you’re Liam Lawson – Codemasters have timed things perfectly with the announcement of F1 25, the next instalment in the long-running series, coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on the 30th of May, 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2025 is set to be one of the biggest years for F1. Alongside the on-track action that of course lies at the heart of it, we’ve also just had the latest season of Netflix’s smash hit Drive to Survive, and later this year we’re getting the F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt as a washed up racer given one more shot at F1 glory.</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton, in his first season with Ferrari, will be the cover star for the game’s special Iconic edition, which makes sense as to why he’s the star of this reveal trailer, with it showing him getting his elbows out and winning a hard fought race in the game.</p>
<p>The fan-favourite story mode, Braking Point, will return in F1 2025, with Konnersport now battling for championships, as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point now comes with multiple difficulty settings which will cater to both returning players and rookies alike, ensuring that everyone can get in on the story-based action.</p>

<p>My Team will be getting a major overhaul, with players calling the shots as the owner of their F1 team, taking on ‘new responsibilities’ before getting behind the wheel as either of the team’s drivers. The EGO engine has also been tuned even further, with increased circuit authenticity made possible through LIDAR technology, and several tracks and their surroundings have been transformed with a more realistic look and feel, building on last year’s already-impressive visuals. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed shortly through a new entry in the F1 25 Deep Dive series.</p>
<p>“F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory,” said Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters. “This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">greatly enjoyed F1 24</a>, saying “EA F1 24 is the best rendition of the sport yet, and a fantastic simulation of the iconic motorsport. If you want to forge your own Drive To Survive-style superstardom, this is the perfect place to start. If it’s good enough for Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, then it’s good enough for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>EA Sports F1 25 will release on the 30th of May for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Who knows, maybe there’ll be a speedy Switch 2 launch as well!</p>
