		<p>Relic Entertainment has revealed their upcoming turn-based strategy game Earth vs Mars, an original IP that looks like a blend of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and classic Martian war romps from Hollywood like Mars Attacks! The game is expected to release for PC in summer 2025, and could be ported to consoles after that.</p>

<p>As mankind sets foot on Mars for the first time, the locals take that very, very personally, hijacking the airwaves to declare war on Earth. You’ll have to lead Earth’s military to fight back an overwhelming Martian invasion, battling against flying saucers, grav-tanks and the alien’s elite warriors with a blend of conventional military units and experimental hybrid supersoldiers courtesy of the Splice-O-Tron.</p>
<p>And we really mean experimental, as you mix pretty much any of Earth’s native species together: “Rain acid from the skies with the fast-moving cheetah-fly. Charge through enemy lines with devastating human-rhino hybrids. Or strike from the forests with your deadly squirrel-cow infantry.”</p>
<p>The game will feature a 30 mission single-player narrative campaign with hand-crafted levels, as well as online multiplayer, and AI vs mode, and map editor.</p>

<p>This is the first game in the new Relic Labs initiative from Relic Entertainment, who are looking to find their feet after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">going independent from Sega in early 2024</a> – this followed the underperformance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3/">Company of Heroes 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">significant layoffs across Sega</a>. Relic Labs games look to break away from the studio’s traditional stomping ground of real time strategy to explore new sub-genres and release more games more frequently.</p>
<p>The company will still, of course, continue to develop RTS games as their main output, and they have such a rich history that includes everything from Homeworld, Dawn of War, Company of Heroes and work for hire jobs, like Age of Empires IV.</p>

		<p>It’s Pokémon Day on 27th February, and to mark the annual celebration, The Pokémon Company will have a Pokémon Present video.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Presents video will go live at 2PM UK time – <span dir="auto">6:00AM PST / 10:00 PM SGT – on that date.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="February 27 is Pokémon Day!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8gkKHR512M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s as far as The Pokémon Company has gone in revealing what will be shown, but we can absolutely make some educated guesses.</p>
<p>Top billing will surely go to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-for-2025/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the next big console game in the series that was announced at Pokémon Day last year with a 2025 target. An offshoot to the main series, just like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> was, this game takes us to the high tech new city of Lumiose City, where the world is being reshaped as part of an “urban redevelopment plan” to accommodate people and Pokémon together. We’re keen to see some meaningful gameplay from this one, and perhaps get a release date?</p>

<p>Beyond that we can expect plenty of updates on mobile and live service games. That will surely include the perennial Pokémon Go, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/12/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-launches-december-17th/">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, Pokémon Masters EX, Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Cafe ReMix and the slumbersome Pokémon Sleep.</p>
<p>But will there be any surprises? We’re in a bit of a lull for the franchise as a whole, as Arceus and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> both launched in 2022, the latter having DLC expansions through 2023. We know that Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming this year, but they might see fit to tease the next mainline game for 2026, perhaps?</p>
<p>If they did do that, we could be sure that these games will be cross-gen at the least. There’s pretty much no chance of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2</a> exclusive game coming within the first couple years of that console’s life – Sword and Shield was over two years after the Switch launched, to have a large enough audience, so expect the next mainline Pokémon game to want to tap into the huge playerbase that might not yet have upgraded. Additionally, there surely won’t be any Switch 2 chatter before the console’s big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Nintendo Direct presentation on 2nd April</a>.</p>

		<p>Indie psychological horror hit Mouthwashing is coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch in 2025, developer Wrong Organ and publisher CR Channel have announced. The game will have both a digital and physical release.</p>
<p>Mouthwashing released in September last year for PC, the game immediately getting plenty of attention for its dark narrative, in which five crew members of The Pony Express deal with dwindling resources and extreme isolation, descending into madness that’s accentuated by the retro PSX visual style.</p>


<p>The game has just passed the 500,000 sales mark on PC, with the team writing that this “honestly feels more surreal than any bizzaro psychosis.” They continue, “Everyone, you truly are incredible and we’re extremely grateful to you for taking a part in this painful journey and on behalf of everyone here both at Wrong Organ and CR Channel we want to say thank you!”</p>
<p>The next port of call is the aforementioned console releases. They’ve teamed up with Fangamer for a run of the game in physical form, alongside a digital release on both platforms. You can <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/pages/mouthwashing-physical-edition">sign up to be notified</a> of the physical edition’s availability –&nbsp;it’s sure to be in high demand, like so many indie game physical prints.</p>

<p>The Fangamer partnership will go beyond just the physical game, with a bunch of Mouthwashing merch that will include apparel, plushies, vinyl and more.</p>
