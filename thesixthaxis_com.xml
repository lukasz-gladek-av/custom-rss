		<p>What kind of game is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>? Following its reveal last year, featuring 1950s retro-futuristic tech and a story set in the wake of a nuclear disaster, it might have seemed to be a British riff on the modern Fallout series, but as has been stated time and again in headlines across the gaming press, Atomfall is not Fallout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eIqZnxhVvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In terms of the narrative at least, this is more of a British STALKER than Fallout. The game takes place following the Windscale disaster in North-East England –&nbsp;the worst nuclear accident in UK history in which one of the reactors caught fire for three days and released radioactive material into the atmosphere. While nowhere near the scale of disaster of Chernobyl, it was also subject to a cover up, the UK government massively downplaying the severity of the issue and failing to evacuate the surrounding area.</p>


<p>In Atomfall, something very different is at play, a mystical force or being known as Oberon, the military group known as Protocol moving in, and a lockdown that has cut the region off from the rest of the world for the last five years. That’s led to a stark divide as some live within the secured confines of Wyndham Village, while feathered outlaws and mask-wearing druids roam the surrounding wilderness, only really interrupted by the occasional Protocol patrol.</p>


<p>Our hands-on time picks up a few hours into the story, as you set foot in Casterfell Woods for the first time. This region is largely controlled by the druids, who follow what they call The Voice in the Soil, having set up wooden walls around their camps, keeping massive bonfires alight, and with towering wicker men standing watch. The druids aren’t openly hostile to you upon first sight – they shout warnings to say they don’t know if you’re a danger to them, in fact – but they’re quick to defend themselves with a strong attack if you get too close or are openly armed. Since they tend to patrol in groups, you’d do will to keep a little distance.</p>
<p>After all, you’re armed with deeply insufficient weaponry. The events at Windscale have led to accelerated corrosion in the region, particularly affecting metals, and with everyone cut off, you’ll be walking around with rusty shooters. At least you can always rely on a handy hatchet to throw at enemies and a good old cricket bat for a bit of melee clobbering –&nbsp;it’s all starting to sound a bit Clockwork Orange here, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Staying away from the druids and bandits won’t always be an option. Tramping through the woods following the one lead I had at this stage, I make my way to meet Mother Jago, a villager that’s outcast herself from the village and made a funny little life for herself at the old mine, making natural tonics and remedies. She’s happy to help, giving you the lay of the land, but for a little more of the mystery, she just asks that you do a little favour and go get her herbalism book back from the druids.</p>
<p>Of course, you can go in all guns blazing, but you’ll probably have a hard time of it, when there’s limited ammo. So it’s much better to take a stealthier approach, hiding away in thick grass to keep out of view once you reach their base at a ruined castle. Heading into the cave network beneath reveals this otherworldly blue glowing growths all over the place, and even more horrors as there’s sometimes human bodies incorporated into this. I later encounter the Ferals that these poor souls might turn into, zombie-like creatures that glow blue from the insides and spit blue goop once you get too close. Get hit by their attacks, and heavy whispers flood your ears – is this the Voice?</p>

<p>Clearly the events at the atom factory have unleashed something, and through exploring the region and continuing down the questlines I had discovered, it certainly feels like there’s multiple paths to take through this story. Do you choose to align with the very real Voice, or is that related to the ‘Oberon’ that you’re told you must kill when answering one of the oddly placed red telephone boxes?</p>
<p>Pulling on the narrative threads help me discover the survivor of a helicopter crash, holed up in a communications bunker and with a nudge to help you access the Interchange and discover more of what B.A.R.D. were up to down there – just beware of mutated rat swarms that will absolutely rinse your healing supplies. You’ll also inevitably be drawn to Wyndham Village, uncovering the tales of the locals who remain under the thumb of the Protocol rule.</p>
<p>Throughout, I’m reminded a little more of something like BioShock than I am Fallout. With the limited supplies and the damage that enemies can deal to you, there’s a particular feel to the combat that I find reminiscent, even if you’re not shooting bees out of your fingertips. Instead you’ll be scavenging for usable items and crafting materials to use with various recipes you find. There’s also a ‘learning potion’ cooked up by B.A.R.D. that gives points toward learning new skills –&nbsp;it’s a reward for exploring and a good alternative to gathering XP and levelling up.</p>

<p>I also love the visual style and tone of Atomfall. There’s common ground to Rebellion’s other games in the look and feel of the world, but instead of bombed out cities and facilities of World War 2, it’s distinctively British, from the stone buildings in the village to the army fatigues and flatcaps, and even to the way the druids have decorated their caves with multicoloured bunting. Decorations fit for a jubilee!</p>
<p>I came out of my time with Atomfall with an awful lot of questions for the whole mystery surrounding Windscale and entrapping the local population, but also a ton of answers for what this game actually is. I’ve honestly no idea which way I’ll lean while wending my way through the full narrative, but I enjoy the feel of this world that Rebellion has crafted, the late 50s / early 60s style of the world and its inhabitants, and the leanings of the gameplay and combat.</p>
<p>There’s just a few weeks before the full game is released, with Atomfall launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 27th March.</p>

		<p>A week has whizzed by, and while there’s been all sorts of news, I’ve mostly been playing Monster Hunter Wilds, along with making my way through Split Fiction with Tef. I’ve got a bunch of things to take a look at this weekend… but I’ll probably end up playing Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>To begin with the team’s rundown, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. This is, of course, unexpected. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamco</strong> has been playing Balatro, Avowed, Phasmophobia and Orcs Must Die 3. He said, “Balatro is particularly addictive!”. And then we heard no more from him.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> is also heavily invested in Monster Hunter, and he told us, “I’ve got an endgame version of every weapon type and am fancy looking.” This is the way.</p>
<p>Weirdly, <strong>Jim</strong> has been fighting the urge to play more Monster Hunter Wilds and taking aim at his backlog instead. He says, “I blitzed through A Plague Tale: Innocence which was a fun rat-filled romp that was well-paced and never outstayed its welcome. Next up, I’m finally looking to beat Mafia III ahead of the next game in the series launching later this year.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> is allowed to tell you he has been playing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows a whole lot! But that is all you’re allowed to know. He’s also currently anticipating a delivery person arriving to give him a copy of Split Fiction to play with his partner.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/glover-qubyte-classics-review/">Glover</a> for review, saying, “It wasn’t great”, but things thankfully looked up, telling us that, “Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii which is a silly and fun spin off, and This Way Madness Lies, a RPG where magical girls save worlds based on the plays of Shakespeare. It was fun and had some good comedy in it. Plus it only takes around 6 hours to complete so well worth a playthrough.”</p>
<p>Though he’s not had much time for gaming this week, <strong>Steve</strong> managed to finish off Eternal Strands and carried on with some Princess Peach Showtime on commutes to uni. He told us what he’s planning to do next, saying, “I need to get back into Avowed where I reached the second area with a two-handed club that seems to one-shot most non-named enemies… I’ve also got some indie games to look at once the current avalanche of marking subsides.”</p>

<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Tef</strong> has (as I’ve already said) been playing Split Fiction with me. We’re onto the final stretch now, so you can expect a review pretty soon. Even sooner than that, though, keep an eye out for his previews of Atomfall and Blades of Fire later today!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>
