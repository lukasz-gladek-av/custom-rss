		<p>In a roadmap update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, 11 bit studios has revealed that the console port of their post-apocalyptic city builder is planned for release this summer.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 roadmap now has three major landmarks on it with fairly well defined time windows. 8th May will see the first free major content update that will make adjustments to the City’s management, before the console port arrives at some point in the summer. There’s then an autumn target for the Spectrum DLC.</p>


<p>Further away is two more DLC packs. The Aurora DLC is still expected this year, while the untitled DLC 3 is coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from 11 bit:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>May 8th</b> – A day to be remembered: a <b>Free Major Content Update</b> that will adjust the City’s management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners.</li>
<li><b>Summer</b> – A grand undertaking: the <b>Console Port</b>.</li>
<li><b>Autumn</b> – Reaching the <b>Spectrum DLC</b>, which may help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…</li>
</ul>
<p>They also hint that fans of these gritty city builders should keep an eye out for a seventh anniversary celebration of the original game on 24th April.</p>
