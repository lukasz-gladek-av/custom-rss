		<p>Ubisoft has started email users of its services that it is rolling out age verification for Ubisoft accounts, with limits coming in for social features so players can only interact with people on their friends list unless the account is verified. It does not look like it is worldwide but does affect countries where laws require age verification for people to access some content, including the UK with the introduction of the Online Safety Act. This move seems to be specifically about the UK</p>
<p>In the email I received, Ubisoft wrote, <em>“To keep our community safe and ensure age‑appropriate experiences for all players, Ubisoft is introducing a new age verification step for certain communication features. This update also helps us comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</em></p>


<div>
<h4><em>What is changing</em></h4>
<p><em>If your Ubisoft chat setting was previously set to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, it has now been switched to “<b>Friends Only</b>”. You can still chat freely with people on your friends list, but you’ll need to verify that you are&nbsp;<b>18 or older</b>&nbsp;to use text or voice chat with players outside your friends list.</em></p>
<p><em>This update applies to your experience on&nbsp;<b>PC and mobile</b>. On&nbsp;<b>console</b>, nothing changes: your platform settings continue to apply.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><em>Why this is required</em></h2>
<p><em>This step helps us maintain a safe environment for all players and offer more tailored experiences while meeting UK regulatory requirements. Your privacy stays fully protected. Age verification is handled securely and Ubisoft does not store your identity documents. They are used only to confirm your age.</em></p>

</div>
<div>
<h4><em>How to verify your age</em></h4>
<p><em>You can complete the verification at any time from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0caF7g4wSNpeNsZYgNEbwO">Privacy center</a> on the Ubisoft Account website. Simply switch your Voice &amp; Text Chat setting to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, then follow the verification steps. You’ll only need to do this&nbsp;<b>once</b>. More details about age verification and how it works are available on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DHYae_AQUQ6g5hGqaKyg0">Ubisoft Help</a>. Thank you for helping us keep our community safe and enjoyable for everyone.”</em></p>
<p>If you choose to verify your age to access text and voice chat with people that are not on your friend list Ubisoft is providing four ways to do this. The first is to use the Yoti Digital ID app through which you confirm your ID and get a digital ID that can be used for different services. The second is age estimation where you take a photo and software estimates your age. Ubisoft states that these photos are not store and are encrypted. The third way is to upload a photo of your ID and scan your face to confirm it matches. Again, Ubisoft says that none of this data is stored or shared. The final way is to do a credit card check to confirm you are over 18. Ubisoft has confirmed that this only applies to voice and text chat through the Ubisoft platforms on PC and mobile, but not on consoles as those are controlled by their parent companies.</p>
