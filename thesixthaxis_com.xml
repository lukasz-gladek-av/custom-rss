		<p>Many years ago, in the last century in fact, there were rumours that Hideo Kojima was in talks to create a video game based on the blockbuster film The Matrix.&nbsp; That never came to pass and Shiny Entertainment took the license and released two games which were cannon within the Matrix universe. They were Enter the Matrix and The Path of Neo, and both were rather good, I remember spending most of one Christmas playing Enter The Matrix.</p>
<p>A new interview with Christopher Bergstresser, a former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, has revealed that “the Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima” and met with him along with Aki Saito and Kasumi Kitaue, an executive at Konami.</p>


<p>“The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that’?” recalls Christopher. “Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’.”</p>
<p>It seems that Kojima continued to be interested in the idea, but it never came to pass, probably as Konami had him busy with Metal Gear Solid 2 at the time.</p>
<p>Kojima continued to correspond with the Wachowskis and in 2000 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">met with them</a> to discuss the similarities between their works.&nbsp; “I have seen (The Matrix) four times. I like this type of work. What I was planning to do in my next project, they pretty much made into a motion picture. We were planning on certain things like characters running on walls and such, but they’ve beat me to it (laughs).”</p>

<p>Later, Kojima’s hit Death Stranding explored similar themes as The Matrix franchise, such as the blurring of reality and another world, while the character Higgs has similarities to Agent Smith.</p>
<p>However, this might not be the end of the story. Kojima is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">working on OD for Microsoft</a>, and we now know that is going to be an anthology horror game with a famous directors taking on an episode. The only confirmed name is Jordan Peele, but the Wachowskis would be an excellent choice for an episode.</p>
