		<p>Summer Gamesfest has drawn to a close with the reveal of Resident Evil 9: Requiem, which was teased earlier in the show.</p>
<p>The game stars Grace, an FBI investigator who is sent to look at a murder at the Renwood Hotel, the same location where her mother was murdered.&nbsp; The game is said to be a “bold shift” in both tone and gameplay.<br>
Although rumours suggested Resi 9 would be multiplayer the official website confirms this is a single player game. </p>


<p>The game will launch on February 27th 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</p>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> launch today, 1047 had one more surprise for their portal-infused shooter: a whole battle royale mode! Even if that isn’t your thing, the rest of this Halo-inspired portally arena shooter could well be up your alley, and it’s out today across PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement of the battle royale mode came with some big ttalk on the stage of Summer Game Fest, as 1047 boss NAME decried playing “the same” Call of Duty every year, and wished that we could just finally get a Titanfall 3, please.</p>
<p>But that’s beside the point, really. Splitgate 2 is out now. From what I’ve played of the beta, it’s pretty fun.</p>

		<p>I don’t think anyone expected a Wu-Tang game to show up at Summer Games Fest tonight, but here w are. New developer Brass Lion Entertainment has revealed Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a 3 player co-op action RPG that will have anime style fighting. At the moment, the game has only been confirmed for PC coming to Steam and Epic Games Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver | Official Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>According to the game’s description, Ghostface Killah has called on you to help save the rest of his Wu brothers, who are fighting The Deceiver. The forces of The Deceiver have invaded Shaolin and you have to fight these enemies in Chambers. Within these Chambers, players will have the chance to use various skills that the members of Wu-Tang Clan have to use against the enemy forces. There will also be customisation options through collecting Jewels, which will be used to adapt your fight style and your fashion fit.</p>
