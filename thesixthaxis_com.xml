            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Setting up a new Wi-Fi router used to fill me with dread. The idea of pulling all the cables out, rummaging behind the sofa, finding the extremely poorly placed power socket, and then going through the rigmarole of changing every single item in our house over to a new network with increasingly difficult to enter passwords used to rank amongst the worst tasks in modern life.</p>
<p>Thankfully, networking companies have realised they can make things easier for you, while also putting out some of the fastest, most cutting-edge Wi-Fi tech around. It’s clear that Netgear have put serious thought into their brand-new Nighthawk range of Wi-Fi 7 routers, and, after a simple onboarding process, your home’s internet will be ripping along faster than ever before.</p>



<p>In the box, you’re getting the top-of-the-range Nighthawk RS700 router, a power brick with both UK and US attachments, and a standard 2m ethernet cable for connecting to your incoming cable or fibre internet doodah. As you’re pulling everything out of the box, the immediate thing you’re going to notice is how big and imposing the Nighthawk router actually is. It’s a chonky, wedge-shaped beast, with silver metal venting at the top and gloss finish on the LED displays that gives it a real Cyberpunk feel.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that big a step away from the back plastics and glowing LEDs of the BT, Virgin, EE and other routers that are sat in most of the homes in the UK, but if you’re moving from something like the dinky and understated white boxes of an Eero setup, you’re certain to notice a change in aesthetics.</p>

<p>The Nighthawk RS700S is heavy. If it’s going to sit in a hallway, in danger of being knocked by flailing coats and grasping children’s hands, you might want to make sure it can’t fall off the side of a table and put a dent into your flooring. That weight does mean it’s fairly settled in place, but its tower-like design means that it’s not completely safe from toppling over.</p>

<p>You begin setup via the Nighthawk app, with some nice, streamlined QR codes pointing you towards the app on either iOS or Android. From there, the cabling experience is similarly straightforward, with a 10Gbps socket for your incoming connection or fibre internet signal, and then five ports for your home network – four at Gigabit speeds, and one at 10Gbps.</p>
<p>There’s also a USB-A 3.0 port for connecting a storage device, which you can then use via Readyshare, which is a really handy inclusion in multi-platform households or workplaces. You can access this drive remotely as a pretty literal interpretation of Network Attached Storage, and if you’re looking for a router that can truly sit at the centre of your home network setup, the Nighthawk makes it as easy as possible. That said, I’d have liked to have seen a USB-C port here as well in 2025.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk app talks you through connecting everything, and it also gives you the option of immediately swapping out the network ID and password, so you can easily just fill in the details of your old network and avoid some of the annoyance of reprogramming everything. I say ‘some’ of the annoyance, as a few of our devices still required me to reconfirm the details, while our LG TV made me completely reconnect. Whether that’s down to the shift from WiFi 6 to WiFi 7, a change in bands the device is connecting to, or a switch to a newer password security protocol, I’m not sure, but it was only a minor bump in the road, and still much faster than a wholesale change.</p>

<p>It’s little surprise to find that the Nighthawk made a clear and perceptible change to the WiFi connection and internet speed in the house. While our previous Eero setup was, on average, providing 715Mbps of download speed, the Nighthawk RS700s provided closer to 1Gbps on our individual devices through most of our testing time. It boasts a combined potential speed of 19Gbps across all its bands, though that’s admittedly a purely theoretical figure, combining 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz bands, very wide spectrum usage (which might be impractical in a busy environment), and accommodating many devices in use at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s also got three times the capacity, allowing connections to up to 200 devices. Even our, incredibly tech-heavy house doesn’t come close to touching that, but in a workplace or office setting, that’s a real selling point, and we ran multiple multiplayer gaming, streaming and chatting sessions, with everything feeling ridiculously snappy and fast.</p>
<p>I’ve also been testing GeForce Now across a number of devices, and the Nighthawk RS700S allowed for a seamless streaming experience over WiFi, while our previous WiFi 6 Eero setup had, at times, struggled to do it justice. Chomping my way through the incredible Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, its timing-heavy combat was still on point, and, unbelievably, I never felt at a disadvantage while playing via streaming. I’ve spent a great deal of time playing over streaming services like Stadia and Microsoft’s Cloud Streaming, and the Nighthawk RS700S brought more stability than ever before. Admittedly, that is as you’d hope, with the WiFi 7 protocol able to halve the latency of WiFi 6. Still, it absolutely played out during our real-world testing.</p>
<p>Range then, is perhaps the final question mark, and the Nighthawk RS700S is capable of 3500 square feet (325 square metres) of coverage. That doesn’t account for walls and ceilings getting in the way and attenuating signal, but through our three-storey townhouse, with the router on the ground floor, I still received a 100% signal on the top floor, albeit with a reduced 512Mbps speed. That’s still excellent, and for most home settings, I think a single Nighthawk router will suffice. If you need even wider coverage, you might want to look at a mesh system rather than a sole router, or a WiFi extender, but these have their own limitations, and can cause you interference rather than improving your internet experience.</p>
<p>At £550 RRP, the Nighthawk RS700S is an extremely expensive addition to your home network setup, but it’s one that has clear and immediate benefits, especially if you’re bringing the latest WiFi 7-equipped tech into your house like the iPhone 17, Honor Magic V5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro. It’s likely only going to truly appeal to those on the cutting edge, but with its ease of setup, comprehensive app support and tangible results, the Nighthawk RS700S is a winning combination, especially in gaming-centric homes.</p>

		<p>The inevitable happens at the start of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, and Samus Aran is depowered by the time she wakes up on Viewros. Time to search out a whole host of new abilities, weapon power-ups, energy tanks and ammo expansions then!</p>
<p>The first biome in the game, Fury Green, is mainly a tutorial area your first time through, keeping things simple as you gain your first handful of new abilities. You will regularly return to Fury Green through the story, though, and that means there’s time to revisit corners of the map to access blocked areas and secrets.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of all the items in the order in which you can find them.</p>


<p>But first, if you want to keep spoilers to a minimum for how you need to explore the world, know that the game does feature item maps that you can unlock once you’re into the final stretch of the game. We’ll soon have a guide on where to find all of the Scout Bots for each location.</p>
<p>Now, onto the Fury Green walkthrough.</p>

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirements – Psychic Glove</em></p>
<p>You really can’t miss this, it’s a core part of the first run through the Fury Green region, with a strange orb that asks you to drag an item across its face using the Psychic Glove. Do this and you’re rewarded with an Energy Tank.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Missile Launcher</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve earned the missile launcher, you can start smashing the hard orange resin all around this area. In the Grove of the Sacred Tree, just after rescuing MacKenzie and the save station, make sure to blow up the resin wall on the left which hides a Missile Expansion</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb</em></p>
<p>After defeating the boss within Fury Green, you will have to take a new path to get back to MacKenzie which eventually gets you back to familiar ground. In the ball tunnel between the Psychic Seed and where MacKenzie is waiting, look out for a brightly coloured seed on the side. Place a Psychic Bomb next to this and you’ll have your first Missile Expansion from the game!</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb (and Psychic Boots)</em></p>
<p>This needs some back tracking and is only possible from the second time that you visit Fury Green – it’s best to just get this once you’ve got some further upgrades not to waste time. You can start at the original entrance to Fury Green without Psychic Boots, or if you have this double jump, then you start at MacKenzie’s location and backtrack across the bridge.</p>

		
		

<p>On the map, look for Resin Creek, which adjoins with a save station. Here you’ll find a pool with two whipping tentacle plants, where you’ll find an elevated seed that you can blow up with a Psychic bomb. To reach it, bounce yourself up using a bomb, then place a second while in midair.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>If returning to or leaving Fury Green via cargo cannon, there’s a missile expansion off to one side up in the air. Double jump up and over the scenery to reach a place with hazy purple smudges that you can scan using the visor to turn into platforms, which you can just jump across using your Psychic Boots.</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>In the Cliffside Gate area, near to where you first obtained the Psychic Glove, look for the purple signs of psychic platforms, which you can create to lead up to a Missile Expansion on a ledge.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Between MacKenzie and the Cargo Cannon is a door locked by a Fire Shot lock. This leads to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room. Standing on the central plate and using the Psychic Visor lets you move a circular viewer along purple glowing channels, which you can move in and out in addition to left and right.</p>

		
		

<p>Lining this up with the stone balls opens them up, allowing you to set wooding pyres alight inside. Light all of these up and another grand door opens leading to a statue with a Shot Expansion waiting for you as a reward.</p>
<h3>Shot Expansion (7)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>In the Jungle Path area on the route you first took back after defeating the Fury Green boss, turn to the cliffside by the boss-side entrance and a flammable blocker can be destroyed, letting you morph ball and jump in to get a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (6)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>With the fire shot, you can grab a few more items by backtracking to the earlier part of Fury Green. In the circular path that you followed to meet MacKenzie, the Isopod Lair features a flammable obstacle which hides a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (8)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Keep backtracking to reach the Ravine Overlook area, where a flammable blocker exists in the roots under a tree. It hides another Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Ice Shot</em></p>
<p>With the Ice Shot newly unlocked, return to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room and unlock the ice door. This leads to a little puzzle room. Use the ice shot to lock the left platform being raised by water, then use the visor to grab the power mote and power up the right platform. Use the ice shot to lock this in place and then jump up to be able to reach the Shot Expansion on top of the structure.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>The container in the cargo preparation room next to home base needs to be shot on both ends with an electric bolt to award you a Shot Expansion.</p>

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Return to the ceremony area once more and now open up the electric locked room. Here you’ll find a puzzle that requires you to use the Psychic Visor to grab metal objects on the ceiling, pull them all down and turn them to point at the central structure. Now shoot each one with the Thunder Shot and you’ll be rewarded with a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve completed all three of the elemental puzzles, the statue next to the main Sacred Flame Ceremony room will dish out an Energy Tank for you. Handy!</p>

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Super Missile</em></p>
<p>Remember Betsy? You were introduced right at the start of the game! Once you’ve obtained the Super Missile you can revisit her and blow up the storage container by her feet to net yourself another Missile Expansion.</p>

<h3>Psychic Power Bomb Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Power Bomb</em></p>
<p>Back track to the earlier area of Fury Green and the Quiet Clearing. There’s a statue leaning off to the side here which says it contains something inside, when scanning. Use the huge explosion of the Power Bomb to break it up and reward you with… more power bombs!</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s everything there is to find in Fury Green!</p>
