		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>
