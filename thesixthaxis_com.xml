		<p>Among Ashes is going to be available from December 9th on PC via Steam and PS5, Rat Cliff Games has confirmed today. It was just a few weeks ago that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/among-ashes-has-been-confirmed-for-ps5/">Among Ashes was confirmed for PS5</a>. To celebrate this milestone, the studio has released a brand new trailer of the game where the horrors of videogames and reality clashes.</p>

<p>Among Ashes is a bit of a layered game in which players have to play a haunted videogame, called Night Call, and keep playing it until the very end. This means that in the game, your character will boot up the haunted game to play that and get through its challenges. In Night Call you will come across various monsters to fend off, but in the “real world” of Among Ashes the horrors are much more subtle and darker, delving more into psychological threats. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">demo available now on Steam for Among Ashes</a>, if you are in the mood to play a haunted video game.</p>
<p>Rat Cliff Games are self publishing the PC version of Among Ashes, while new publisher Dojo System will be publishing the PS5 version of the game.</p>
