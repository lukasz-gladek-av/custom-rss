		<p>Where can Mario Kart go after the sublime <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review/">Mario Kart 8</a>? That’s the question that we were wondering for the past 7 years, especially as Nintendo stuffed their deluxe best-seller with more and more tracks. The answer is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, an open-world spin on the traditional karting format that seriously mixes things up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pE23YTYEZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like putting on a pair of old slippers. It’s an utterly familiar feeling Mario Kart experience from the start, but it doesn’t take long to start spotting the bustle of new additions and extra features.</p>


<p>It starts with the character selector. There’s just a huge number of characters to choose from and their various costumes –&nbsp;these you unlock, it seems, by grabbing food items from roadside diners and then chowing down mid-race, which also transforms your look at that time. Of course you have staples like Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Waluigi, but the character list goes so far down the Mario universe as to just have Cow as a driver, which is as brilliant as it is barmy.</p>
<p>Get on track and you can literally just race it as though it’s Mario Kart 8, but there’s finer details to keep an eye out for. You can still pick up two items at once, but you no longer needing to hold and item behind you for protection as this now happens automatically. You also have the ability to grind on rails, which is trickier than it might look to pull off, wall-ride and more.</p>

<p>There’s some new transformations as well, with the karts all now having a boat or jetski mode to go with the road racing and glider modes.</p>

<p>We’ve played a handful of races with the game’s Grand Prix mode, but it’s not quite like the racing that you know from Mario Karts past. Where the point-to-point races of previous games were rare treats, here that aspect is folded into the main events. The demo build at the hands-on events picked randomly from the Grand Prix side of the game, and each time we found ourselves first racing cross-country until we reached the actual circuit that is home to the race. There’s no new race start at this point, the journey to the race track is as much a part of the race as the actual final circuit, and you might have 1 lap at that circuit, you might have three, or potentially more.</p>
<p>There’s just a huge amount of variety to this new structure, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together. Will custom races let you get that classic feel? Or will things constantly keep on remixing?</p>

<p>But what if you love those point-to-point races and just want them to be even bigger and more challenging? Knockout Tour is one long cross-country race, with checkpoints to blaze a trail towards and the final four drivers to reach that point being eliminated. From twenty-four racers at the start, it will chop the field down to just four by the time you’re racing for the win. It ramps up the pressure in a very different way, and the sheer number of players, the volume of pickups going off makes for some seriously topsy-turvy moments as you tumble from 5th to 19th and the cusp of getting completely knocked out as you come to the next time gate.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun, though, and shows that there’s wide open avenues for Nintendo still to explore with their biggest game franchise. There’s also no doubt tons about this game that is still yet to be revealed, with a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming on 17th April.</p>

		<p>The lines between console generations and hardware leaps have become so blurred in the last few years. It almost doesn’t make sense to me that The Last of Us Part II is already five years old, nor does the reminder that it was originally a PlayStation 4 game feel like any more of a truthful statement. A big part of that is a combination of just how incredibly good this game has always looked, combined with the increasingly shrinking amount of space new games have left to innovate or expand on graphical technology. It already felt like we hit the apex with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">the original PS4 release of this game</a>, and seeing just how gorgeous it is on PC makes it even harder to believe it isn’t actually a cutting-edge, brand new game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Announcement Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6MdexNSy3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of modern PlayStation exclusives is the absolute overload of accessibility options and fine-tuning settings they pack into their releases. The recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">PS5 re-release of The Last of Us II</a> added an impressive number of these to the game, beyond what was already there on PS4, and they’re all included in this PC release as well. A lot of them are gameplay altering options that lessen or remove certain instances in combat, and options to retool a lot of button-holds and presses to taps or triggers. There’s a refreshing amount of UI options, as well, including welcome sizing options for the HUD and subtitles that would make playing the game on a large screen or from a far non-desktop distance a lot easier.</p>



<p>On top of these tools, there’s a massive array of new graphical and display settings available for the PC version of the game. All the frame generation and upscaling methods you’d hope for are included here – with AMD’s FSR 3.1 and 4, Nvidia’s DLSS 3 with Frame Gen, and Intel XeSS support. There’s also solid ultrawide screen support, with the option to even toggle cinematic pillarboxes on or off if you dare.</p>

<p>There’s all the graphical settings you would expect from a native PC release, with things like texture quality, LOD, volumetrics, shadows and more all scalable. I was also happy to see the amount of control The Last of Us II gives you over visual effect intensity on PC. You’ve got sliders for film grain, lens dirt, chromatic aberration, and camera shake, letting those who dislike certain effects tune them down or turn them off. Some of the finer options go a bit over my head, but what’s obvious is that the game looks great and runs great.</p>
<p>Without doing in-depth benchmarks across dozens of GPUs and configurations, my GeForce 3080 handled the game with ease. I get crisp visuals at 1440P and nearly maxed out settings alongside the game hovering around 120FPS in cutscenes and floating between 60-90FPS in gameplay.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Part II is also verified for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> – and while it’s certainly a consistent experience on the hybrid Valve handheld, it’s also without a doubt a highly compromised experience. Visuals take a noticeable hit on this platform, even with heavy FSR upscaling applied. I wouldn’t see myself enjoying the narrative-heavy material of the game in this way.</p>
<p>I did, however, enjoy a couple hours of the roguelike No Return mode on my Steam Deck, since it’s so much more of a combat focused experience where visual fidelity and lighting effects don’t matter nearly as much to me. This mode has been expanded a little for the PC release, with the new content being patched into the PS5 release as well. There’s new characters brought forward from TLOU Part I with Bill and Marlene giving new playstyles, and there’s four new maps to help sprinkle a little more variety into your runs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing compromised about The Last of Us II&nbsp;on PC. Even the previously controversial PSN account requirements touted for Helldivers II and God of War: Ragnarok on PC are fully optional this time around for The Last of Us II. If you want to experience this chapter of Naughty Dog’s harrowing post-apocalyptic epic, you’re in for just as much of a rewarding journey on PC as you would be on PS5.</p>
