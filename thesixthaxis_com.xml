<ul>
<li>Chained Whirl Slash now can be performed after Overhead Strike.</li>

<p>????&nbsp;<i>While it was clear that its a very powerful weapon in PTS, we don’t want to reduce its effectiveness, but we do want to raise its skill cap.</i></p>

<li><u>Emergency Countermeasure</u>: Cooldown is decreased from 90 to 45 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Vanguard</u></b></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i>For too long, Vanguard’s role was to be a vessel for the squad’s healing perks. With these changes, we want to reinforce ranged/melee hybrid playstyle for him. But we are not entirely done with Vanguard changes. We would like to take a closer look at his ability.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><u>Grapnel Launcher</u>&nbsp;damage now scales based on difficulty.</li>

<ul>
<li>????&nbsp;<u>Tenacity</u>: The perk has been reworked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Old:&nbsp;<i>“After killing 10 enemies within 5 seconds, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 40% for 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>New:<i>&nbsp;“After a Ranged kill Majoris-level or higher enemy, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 130%. Cooldown 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i><b>Change from PTS:</b>&nbsp;Fix interaction between Shock Wave perk and Tenacity caused by double damage scaling.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><u>Collateral Damage</u>: Increase damage by Diving Kick to 50%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><b>Surgical Strike:</b>&nbsp;Buffed damage by 15%.</li>
<li><b>Extreme Challenge:&nbsp;</b>Increased Extremis enemies spawn cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay QoL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased netcode damage cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>????<i>&nbsp;This change is going to open a huge can of worms for gameplay balancing, but it has to be done. The game damage numbers should not be restricted by net code and should be accurate all of the time. We will be monitoring which builds and perks combinations will become problematic. It’s pretty clear that some damage buffs combinations from multiple sources are already insane (looking at you Blocking Power Fist). For now, have fun.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Sniper damage buff from Cloak Ability lasts a little bit longer to fully affect entire burst and full auto weapons.</li>
<li>Improved sound indication for unparriable attacks.</li>

<li>Lots of minor customisation fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>LEVELS</h2>
<p>Lots of minor fixes with level geometry.</p>
<h2>GENERAL FIXES</h2>
<ul>

<li>Fixed: Sniper ability stops recharging and working completely until the end of the match after getting hit during its activation in rare cases.</li>
<li>Fixed: Player can’t use gun strike on Lictor after perfect dodge in some rare cases.</li>

<p>Set to release this week on 27th November, update 1.0.2 for Age of Imprisonment with bring multiple new challenges into the game for after you’ve cleared the main story. These appear as both Battle Challenges and Hyrule Challenges. Beating these will be how you unlock two new weapons, the Greatsword of Light and the Spear of the Upper Guard. There’s also some new attacks for you to learn to clear that screen of enemies.</p>


<p>Beyond that, update 1.0.2 does also bring a bunch of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Here’s the full (web browser translated and touched up) patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Update 1.0.2:</p>
<h2>Add new challenges and rewards</h2>
<div>
<h3>Adding a new challenge</h3>
<p>Multiple <strong>“Battle Challenges” </strong>and <strong>“Hyrule Challenges” </strong>will be added as elements after clearing the main story.<br>
New “dangerous species” such as Bokoblin and Sludgelikes have appeared. ” “Scra Attack” such as “Boko Slash”, which is activated using materials obtained from “Bokoblin (Dangerous Species)”, has been significantly improved compared to previous materials.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>New weapons added</h3>
<p>The “Greatsword of Light”, a special great sword blessed by Raura with the protection of the power of light, and the “Spear of the Upper Guard”, a spear given to the elite directly under King of Hyrule, will be added. These new weapons can be equipped with mysterious golems and warriors of various races.</p>
<p><em>You can get it by clearing the battles added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New dedicated sync strike</h3>
<p>A dedicated sync strike will be added to Zelda and Karamo. Zelda chases the boomerang thrown by Karamo with the power of time. If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and the attack will become powerful.</p>
<p><em>You can learn it by clearing the Hyrule Challenge added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fighting with Block Golems</h3>
<p>It will be possible to activate the sync strike with the block golem. Its powerful rotating attack kicks Zako and cuts the week point gauge of the strong enemy.</p>
<p><em>In addition to the battles added in this update, it can also be activated in existing battles where Block Golems appear.</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above, the following will be added as new battles.
<ul>
<li>“Battle with the serious Raura”</li>
<li>“Battle to get a lot of Pou”</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Improvements</h2>
<h3>Action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed the special actions of the mysterious golem so that they can be saved for each weapon type</li>
<li>Added a warning sound before the end of the effect of the unique skills “Limit Break” and “Inexhaustible Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed to be able to select characters and weapons in “training room”</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the recovery amount when selecting “Special Carry-on Food” and “Spare Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Departure preparation screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the “Friends” screen of preparation for departure, change to fly to “Tweet Challenge” with the [Y] button</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Map</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the tutorials displayed on the Hyrule map to the list</li>
<li>Visualize the area division on the ground on the Hyrule Map</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the area that can be recovered when the cursor is adjusted to the liberation battle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the list of Hyrule Challenges, the items that can be cleared have been changed to yellow.</li>
<li>Adjust the display of the clear status of the Hyrule Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>Several problems have been fixed, including the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique skill “Golem Launch” is not affected by some special effects and enhancements.</li>
<li>The tweeting challenge “Defeat 〇〇 enemies with Zonaugear” is not counted even if the conditions are met by strong attacks and air battles in Zonaugear.</li>
<li>Even if the secret function “Autoguard with a certain probability and the enemy is electrocuted/freeze/flaming” is activated by Deggama’s attack, and even if the enemy is automatically guarded, it will not be in the state of attributes assumed by the enemy.</li>
<li>If you “Switch Characters” from the pose menu, the enhanced state may be released.</li>
<li>When you select “Retry” after a specific operation, the BGM may not sound after that.</li>
<li>Inability to proceed in Ososowaku communication occurs</li>
<li>When a communication disconnect occurs in Share communication, the attack will not hit a specific enemy.</li>
<li>When playing the screen split 2P, if you select “Retry” after a specific operation, you may return to “Hyrule Map”</li>
<li>In the screen split 2P play, when Matsuba and sync strike are activated, the camera rotation operation is reversed.</li>
<li>Some screen display problems</li>
</ul>
<p>We rather enjoyed Age of Imprisonment, as the latest in the Hyrule Warriors spin-off series, and as a canonical prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Dom said, “This is a playful and enjoyable piece of Legend of Zelda lore, and one that will be essential for fans of the series, but it doesn’t break the same ground as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, or even Age of Calamity.”</p>
