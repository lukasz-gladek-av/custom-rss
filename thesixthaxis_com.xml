		<p>Take-Two Interactive has announced the sale of their indie games publishing label Private Division, though hasn’t revealed who that is. Despite previous statements, they have also confirmed that developers Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale.</p>
<p>Details of the buyer will be revealed “relatively soon”, Take-Two Interactive Software CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz.</p>


<p>As part of the sale, the buyer now takes on all of Private Division’s catalogue of games and future projects, with the sole exception being Moon Studios’ action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, which entered Steam Early Access back in April. Other games, such as Weta Workshop’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> has gone with the publishing label.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/02/take-two-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-studio-roll7-kerbal-space-program-2s-intercept-games/">Private Division was closing down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games</a>, seemingly as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/take-two-layoffs-hit-5-of-staff-games-cancelled/">Take-Two’s cost-cutting measures</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Take-Two insisted that KSP2 would still receive updates, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">Zelnick publicly claimed</a> that the studios hadn’t been closed down. That statement was a big fat untruth, considering the WARN notices of job losses that were already available.</p>

<p>As for why they’re selling Private Division now? Zelnick just thinks indie games and smaller projects aren’t big enough to be worth Take-Two’s time.</p>
<p>Speaking to GI.biz, he said, “The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well. However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we’re in the business of making great big hits.”</p>
<p>Take-Two, naturally, has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the pipeline.</p>

			<p>As someone of a certain age, I’ve never really got into podcasts – a reaction not helped by the fact that everybody and their dog seem to have one nowadays. In fact I think I’ve actually been on more podcasts than I’ve actually listened to… That said, I can see the appeal of long form audio treatments of interesting topics, and especially the kind of spooky or dark content that works so well in that format. Dark and Deep takes the genre of conspiracy and haunted podcasts and weaves it into a disturbing and twisted tale with a truly unique artstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark and Deep Launch Trailer [ON STEAM AUGUST 13]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7KP0nurg5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central premise of Dark and Deep concerns the question of who is Samuel Judge, an IT specialist and loner who may be wrapped up in mysterious conspiracies. You play as the aforementioned Samuel and must unravel the increasingly weird situations you are thrust into whilst only relying on the hints revealed through enigmatic webchat conversations and snippets of the Dark and Deep podcast. What transpires feels like a fever dream that takes you from an argument over a stolen sandwich to deadly encounters with ghostly snakes and more.</p>


<p>Booting up Dark and Deep immediately strikes you with the singular vision of its distinctive artstyle. Solo dev Walter Woods has spent years immersed in the beautifully Gothic aesthetics of nineteenth century artist, Gustav Doré, and the result is as effective as it is unique. The environments you explore are made up of the monochromatic hash effects that characterise Dore’s style interspersed with more photo realistic modern offices and server rooms. This combination creates a techno-Gothic dreamy Hellscape that is perhaps Dark and Deep’s greatest feature.</p>


<p>Playing from a first-person perspective, exploration is mostly linear, aside from some puzzles that require a certain amount of backtracking. This approach works well to push you forward and the final build is much more focused and streamlined than the demo one I played a few months back. Aside from navigating the environments you will be blocked by some puzzles that require you to make use of a number of mysterious picture frames that you find and also drops of ember – bright shining orbs that power strange devices and move obstacles. A certain amount of platforming is needed to progress and it is here that the game sometimes falls down (or at least the character does…) as falling sends you back to the beginning of the section and can become frustrating –&nbsp;even with updates to improve collision detection.</p>
<p>The first of the frames you find reveals hidden objects and handholds on walls, whilst the next is used to destroy the skulking enemies who try to sabotage you by stealing ember. Later ones have other specific powers which I won’t spoil here and there a number of areas that force you to switch between them to progress. The overall loop is therefore set but the different frames do allow for a decent amount of variety within what could have been a very straight forward walking sim setup.</p>

<p>Storytelling here is kept to a minimum in order to ensure that you constantly feel on edge, but the mood is more of suspense than straight out horror. Throughout the levels you’ll occasionally come across computer desks which can be interacted with to read chat logs and listen to the eponymous podcasts. This slow drip feed of information is effective and even by the game’s ending there are questions left to ponder.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark and Deep is a focused and atmospheric title that doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. Most of this time is spent immersed in the unique aesthetic and it stands out amongst the many other copycat PT wannabes that flood the horror tag on Steam. The ending is interesting although some of the imagery felt too separated from the Doré influence and instead moved into more conventional folk horror. All in all, Dark and Deep is a well polished and fascinating indie horror that has a look and feel all of its own, and for that it deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>
