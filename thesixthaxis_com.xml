		<p>Portal-filled arena shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is getting its full 1.0 launch this week on 6th June across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you don’t want to wait, the game is already available to play in open beta across all platforms.</p>
<p>1047 Games announced the game’s launch in the run up to Summer Game Fest, during which a “massive surprise” is still set to be revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Something to Fight For | Launch Announcement | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, while Friday will be the 1.0 launch, the game is already playable in its current open beta, which will continue through to launch and track all player stats and progression through to the full game as well.</p>
<p>The open beta doesn’t have all of the game’s maps and modes just yet, but it does have the core of the game and the fully featured level editor, The Lab, which allows up to 16 people to collaborate on a custom map.</p>

<p>Another thing that the beta has had over the past couple weeks is server issues. 1047 Games has battled to get on top of these, which have blocked player progression from being awarded in real-time, and forced them to scramble to find fixes. That’s always the way for online multiplayer games, it seems.</p>
<p>Still, the game has had over 1 million downloads already, and anyone that has donwloaded and logged in during the beta will receive some poo-themed cosmetics by way of apology for server issues. So that’s… nice?</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. A few years on and they’re now on the cusp of realising that vision.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the next State of Play stream will take place tomorrow, 4th June, at 10PM UK time (2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST).</p>
<p>The show will last around 40 minutes and will have the usual mix of news, updates, reveals and trailers for games coming to PlayStation 5.</p>


<p>You can find the stream embedded here:</p>

<p>Of course, we’re taking our first steps into the faux-E3 season wrapped up around Summer Game Fest. The main SGF stream will take place on Friday, 6th June at 10PM UK time, with Day of the Devs coming right after at midnight. We’ve then got Xbox Games Showcase with Outwer Worlds 2 Direct on 8th June, as well as the PC Gaming Show and Death Stranding 2 Game Premier a little behind, and there’s Devolver, Wholesome Direct, and a variety of other curated showcases for specific groups of the indsutry, including Black Voices, Southeast Asian, Latin American and Women-Led games.</p>

<p>While a State of Play stream had been rumoured and expected for this time of year, Sony decided to wait until just about the last possible moment before confirming the date and time of the showcase. No idea why, but there we go.</p>
