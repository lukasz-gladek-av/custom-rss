		<p>Today, Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ marking the game’s inclusion at EVO France 2025 this weekend, and within that trailer the publisher made a surprise annoucement. Goku from Dragon Ball Daima will be added to the Dragon Ball FighterZ roster, with the new character expected to be added in Spring 2026. In addition, a balance update was also announced. Check out the reveal trailer below.</p>

<p>The balance update for Dragon Ball FighterZ will be released on October 12th, with Z-Reflect being one of the key parts of the game being addressed. In addition, all characters on the roster have been updated so moves will be rebalanced across the board, though full patch notes will not be released until the balance update is released.</p>
<p>Released back in 2018, Dragon Ball FighterZ was a major hit for fighting game vets&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a>, followed by numerous updates and character additions. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote, <em>“2018 is off to a strong start with Dragon Ball FighterZ an early contender for this year’s best fighting game. &nbsp;By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</em></p>
