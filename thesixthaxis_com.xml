		<p>Ubisoft has announced a round of layoffs, cutting 185 jobs from across its European studios, and closing one studio down completely.</p>
<p>UK-based Ubisoft Leamington is being shut down, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">Eurogamer reporting</a> that almost all of its 50 team members are being laid off. Beyond that, there’s also “targeted restructuring” that will affect Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p>


<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-cuts-185-jobs-in-a-bid-to-prioritise-projects-and-reduce-costs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a Ubisoft spokesperson said:</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition.</p>

<p>The news comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">Ubisoft announced the closure of XDefiant</a>, laying off team members from San Francisco, Sydeny and Osaka.</p>
<p>There’s no end in sight, it seems, for the struggles being faced across the industry. Earlier this month a Transformers game was cancelled, affecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/transformers-reactivate-has-been-cancelled-staff-to-be-laid-off/">Splash Damage</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">People Can Fly also laid off 120 in December</a> after a project cancellation.</p>
<p>As always, our thoughts are with those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they can find new work soon.</p>
