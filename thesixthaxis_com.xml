		<p>So, you know the DualSense controller? That, but Kratos. Or, in other words, take a white DualSense, put a big red stripe down one side and some nice red buttons.&nbsp;That’s all they have done really, and that makes it very annoying that I love it and want one.</p>

<p>“In honor of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a>’s 20th anniversary this year, we were thrilled by the opportunity to celebrate this milestone with a new DualSense controller design,” said Associate Art Director Dela Longfish from Santa Monica Studio.</p>
<p>“When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo. No matter which God of War game you’re playing, the shape of his red ink against the gray of his ash-covered skin is one of the most iconic elements of Kratos’ look across both Greek and Norse sagas. Our team made sure to represent both of these key tones in the color selection for the controller to make every aspect an authentic homage to the design that has defined Kratos for over two decades. ”</p>
<p>“We hope fans enjoy the controller and can’t thank everyone enough for all of the support you’ve shown Santa Monica Studio over the years!”</p>

<p>The God of War 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense will be available in limited quantities for a eyebrow raising recommended retail price of $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders start on October 3, 2025 at 10am local time at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a> (for U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) as well as participating retailers globally.</p>
<p>There’s still a couple of months left in the year so maybe we will get something else to celebrate God of War’s 20th birthday. Maybe a look at that highly rumoured next game set in Egypt? Maybe? Please? Go on Sony.</p>

		<p>Tucked away in the State of Play stream was the confirmation of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games line up for October 2025, with Sony bringing a fantastic horror game to the table for the spookiest month of the year. Have you seen Alan lately?</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus October 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 7th October</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Goat Simulator 3</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Cocoon&nbsp;</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation Plus - Game Catalog for 2025 | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1X6lPM-0qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is a great headliner for this month’s PS Plus games. After a thirteen year wait, Remedy returned to the setting of one of their most beloved games, but took a distinctly more horror-tinged tone compared to the Xbox 360 original. Still, that totally worked for us. Nick gave it a glowing 10/10, and said:</p>

<p><em>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror. Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 Review –&nbsp;Worth the wait" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qi7NHf15a5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How do you top that? Well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cocoon">Cocoon</a> is a simply sublime little puzzle adventure with worlds nested in worlds. It’s “a beautiful experience that marries a gorgeous aesthetic with increasingly complex puzzles that really push you to experiment with the game’s mechanics,” Steve said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/cocoon-review/">our review</a>. “Whilst it isn’t a long or excessively challenging game, I would urge you to absorb yourselves in its dimension-hopping delights.”</p>

<p>And then you can go all the way into the left field for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a>, the latest entry in the meme-able game series. The game launched back in 2022, with Pilgor the goat going on many an adventure which, through DLC, has included some dimension hopping of its own.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 6th Ocober September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/septembers-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>
