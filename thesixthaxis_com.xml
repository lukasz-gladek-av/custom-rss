		<p>Sony has announced that there will be a State of Play taking place on September 3rd, with the sole focus of the show being IO Interactive’s 007 First Light. The State of Play will last 30 minutes and will feature the development team, who will reveal new gameplay and dive into what player can expect when they play the game.</p>

<p>007 First Light is set right at the start of James Bond’s career as a 00 agent, with his first mission seemingly pitting him against 009. 009 appears to have gone rogue and has their own plans, which cannot come to fruition. The announcement trailer showed some gameplay, which had some hallmarks of the Hitman games like taking down guards. The 007 First Light State of Play will surely go much further into how you will infiltrate places and sneak around as Bond, as well as detail the weapons and gadgets that will be available to you.</p>
<p>The 007 First Light State of Play will start 11am PT / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST on September 3rd. 007 First Light is expected to release in 2026 for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
