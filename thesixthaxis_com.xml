		<p>Felt That Boxing will likely be one of the most fun announcements from Summer Games Fest, as it is a brand new boxing game. Instead of big name boxers, Felt That Boxing puts you in the gloves of Fuzz-E who is trying to climb the boxing ladder to save the orphanage he grew up in. The trailer gives you a brief look at gameplay elements, including some unorthodox training and some mismatched boxing matches.</p>

<p>Felt That Boxing will have a story mode lasting around 8 to 12 hours, and every match has been described as a boss fight. It is an arcade style experience too, featuring power ups like anvil drops and pie throwing. You will be able to unlock different customisation options for Fuzz-E too as you make progress in Felt That Boxing.</p>
<p>Felt That Boxing is available to wishlist on Steam, and release date is yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Atomic Heart developers Mundfish have revealed not one, but two successors to their 2022 first person shooter. Atomic Heart 2 will be a spiritual successor to the first game, while The Cube is an MMORPG shooter also set within the shared style and setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Heart 2 - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fquBSxalY1Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Atomic Heart 2 looks to bring much more freedom to the game, described on the SGF stage by Geoff Keighley as being a “spiritual successor” and having greater emphasis on RPG freedoms. There is still plenty of common style to the retro futuristic technology and global setting, taking a bit of a step away from the Soviet setting of the first game, but with plenty of crossover in terms of what the tech looks like. We do see much more freedom in the form of hang gliding and broader environments.</p>
<p><iframe title="The CUBE - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHHJM-KZfss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Cube, meanwhile, is an MMORPG shooter in the same kind of setting. Here it’s all about head-to-head shooter action where a giant cube has revealed itself to the world… maybe… and this provides an ever-shifting battlefield.</p>

<p>We said of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/23/atomic-heart-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">original game</a>:</p>
<p><em>Atomic Heart is a bit of a surprise. It’s not perfect and the open world is an unneeded dilution, but when you’re in the story missions it’s always entertaining, despite occasionally dragging things out a little. It can be a bit strange, but it’s the self aware kind of strange that can be a bit charming. And the robots are pretty great.</em></p>

		<p>Code Vein II, a sequel to the 2019 Soulslike by Bandai Namco, has been revealed. The game is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, coming in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRRhNJ_25U4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“If time were a weapon to wield, could you undo the sins of ruin? Bound By Blood, Revenants gather once more,” says the trailer blurb.</p>
<p>Of course, the game isn’t really doing much to dispel the notion that it’s an anime Soulslike. In fact, it seems to lean even further into the Souls-y vibes than the first game. There’s plenty of huge horrors and dark fantasy here, and then there’s some big portals and giant bosses. You do get to ride a motorbike, though.</p>
<p>When Miguel reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">Code Vein</a>, aka Anime Souls, he wrote:</p>

<p><em>Code Vein is addictive, yet frustrating. It’s promising, yet unpolished. There are a lot of interesting ideas here that come together to craft a unique and engaging experience. I just wish that the flaws here weren’t so glaring, because they keep Code Vein from being a great game instead of just a good one.</em></p>

		<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has been given release date and the new racing game will be out on September 25th. Additionally, SEGA has confirmed that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will feature cross platform play, so you can race online against players on other platforms. There was a slightly cheeky comment about a certain other kart racer not being able to do that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzhXbukaCSU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer also revealed three new guest characters for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds including Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like A Dragon, and Joker from Persona 5. Additionally, there was also a tease with a Minecraft crossover, though details are scant on that. The game’s description says, “<em>“Race across land, sea, air, space, and time in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds! Warp through Travel Rings into new dimensions where something new awaits around every twist and turn. Speed to victory solo or as a team in a variety of offline and online modes and compete against players from around the world. Build the ultimate machine to match your racing style, unlock special skills to gain the upper hand, and unleash power-up items for the win!”</em></p>
