		<p>Publisher Big Fan Games has announced that John Wick Hex is going to be delisted from all platforms on July 17th, but a reason behind this delisting was not given. In a statement, Big Fan Games did state that anyone who has a digital copy of the game already on any platform will still be able to play John Wick Hex after the game is delisted, and physical copies of the game will not be impacted either.</p>

<p>The full statement about the John Wick Hex delisting from Big Fan Games reads, <em>“John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025.After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront.”</em></p>
<p>John Wick Hex was developed by Bithell Games, with Mike Bithell taking to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3ltxcisuy2c22">BlueSky</a> to give his own thoughts on the delisting, but he has not been able to give the reason for the delisting. He said, <em>“Pour one out (and pick up a copy asap if you want one). This one was a weird journey.. initially polarised folks, but now it’s one of the consistent favourites people wanna chat with me about when I’m doing public stuff. My first disappeared game, a weird feeling. It’s legacy will be that you can watch me getting my arse kicked on the John Wick 3 special features by the eventual director of Love Hurts. My pink face will echo through eternity.”</em></p>

<p>In our John Wick Hex review, Miguel said, <em>“John Wick Hex is the last form you might expect a John Wick game to take, but this unique, inventive puzzler kept my mind racing from beginning to end. While the gameplay and interesting story shed light on some important aspects of the film franchise, the sometimes punishing difficulty and surprising lack of focus on John Wick himself left me a little disappointed. This isn’t a perfect video game adaptation of a film, but it’s certainly the most original one I’ve ever played.”</em></p>
