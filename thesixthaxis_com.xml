<p>Here’s a smidgeon of story:</p>
<p>Fifteen years before A Plague Tale: Requiem, young Sophia seeks her independence as a fierce plunderer in the unforgiving world of the 14th century.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot of really interesting imagery alongside that, including something a tiny bit roman, no?</p>

<p>We said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/17/a-plague-tale-requiem-review/">A Plague Tale Requiem</a>, “A Plague Tale: Requiem gave me the chills. The graphics, sound design and writing are all phenomenal, and the gameplay is fantastic. There are a few issues with sneaking sections feeling samey, the puzzles being a little too easy, but these are forgivable for just how excellent Amicia and Hugo are as characters. If you enjoyed the first game, or you’re just looking for something narratively compelling, Requiem is the game for you.”</p>

		<p>Ahead of the dedicated stream that follows the Xbox Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, revealing that the game will launch on 29th October 2025.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, of course, but it’s also launching for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>. Of course it’s day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, which might have you sticking with team Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUDdFBFTYRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
