		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed Tropico 7 for 2026, with the game confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox Game Pass. This new entry into the long running series will introduce new elements including face to face talks with different faction leaders, and the ability to terraform the island to suit your own needs. If a river is not running in the direction you like, feel free to reroute it. You also be able to pick different dictatorship styles depending on political affiliations and the use of edicts.</p>

<p><em>“With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics — giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love,”</em> says Daniel Dumont, Studio and Creative Director at Gaming Minds Studios. <em>“This isn’t just a sequel, it’s the ultimate sandbox for would-be dictators. El Presidente would say: ‘The best Tropico ever — because it’s mine!’”</em></p>

<p>In our Tropico 6 review, Nick said, <em>“Tropico 6 feels like the kind of game that you can fall back on when every other game gets a little too stressful. The economy can be tricky to get started, but you can soon start to kick back and take it easy. If you are finding it too hard though, turn on unlimited money and enjoy your break. It’s almost like going on holiday to the Caribbean, which is fitting really.”</em></p>

		<p>11 bit Studios has released a brand new trailer for the console version of Frostpunk 2, which shows how the development team has adapted the game for controller use. The console version of Frostpunk 2 will make use of radial menus for a lot of aspects of the game, including construction of the city, decision making, and exploration. The user interface has been designed so console players can easily navigate the menus and options that make up the gameplay of Frostpunk 2, and you can see it in action below.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the events of the original Frostpunk, taking players into the age of oil and all of the issues that come with that, both technological as your society moves on from coal and social strife that will divide the inhabitants.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a>&nbsp;game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a>&nbsp;<em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</em></p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September,</p>
