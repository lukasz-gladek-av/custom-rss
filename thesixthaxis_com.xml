			<p>Sometimes a video game is an epic. It’s daunting, and it’s forever, and it’s a slate of marble you slowly chip away at for weeks and months and an entire year. Other times, a video game is lightning and fireworks. It’s an instant flash, and immediate dopamine, and a bag of chips that’s empty before you know it but also maybe empty before you have too much of it. It’s Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shotgun Cop Man |  Weapons Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F6Vk0TcbmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;puts arcade action and mechanical perfection above all else. As the follow-up to indie sleeper hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">My Friend Pedro</a>,&nbsp;it’s stripped down and simplified in a lot of ways to achieve that. There’s a story here in the loosest and most barely defined sense of the word: you are shotgun cop man, and you need to go to hell to arrest Satan. It’s and instant, charmingly stupid setup to get you straight to the business in a way that’s reminiscent of the most experimental Adult Swim cartoons. Don’t worry about why you’re here, just accept that you are here and have fun.</p>


<p>Your journey through Hell takes the form of a sidescrolling twitch-precision platformer, but you don’t have a jump button. Instead you have a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. The kick of the shotgun gives a rocket-jump level of bounce when fired, and the pistol keeps you afloat and just barely manoeuvrable while in mid-air. Both weapons have limited clip sizes, but they reload the instant you touch the ground. Every level has an exit and a slew of demons, traps, and platforms in the way of it, tasking you with learning the ropes of your momentum-based toolkit to safely navigate there.</p>


<p>Shotgun Cop Man does a great job of consistently dishing out new elements through each level and chapter of the campaign to keep the challenge fresh and justify the 100+ levels you’ll be shotgun-hopping through. New weapons give you alternative ways to dispose of enemies and unique momentum-modifiers, while the increasing array of traps and obstacles keep you guessing. I love that the game is incredibly challenging, but also refreshingly forgiving in how it lets you tackle those challenges – upon death, you can instantly load back into a checkpoint in the middle of the level, and the game is incredibly generous with the placement of these checkpoints, often dumping you right back where you died each time.</p>
<p>You can die and hop back in as many times as you need to in order to finish a level, but each level comes with a trio of completion challenges tasking you with defeating every enemy, beating it without dying, and beating it in a certain time limit. You don’t have to complete all of these challenges for each stage, but they offer a nice incentive to slowly wean yourself off the checkpoint system as you become more confident in your shotgun-copping skills.</p>

<p>That variety in level design and mechanics I mentioned earlier, sadly, isn’t reflected nearly as well in the other areas of the game. Every level of Shotgun Cop Man looks practically identical to the last, sporting black level geometry on a gloomy darkened background that means they all blend together. The lack of environmental variety, or even some basic colour palette swaps makes every chapter blend together. Even in the game’s custom campaign editor, which lets you freely draw out and share your own custom levels or chapters online, you have no options for visual customisation or even song selection. I love a game with Workshop mod support and custom content options, but when these options only provide mechanical alterations and no aesthetic or visual ones, I can’t imagine there being much room for creativity in the kind of custom campaigns we’ll see from this game.</p>
<p>It’s still an absolute treat to blast through hundreds of demons in Shotgun Cop Man and master the finicky art of shotgun-jumping, I just wish there was a bit more care put into offering some visual and auditory variety to make each moment of the game stand out a bit more from the last. It’s an impressive and incredibly addictive experience nonetheless, but ends up being a blast of fireworks that’s over just a bit sooner than you were hoping for.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shotgun Cop Man is fast-paced and fluid platforming bliss that evolves mechanically through the game, but it lacks any kind of visual variety to help make the hundred or so levels stand out from each other in any meaningful way.	</p></div>

		<p>Gearbox has shared a first real look at Borderlands 4 gameplay with a dedicated State of Play stream hosted by Sony. Borderlands 4 is set to launch on 12th September 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC, with the release date having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">brought forward by two week</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay deep dive, played on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson, the gameplay deep dive saw the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>
<h2>Borderlands 4 Setting and Story</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 takes us to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>

<p>Set after the rogue moon is teleported away from Pandora at the end of Borderlands 3 and into the orbit of Kairos, the planet has suffered devastating effects that have thrown the enforced order of the Timekeeper into disarray. The ordinary populace that had been happily controlled by their rulers.</p>
<h2>Campaign &amp; Co-op</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 has a new lobby system that allows for full cross-play between platforms.</p>
<p>Local split-screen is returning.</p>
<p>And you can set independent difficulty levels for each player.</p>
<p>Obviously you’ll want to play through the main story, but Borderlands 4 has full mission and boss replay, so you can revisit parts of the game and don’t need to use saves to fight bosses a second time.</p>
<h2>World Activities</h2>
<p>The demo took us to the frigid zone of Terminus Range, one of four zones that are featured in the game as large open worlds to explore. Dynamic weather effects and dynamic events can take place to give you fresh activities.</p>
<p>The main mission here was to break into a secret blacksite in the mountains on the hunt for Lillith, but along the way a silo that needed to be hacked to unlock the tech within and boost the rebellion (and provide zipline points to shoot you up into the sky with he balloon that emerges).</p>
<p>Finding Vault Key Fragments can eventually unlock access to a high level dungeon with challenging combat and the top tier loot rewards.</p>
<h2>New Vault Hunters</h2>
<p>Two new Vault Hunters were revealed: Vex, the new Siren in the game who uses supernatural Phase energy to either empower herself or summon purple spectral creatures to fight alongside, and Rafa, a former TDR soldier with an experimental exo suit, who can unleach arc knives around them in a swirl pain.</p>
<p>Each Vault Hunter has three Action Skills to choose between, giving a unique unlock tree that can be further tweaked using Cap Stones. These can be amended on the fly or fully respec’d back at town.</p>
<p>Each character also has a passive Trait. For Vex, her summons can attune to the elemental damage of the weapon in her hand, so you can have a fire cat running around alongside you.</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>All weapons and gear comes from one of eight manufacturers, with Jakobs, Maliwan, Vladog, Tediore and Togue returning alongside the new Order (charge and release), Ripper (full blast), and Daedalus (multiple ammo types) manufacturers.</p>
<p>In a great new twist, weapons can be customised with Licensed Parts from different manufacturers to lend properties of one to another and give you more control over how they work.</p>
<p>Enhancements replace Artefacts from previous games, providing specific boosts to weapons that include parts from a certain manufacturer.</p>
<p>A separate gear slot is reserved for Ordinance, your heaviest weapons like launchers and machine guns. These are not ammo-limited but instead are available on a cooldown to make them constantly useful.</p>
<h2>Looting</h2>
<p>Gearbox has heard the complaints over Borderlands 3’s looting, and looked to completely rebalance the system. In particular, Legendary weapons in Borderlands 3 were too common, while other good to great weapons were too difficult to find. So loot found in crates should generally be more rewarding now, while Legendary weapons are less frequent and should feel much more special.</p>
<p>Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<h2>Movement and Combat</h2>
<p>There’s a bunch of new movement abilities that work both while exploring the world and when in combat. Glide, double jump, dash, grapple, they give a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>These really came to the fore in a huge boss battle that forced the pair to keep jumping around and moving to dodge purple blasts of energy.</p>
<p>You also always have access to a personal Digi Runner hover vehicle that can be customised with fresh paint jobs, and also gives you another offensive option with its guns.</p>
<p>You can also fast travel to friends if you get separated.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s everything we spotted in the quick-moving gameplay deep dive, and Borderlands 4 is looking pretty good if you ask us! Stay tuned for more, with a tease of a first hands on in June, leading up to release in September.</p>
