		<p>Playing With History, a new book based on TSA’s ongoing feature series, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">has officially launched its crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>From cinematic samurai epics to world-conquering strategy games, Ade and Jim will explore a wide spectrum of titles, from AAA blockbusters to indie gems and everything in between. Playing With History is set to feature over 200 pages of deep dives and interviews and will be available both physically and digitally with optional premium upgrades as well as a backer-exclusive early bird discount.</p>
<p>For anyone who has read PWH in the past or wants to learn more about how history inspires your favourite video games, we’d love your support. If you want an early look at what we’ve been working on, a free preview (PDF) is available to download now.</p>



<p>If you want even more PWH, then you’re in luck! We’ve put together an archive below – a number of these will be adapted and expanded for the new book, alongside exclusive stories and interviews. If you’d like to reach out with feedback and suggestions, you can find Playing With History on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playingwithhistory.bsky.social">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/PlayingxHistory">X</a>.</p>
