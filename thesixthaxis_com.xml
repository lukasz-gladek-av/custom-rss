		<p>March’s PlayStation Plus monthly games have been announced, and it’s a very mixed bag with three big franchises.</p>
<p>First up, fans of loud trousers and little balls will be delighted with PGA Tour 2K25 on PS5, which originally launched just under a year ago.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA Tour 2K25 - Launch Trailer I PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56kdTsvVzYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We gave the game a respectable<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/pga-tour-2k25-review/"> 8/10 in our review.</a> “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet,” said Nick. “There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

<p>The next title is rather older, Monster Hunter Rise launched on Switch March 2021 with the PS5 version launching in 2023. Both the PS4 and PS5 version will be available.</p>

<p>“Monster Hunter Rise is an incredible game,” gushed Dominic in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/"> 9/10 review of the Switch version</a>. “While it may not feel quite as ground-breaking for the series as World did, it boasts a stronger and distinctly Japanese identity, and the changes and streamlined gameplay simply focus on the franchise’s true stars – the monsters. Rise is easily one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch, and one of the finest Monster Hunters ever.” He also gave the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review-xbox-series-x/">PS5 version 9/10 as well</a>.</p>
<p>If you have never played the game, fret not, we have a bunch of guides for you.</p>

<p>Golf, monster hunting, what else do you want? How about some RPG action with The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road, which include access to all major Chapter zones, biomes and quest arcs released until the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Rounding things off the rather cute Slime Rancher 2, which sadly only <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/slime-rancher-2-review/">scored 6/10 in our review.&nbsp;</a></p>
