		<p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil Showcase for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming this week, airing on Thursday 15th January at 10PM GMT. For those of you outside the meanest of timezones, that’s 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 11PM CET, 7AM JST (16th Jan).</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase tamely promises “<span dir="auto">brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem”, which definitely sounds plausible to me, but what new details are there to know? And how delicately will Capcom have to avoid getting too spoilery?</span></p>
<p>We already know a decent amount about the game. This ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft who is sent out into the field to investigate murders at a spooky hotel… which also happens to be where her mum was murdered.</p>
<p>Back at the game’s announcement, Capcom talked up having a new character who wasn’t so well versed in handling the horrors unleashed into the world. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/">As Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>But then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">they’ve made Leon a playable character anyway</a>! What this means practically is that Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, and Leon gets to do all the fun gun-slinging action stuff.</p>
<p>There’s also rumours of another returning character as well, and Capcom do have a tendency to throw in a random multiplayer game mode with their Resi games. I guess we’ll see if those appear in this showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.</p>
