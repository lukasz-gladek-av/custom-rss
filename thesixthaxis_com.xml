		<p>After the strong pushback to changes to the length of Conquest matches in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, Battlefield Studios has reversed those changes, and also adjusted the XP and progression in some really positive ways. Chalk this one up as a win for the good guys!</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios pushed live a change to Conquest matches that reduced the ticket count by up to 30%, in an effort to make matches shorter and always completed. This got reams and reams of complaints from the vocal parts of the community, such that they hastily reverted the change, restoring all maps back to 1,000 tickets and 45-minute round timers.</p>


<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o8wtub/bfcomms_conquest_update_ticket_counts_restored/">They seem a bit miffed about this though</a>, as they say “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this change may lead to longer match durations.”</p>
<p>Yeah…. we know. That’s exactly what people said they wanted!</p>
<p>The community had also said that they wanted some faster progression, with certain key milestones set for after level 20, locking away some of the longer class-based challenges away until you’ve already spent a dozen hours in the multiplayer. This brings assignments from when your Career Rank is in the 20s down to the 10s, so you can make a faster start on them, and general XP has been boosted by 10% for match completion and 40% for Daily Challenges.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o91xk4/bfcomms_battlefield_6_progression_changes_now_live/">The changes are as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Match Completion XP per min increased by 10%</li>
<li>XP from Daily Challenges increased by 40%</li>
<li>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 Attachment Ranks has been reduced.
<ul>
<li>Please Note: For weapons that are already being progressed, the UI might display something inaccurate at first; this will resolve once a match has been played with that weapon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignments requiring Career Ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require Career Ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team also notes that some of the challenges themselves have come in for criticism, putting a high bar on specific types of actions, like healing teammates within contested capture points, getting suppressing fire (which is more of a byproduct of missing your target), kills while using the Assault class adrenaline shot, or just needing to get some a really high volume of various things. They can be a bit of a chore, let’s say.</p>
<p>“As stated within the Community Update, we are aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves. We are actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes.”</p>
<p>Two big and positive changes, then. Hopefully the group keep it up!</p>
