		<p>It’s taken a lot to get here, but deep at the bottom of the Great Mines in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Metroid-Prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, Samus faces the greatest challenge yet on the planet Viewros. You know it’s going to be a rough time when you’re fighting something Omega in a Metroid game…</p>
<p>Now, obviously, <strong>this guide contains spoilers </strong>for Metroid Prime 4, so <strong>stop reading at this point if you are not currently at the final battle of the Great Mines</strong> in the game.</p>
<p>OK… so everyone that’s still here would like some helpful hints? Let’s go.</p>


<h2>Great Mines Omega Boss – First Phase</h2>
<h3>Wall Crawler</h3>
<p>The Omega boss in the Great Mines is a pretty challenging one to tackle, and it fights you in two modes, moves quickly and has long periods of invulnerability.</p>
<p>To start, the Omega Griever scurries around from side to side, high up on the walls of the battle arena. From there, t regularly stops and fires a series of green globs of gloop that slow you and deal damage over time if they hit. Look out for it winding up to start spitting and try to dodge and jump to the sides to evade.</p>


<p>While in this mode, the Omega Griever is hiding its weak spot on the chest and won’t take any damage, but it can be staggered. You need to aim to hit the fleshy coloured parts of its body, as opposed to the black armoured or green glowing sections –&nbsp;you’ll know you’re hitting when it glows gold. Just rapid fire the beam cannon during this and try to lead the target as it moves. The difficulty is that the Omega Griever can dash and break your lock-on, so be ready to quickly release and retarget.</p>
<p>Once enough hits have landed, the Omega Griever will be fatigued and drop to reveal the red weak spot on its chest. Hit this with as much damage as possible –&nbsp;a Super Missile does the trick! –&nbsp;and it will drop to the floor.</p>

<h3>Floor Battle</h3>
<p>Now that the Griever is on the floor, it gets more inventive with its attacks. Here’s what you need to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Sticky Green Gloop</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever projectile vomits green gloop in a cone to its front. This will slow and damage Samus, and you need to mash A to free yourself.<br>
<strong>Claw Attack</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever gets close and swipes with its big arms in turn. Try to keep your distance and jump or dodge away.<br>
<strong>Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever slams on the floor, creating a shockwave that you can avoid by jumping over the top.<br>
<strong>Tongue Grab</strong> –&nbsp;Whipping out its long tentacle-like tongue, the Griever tries to grab Samus and draw her in. Deal as much damage to the tongue as possible while grabbed to get free.</p>

<p>During this phase you need to keep blasting, aiming for exposed fleshy limbs to stun the Omega Griever. Once stunned it slumps to the ground, but its weak spot is still covered. Change to the morph ball, roll under and lay some bombs quickly. This now puts the Omega Griever into a proper damage phase, leaning back to expose its chest.</p>

<p>Unload everything you have with super missiles and charged beam shots, but beware that it can unleash a gloop attack and escape once the stunlock is up.</p>

<h2>Omega Griever – Second Phase</h2>
<p>After taking around one third damage, the Omega Griever will try to escape and crash through a part of the wall, creating some ammo and health that you can absorb with while charging up a beam shot. It also causes some basic and explosive Grievers to spawn. Take them out quickly and it will start to crawl around the walls once more.</p>

<p>It moves a bit quicker now, and has more crusted black armour that is truly invulnerable, but it’s the same process of hitting the fleshy bits to stun, and then the weak spot to drop the Omega Griever to the floor.</p>
<p>Once on the floor, prepare yourself for variants of the same attacks and one new one:</p>
<p><strong>Big Green Ball</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever rolls up and throws a big green ball at Samus. Keep moving to avoid.<br>
Leaping Claw Attack –&nbsp;Now there are up to three swipes and the Griever will leap forward to try and hit Samus.<br>
<strong>Double Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;It now hits the ground in quick succession. Just time a late double jump<br>
Sticky Green Gloop &amp; Tongue Grab are the same.</p>

<p>Again, keep hitting exposed flesh, morph ball and bomb its chest when stunned, and Super Missile the chest when you can.</p>
<h2>Omega Griever Third Phase</h2>
<p>Once down to its final third of health, the Omega Griever again escapes and smashes into the wall, summons lesser Grievers and grows more armour. It might be faster now, but follow the same methods as before to get it down to the ground.</p>
<p>Once on the ground be aware of new and modified attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Laser Beam</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever does a full 360º&nbsp;laser beam attack that you need to jump over to avoid. This does also leave a temporary gas cloud at the edge of the arena, so don’t get too far away.<br>
<strong>Quad Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;Two double ground pounds from its lower and upper arms. Time your double jumps to avoid.<br>
Quad Claw Attack –&nbsp;It’s just four back-to-back claw attacks. Keep your distance.</p>

<p>Keep hitting exposed flesh, and get to that weak point!</p>
<h2><strong>Omega Griever Trick Phase!</strong></h2>
<p>Eventually the Omega Griever falls, flopping to the ground and dropping a power up… but wait! It’s a trap!</p>

<p>The Omega Griever grabs you when you get close and starts sapping your life. Shoot it a ton in the face to be released and go for one last ground fight phase. You know what to do and everything it can do by now. Finish the fight!</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve just earned the final major upgrade in the game, and are into the final stretch. You now need to head back out, but there’s one last thing you should do in the Great Mines before leaving: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/">look for the Scout Bot</a>.</p>
