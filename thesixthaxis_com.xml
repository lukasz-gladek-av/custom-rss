<p>Kirby Air Riders is a sequel to the pink puff ball’s 2003 GameCube original, Kirby Air Ride. The game features a roster of 16 characters drawn from the Kirby universe, with a mixture of both racing and the returning City Trial mode, which is much more like a vehicular combat game, where you rampage around the Skyah city map, powering up your Air Machines in preparation for game-ending minigames.</p>

<p>It’s curious mix, and in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands on with the title back at Gamescom 2025</a>, I said, “Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-will-launch-on-november-20th/">Kirby Air Riders is launching for Nintendo Switch 2 on 20th November</a>.</p>
