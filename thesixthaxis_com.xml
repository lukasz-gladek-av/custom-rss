		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> is coming in December, with the addition of a huge new island to the game. Pocketpair has also revealed a crossover collaboration with Terraria for their monster catching survival game that will arrive in 2025.</p>
<p>There’s few details to go on at this point, but the new island will be about six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in the last major update in June. This new locale will bring “Powerful tower bosses and many vicious new species of Pals lurk here.”</p>


<p>They also promise, “A large amount of new content will also be added.”</p>

		
		

<p>Palworld launched into early access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the start of this year – the console exclusivity going hand in hand with being day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> – before spreading its cute monster-y wings onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation</a> in September. The game really took the world by storm, with the “meme game” concept of being Pokémon with guns grabbing people’s attention, but then also appealing to core gamers by leaning into other popular genres like survival and base building.</p>
<p>That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

<p>We’ll just have to wait and see, but even with the spectre of legal trouble in the background, it’s good to see that Pocketpair is forging ahead with big updates such as this.</p>
<p>We expect to see more news in due course, with The Game Awards a likely avenue for some kind of reveal or announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/what-we-played-death-stranding-30-birds-towers-of-aghasba/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one of those weeks where I ignored the games I’ve been playing for a while (sorry Metaphor: ReFantazio) and started something completely different, setting out for a walk with Sam in Death Stranding. I have to say that the opening must be amongst the most cinematic game experiences I think I’ve ever had, and I absolutely love the world and the weirdness. I’m on a massive sci-fi kick at the moment too – you should all be watching Silo Season 2 on Apple TV+ – so it’s just the perfect game to match up with that.</p>

<p>In a surprise to no-one <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 as his one chill out game, but <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/30-birds-review/">30 Birds for review</a> and it is apparently very good! He’s also started Loco Motive for review. Finally, he’s revisiting an old favourite and started replaying The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played plenty more Phasmophobia, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, which is another VR game with telekinetic powers and guns, saying, “It’s great! (And on PS+ Premium game catalogue).”</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/">Towers of Aghasba</a> which offers some intriguing twists on the survival sandbox genre. He told us, “There’s still a lot of resource gathering, crafting, and base building, but also some cool features like nurturing emergent ecosystems and a more narrative-driven focus. It’s still in early access and I’m hoping the introduction of multiplayer will help dial up the fun factor.</p>
<p>“I’ve also been playing Assassin’s Creed Mirage which I really struggled with at first due to the rather basic combat and filler missions. Although I enjoy Basim as a protagonist, there’s only so many times Ubisoft can repeat the same assassin origin story – that said, roaming the streets of Baghdad and moving away from the RPG-ness of more recent AC games has provided a fun romp that also eschews any effort to pursue AC’s present-day storyline.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> has been getting real “Remember when Freddos were 10p?” Vibes from the Steam sale, saying. “20% off doesn’t feel like 20% off when the end result is still £40.” So he’s not actually bought anything new, but has got some bits of back catalogue in his basket. His gaming this week has been fits and starts of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, as he still hasn’t quite figured out which of the many Warhammer 40,000 games is the new one that everyone loved back in September. That and some GT7 on PS5 Pro with its shiny new ray traced reflections.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also perused the Steam sales, picking up UFO50 as an early Christmas present but just some super cheap horror stuff alongside that. Giving his new Switch a workout, Ade has been playing Bayonetta 3 and absolutely loving it. He says, “It’s a totally bonkers but totally brilliant game. It’s reminded me how much I love Platinum Games – with Vanquish being my absolute favourite – I’ve got a hankering to give Astral Chain a play next!” You’re in for a treat if you do!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s launch server issues have been resolved, Asobo Studio has stated, with server capacity now increased to meet demand and reliability at over 99.999%. Patches are due next week on 2nd and 9th December aiming to make further client-side improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-27-update/">update to the community</a> follows on from launch woes that saw players shoved into unending queues and the servers unable to cope with demand. <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now/">Hotfix 1</a> was released last Friday on 22nd November to address key snags that people were facing, though there is one outstanding issue with outdated marketplace content from MSFS 2020 clashing with the new install of MSFS 2024 on PC.</p>


<p>As noted last week, “outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behavior.” The advice was basically to remove that content.</p>
<p>Along these lines, most MSFS 2020 content has now been ported across to MSFS 2024, though with community reports and analytics showing that some 3rd party add-ons are still problematic, Asobo is currently blocking all MSFS 2020 non-aircraft content from use with MSFS 2024.</p>
<p>The patch on 9th December will add a feature for users to disable and enable content themselves, and a safe boot option that can deactivate all 3rd party content at once if you’re struggling to launch the game.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16882910197148-Known-issues-for-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-2024">an FAQ for outstanding issues</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the circles you fly in, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has maybe flown under the radar – heh – compared to its predecessor. The 2020 game was a marvel of conception and execution, able to approximate the entire world for players to fly in, and then with Asobo releasing a long-running stream of content updates to add more human-created touches of reality. MSFS 2024 sounds like it would be more iterative – and purchased content does carry forward – but has made some major changes to allow you to land and hop out of your aircraft, to bring a more meaningful career mode to the game with new mission types, and more.</p>
