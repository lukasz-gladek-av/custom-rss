			<p>Thief is a series that I’ve always I loved as an idea, but lack the patience to play properly. They’re the kind of game where if you’re spotted by just one guard you are in a bit of trouble, and will likely be reloading a save if there are more than that. It’s the kind of hardcore stealth experience that encourages ghost runs whilst also hoovering up every last valuable you can find on the way. Thief VR isn’t that, really, but it is still pretty good. And it’s also incredibly immersive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvLlHUUmP9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thief VR casts you as the wanted thief Magpie, completing jobs for your handler Cassandra. The voice acting for all the main parts is great, particularly Cassandra and returning classic Thief protagonist Garret, who quickly becomes a magical voice in your head. The story isn’t going to be the biggest draw here – it’s a touch predictable and some of the dialogue is poor – but it does its job well enough, giving you a variety of things to steal and a vague reason for doing it.</p>


<p>What this game nails is how you move through its levels. You grab a window and slide it open, grab the ledge and climb through, crouch and then walk over to a chest and pull out your lockpicks. It might not sound like much, but this sequence of actions can vary wildly between VR games. Thief VR just manages to make all of this feel slick and intuitive. The locomotion here is unobtrusive enough that just climbing through a window, peaking through a door, listening to a nearby pair of guards chatting feels incredibly immersive and natural.</p>


<p>The levels looks pretty good as well. They’re not the best visuals I’ve seen in VR, but certainly aren’t the worst either. I occasionally stopped to have a look at some of the views, which is a good sign. You will find some poor textures, especially if you stop and look at the foliage as I did exactly once, and the characters all look a bit odd. Even a main character like Cassandra feels a bit like a waxwork model come to life, though she specifically fares a little better than some characters in other games I could mention. Whilst it won’t blow your mind by any stretch of the imagination, the game looks good enough to be immersive.</p>
<p>But then there are the immersion breakers, and they’re everywhere. Locomotion is great, but opening drawers is a nightmare. Grabbing a drawer, you open it towards you, let go and… it slams shut again because your hand, which you didn’t move, caught it slightly. You open it again and the loot inside is jittering about and jerking side to side slightly. You collect the loot and try to close the drawer, but it bounces open again despite you being incredibly careful. In the worst case scenario, the loot is clipping through the bottom of the drawer, causing the drawer to either be stuck frozen in space or randomly opening and closing slightly, whilst also stopping you from collecting the loot because it’s stuck inside the wood. Each drawer is usually part of a cabinet that has one to three more drawers on it. It’s difficult to feel like a thief when it looks a lot like you’ve never encountered drawers before and are acting like my nan trying to work a computer.</p>

<p>This situation is a microcosm of Thief VR where smaller details break through the great work done elsewhere. Climbing up walls, you can actually grab empty space next to a handhold to keep climbing. If you use a horizontal rope to make your way over a gap, the angles that your in-game wrists stick out at are ridiculous. Sneak up behind a guard, bonk him on the head with your truncheon and he stops to draw his sword before falling to his knees. For everything Thief VR does right there is something else that dims your lantern of enjoyment, leaving you in moodily lit awkwardness.</p>
<p>If you can ignore the constant immersion breakers there is a pretty good thief game here, but that’s home brand thief, not Thief the series. The light gem on your hand is binary now, visible or practically invisible, where being lit just means “You are standing in the light, fool!”, which makes getting close to enemies without being spotted rather easy. You quickly get a bow with all the requisite arrows – water, fire, bludgeoning, rope, and those boring pointy ones that don’t do anything special – and your trusty truncheon hangs from your hip so you can sneak up on a guard and bonk them on the head once or twice, depending on whether they’re wearing a helmet.</p>

<p>The guard AI is, frankly, abysmal when it’s working, and then sometimes just breaks. A guard walked within a few feet of me while I was knocking out another guard and didn’t notice, but then another guard heard me doing the same one room over.&nbsp;You can hit guards in the legs to bring them down to their knees – handy to knock them out whilst crouching – but sometimes it doesn’t work and they still get their swords out before falling. You can turn the difficulty up, removing assists, but the AI is so poor it still isn’t the challenge it should be. Sometimes, when a guard spots you, he freezes in place, not approaching, attacking, or even speaking.</p>
<p>Upgrading your skills and gear doesn’t rely on the money you earn from stealing, but rather on rewards from Cassandra for stealing a certain amount and snagging a relic. These are upgrades like moving quicker whilst crouched (which is absolutely essential, obviously), making less noise when sprinting or landing, or starting a mission with two water arrows. That’s a big one, since you can’t buy more water arrows and have to instead find them lying around in levels, which is just three layers of silliness.</p>
<p>All that said, I have found that stealth in VR has made me far more patient than in non-VR games because I’m so much more immersed. I’m not staring at a screen waiting, I’m pressed up against the actual wall myself. The moments where you encounter a tolerable amount of quirks, meticulously sneak into a building, steal your prize, and get away without a sound are still very enjoyable. There are one or two good moments in the story as well, even if it isn’t overly impressive overall – I particularly enjoyed losing my equipment and having to reclaim it whilst escaping from a prison, which is an overused trope, but made it marginally more challenging and enjoyable.</p>

		<p>Christmas is that wonderful time of year where everyone waits for a man covered in a bed sheet to come down their chimney and put some presents by the carved pumpkins, and 3D bullet heaven <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a> is getting right into the spirit of things with a new Spooky Update that’s out now!</p>
<p>Well, OK, so this was actually intended to be a more timely Halloween update developer vedinad says, “but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than i initially planned. anyway hope you like it!”</p>


<p>So that means there’s a new map, new character, new weapon, items, enemies and bosses and all of that on top of the bug fixes and new settings. Seems a pretty hefty update, which does actually tie in with the Christmas gift-giving spirit this time of year. Nice!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Megabonk Spooky Update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map<wbr></li>
<li>New Character<wbr></li>
<li>New Weapon<wbr></li>
<li>New Items<wbr></li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses<wbr></li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game<wbr></p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork’s Megacrit didn’t work<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a “bug” where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.<wbr><wbr></li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings – Will enable certain settings that most players don’t need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.<wbr></li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won’t be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the “caveman” bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn’t be able to spawn close to you or reach you<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won’t be OP<wbr></li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile<wbr></li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.<wbr></li>
<li>Calcium’s passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%<wbr></li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It’s to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you’re veeeryy late game.<wbr></li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16<wbr></li>
<li>Dragon’s Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4<wbr></li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn’t make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet<wbr></li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>You can press F10 to open the console<wbr></li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something<wbr></li>
<li>Type “help” in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Edifier Hecate G2000 Pro Gaming Speaker Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/edifier-hecate-g2000-pro-gaming-speaker-review/</link>
            <guid>1383223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As you set up your brand-new glowing, pulsating RGB-heavy PC, you’ll likely realise there’s something missing: RGB-heavy speakers to light up your ears with sound! While I’m not sure of the medical or auditory accuracy of that, Edifier seem committed to the cause, with the new version of the Hecate G2000 Pro their latest stereo speaker kit, decked out with some extremely bright neon lights. If you’re into RGB, they might just be the perfect addition to your setup.</p>

<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro are, in line with the brand’s visual design language, shaped as a stretched-out hexagon, with our review unit coming with white speaker facades. Central to each of these is the speaker driver, its black surface contrasted by a silver centre emblazoned with the Hecate logo. The rear of each speaker unit is made from clear plastic, exposing the white and silver housing within, and they look smart and futuristic. They are definitely aimed at gamers though, and where you could easily see the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/edifier-qr65-desktop-active-monitor-review/">Edifier QR65</a> in a variety of different houses, these feel targeted at someone who wants a particularly flashy gaming setup.</p>


<p>There’s a range of support for different platforms, with the G2000 Pro certified for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S via USB-A, alongside Bluetooth connections, and you can also pump audio in via a 3.5mm connection, all of which means you can use them with pretty much any audio device out there. In the box, you’ll find the Hecate G2000 Pro, a power adaptor, as well as a USB-A cable and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable in the box too, so you won’t be searching around for things to complete your setup.</p>
<p>The right-hand speaker features a control panel across the top edge, with four buttons giving you access to input selection, Bluetooth pairing, volume, EQ and lighting controls. This is, as with some of their previous speakers, the weakest element, as the input selection simply works its way through a series of clicks, rather than voicing what input they’re connected to, and at various points through our testing I became very confused about why I didn’t have any output from my PC, only to find that the input had changed.</p>


<p>The G button runs you through the different EQ settings, with each represented amusingly by audio prompts, so a short musical trill means you’re in music mode, what sounds like a chugging engine is aimed at movies (I think it’s supposed to be a cinema reel turning), and a click and clunk of a gun reloading is for gaming. This all takes a little unnecessary parsing out, and I can’t help but think things would have been a lot clearer with a simple spoken instruction.</p>
<p>Once you’re in the correct mode though, the next thing to consider is lighting. You can turn this off and on via the G button, and alter the brightness and setup via the control buttons, but for the sake of ease you’ll need to download the Hecate Gaming App. As apps go, this has to be amongst the most basic I’ve seen in recent years, and it’s disappointing to find that you can only choose between six colours, or a rainbow effect that scrolls through them. If you have an orange light setup – which is what I have – you can forget matching the Hecate G2000 Pro to it, which seems very very odd.</p>
<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro redeem themselves somewhat by sounding much better than their app would suggest. There’s a heap of power here, and a pleasingly airy soundstage that adds depth and space to whatever you’re pumping through them. I’ve been checking out President’s King of Terrors EP – that’s definitely Charlie Simpson isn’t it? – and the mix of electronic and rock instrumentation sounded fantastic via the Music EQ setting, with plenty of detail and well controlled bass tones. If you don’t like how this EQ sounds, there’s no option of tweaking or changing it, so you’ll have to search out other EQ options, the availability of which will depend greatly on what platform you’ve got them attached to.</p>

<p>Shifting over to gaming, I put the bespoke EQ through its paces with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and its suitably epic Japanese-infused soundtrack, and the G2000 Pro definitely helped to immerse me even further into Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures. Dialogue was clear and carried well above the delicate audio, while the interstitial sound effects helped to round out the world further.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio sounded solid, though the Hecate G2000 Pro is only capable of dealing with the standard SBC codec, so you’re not getting lossless playback or even AAC, and there was a difference in clarity between the USB connection from my PC and the lossy Bluetooth one. That’s not surprising, but I was disappointed to find there was no higher quality codec support when Edifier have put a lot of emphasis on this with their other recent products.</p>
