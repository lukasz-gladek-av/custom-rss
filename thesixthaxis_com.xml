		<p>Kojima Productions has released a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox title OD, with the new teaser called OD Knock which is really rather creepy. Much of it is seen from a first person perspective, with the character walking into a room and lighting candles. It sounds fine but there is one candle in the shape of a baby and when it is lit you hear a baby cry. Another candle in the shape of a head bleeds when lit, plus there is the picture of the eye on the window that is watching everything unfold. Thatâ€™s all before whatever is knocking on the door enters the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="OD - KNOCK Teaser Trailer - [ESRB] 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer does not give much away about what OD is, except it looks like it will be some kind of psychological horror with occult vibes. What we know is that it is being touted as &nbsp;a game, a movie and something completely new as well. it uses Unreal Engine, 3Lateral and Metahuman technology. Jordan Peele, the director of movies like Nope and Get Out, is collaborating with Kojima Productions so there will be some creepiness and messages within the story. OD will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.</p>
<p>There is no release date yet for OD, but the game is now in full production following the release of Death Stranding 2. OD is an Xbox exclusive.</p>
