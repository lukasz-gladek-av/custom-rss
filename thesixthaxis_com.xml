<p>Over the Hill is a game about offroading in which players drive vehicles from the 60s to 80s either alone or in a group, while dealing with the challenges that come with navigating some tough trails. It is not just the landscape that will provide a challenge, with Over the Hill featuring dynamic weather and a day/night cycle. The different areas are inspired by real world locations, each filled with different objectives. Completing these objectives will unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customisations, and cosmetics. And, you can capture the scenery through a photo mode.</p>
<p>A date for the full release of Over the Hill is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost have announced that the open world RPG Of Ash and Steel will be launching on November 6th for PC, and a demo has been released for Steam Next Fest. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo for Of Ash and Steel will feature an area of the game that can be explored including an abandoned village, of which you can try and solve the mystery of what happened. There will be a part of the main quest available to play along with side missions, and players will also be able to delve into the skill trees, various professions, and the upgrades. Players can experiment with different combat styles from being light footed to wearing a full suit of armour while wielding a giant weapon. In addition to the campaign, there is also an Arena mode where players can earn gear, gold, and XP. There are also ranks to climb to defeat more powerful enemies, and become the champion of the arena.</p>
