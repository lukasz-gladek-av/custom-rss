		<p>Jade Raymond has departed Sony’s Haven Studios, the developer that she founded in 2021, with the development of their first title, Fairgames (stylised as Fairgame$) yet to be completed for PlayStation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">reporting by Bloomberg</a> digs into the situation surrounding her departure, stating that PlayStation leadership did not give Haven’s staff a reason for her departure, but that it came several weeks after an external test of Fairgames – according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apparently, the team at Haven are a bit concerned about how the game was received and its general progress.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed Raymond’s departure. “Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”</p>
<p>However, they are “committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey” and the studio will now have a pair of co-studio heads in the form of Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski.</p>

<p>Announced in 2023 and in development for PlayStation and PC, Fairgames is one of the many live service titles that PlayStation greenlit at the tail end of Jim Ryan’s tenure. We haven’t seen or heard anything about the game since it was revealed, arriving with a slick cinematic trailer that showed a multiplayer heist ’em up with PvPvE elements. In other words, it’s an extraction shooter, a high tech modern take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/12/hood-outlaws-and-legends-review/">Hood: Outlaws and Legends.</a></p>

<p>Jade Raymond is one of the best-known known individuals in the games industry, though mainly for the string of new studios that she has founded and ventures that she has led over the past decade. Having been a producer and then executive producer through the early years of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, she went on to work on the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/06/03/watch-dogs-review/">Watch Dogs</a> before moving on from Ubisoft. In 2015 she founded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/07/13/jade-raymond-founds-eas-new-motive-studios/">Motive Studios at EA</a>, intent on making Star Wars games in partnership with Visceral Games and Amy Hennig. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/ea-shut-down-visceral-games-moves-its-star-wars-game-to-another-studio/">We all know how that turned out</a>, but Motive did craft the single player for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> during her tenure and has become a core part of EA’s line up of studios.</p>
<p>Following Battlefront II’s release, Raymond left to join Google as head of Stadia Games and Entertainment… and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/29/google-stadia-shut-down-january-2023/">we know how that turned out</a>. Then, with fresh funding and backing from Sony’s push to make live service games, she founded Haven Studios, and got to work on Fairgames. While we don’t know Farigames’ fate, we do know how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">Sony’s live service plan has been turning out</a>…</p>

		<p>Nintendo has detailed the free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> game updates that will be coming to a bunch of their first party games alongside the console’s release on 5th June 2025. Across 11 games (12 on a technicality), there’s a range of different Switch 2 specific improvements, including higher resolutions, better frame rates, HDR support and, for multiplayer titles, the addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the premium Switch 2 Edition game upgrade, which start at £8 / $10 and can bring a big batch of added content and features, these are less significant patches that are being sent out for free.&nbsp;That these games were getting free updates was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">already known</a>, but this now confirms what exactly each game is getting.</p>


<p>Included in the list are games that have some notorious performance issues, like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, or could simply do with having some kinks smoothed out, like the hitching of the Link’s Awakening remake. What’s surprising, when factoring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">paid Switch 2 Editions for Breath of the Wild and Metroid Prime 4</a>, is that some games here are getting HDR support for free, and there’s even Game Builder Garage getting mouse mode support.</p>
