		<p>It’s been another great week of gaming at TSA Towers, and for me, that’s meant more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. I’m taking my time rounding out my endgame loadout, as I don’t want to burn through literally everything before Title Update 1 drops with new enemies and quests. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, enjoying how different it is to my normal fantasy/sci-fi selections. I’m also hopping into Mecha Break, and Titan Quest II, while rounding out a retro-infused review of the Retroid Pocket 5.</p>

<p>First up, as is tradition, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Similarly, <strong>Aran</strong> has been in <em>his</em> gaming happy place by playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt again. He tolds us, “I’ve got the DLC left to do and the final parts of the main quest. All treasure hunts have been completed, all base game contracts fulfilled, and side quests done. Unlike my first playthrough, I have not subjected myself to uncovering all the question marks.”</p>
<p>It’s not all been a Geralt love in though, as he continues, “I’ve also started a new Football Manager 2024 save and a random team picker has pointed me in the direction of FC Brea. They play in the 5th tier of Spanish football, have a 900 capacity stadium, and have no transfer budget. My challenge is to make them a titan unless I get fired. Doesn’t help the board want me to just avoid relegation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been glued to Mafia III this week and hopes to put a bow on it before the end of the month. He says, “As a sucker for third person cover-based shooters, it’s been a while since I’ve seen those mechanics in a modern AAA game and while Mafia III isn’t quite as fun or fluid as the GOAT, Uncharted 4, it’s got some seriously sharp writing and great set pieces.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been in the hospital this week – get well soon buddy! – which he pegs as, “playing real-life Theme Hospital”. He’s hoping to be well enough for some relaxing gaming, which will probably be Nintendo-flavoured.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing some Assassin’s Creed Shadows as part of our upcoming coverage, as well as Phasmophobia and Balatro.This has been mirrored by Ade who’s game-time has been pretty much non-stop 24-7 all encompassing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows to be review ready for next week. Are you excited?</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is on his travels in Kanazawa, playing the game of parenting on holiday. He says, “I did see an awesome, original PS1 box in the lobby of this hotel when I checked in last night. Was very impressed. Will take a pic on the way out the door today so everyone can partake in the natsukashii!”</p>
<p>And rounding out the week,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has just got code for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/expelled-is-a-murderous-sequel-to-overboard-coming-out-in-march/">Expelled!</a> the boarding school sequel to Overboard! and he’s looking forward to checking it out over the weekend. Aside from that, he got an early look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">its new 6v6 game mode</a>, and took a trip to see Steel Hunters, the upcoming mech multiplayer game from Wargaming.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played?</p>
