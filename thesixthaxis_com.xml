		<p>As the walls of console exclusivity are torn down for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, and Square Enix prepares to release this sumptuous JRPG reimagining on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-will-launch-january-22nd-for-switch-2-and-xbox/">22nd January</a>, they’ve now given everyone the chance to preview the game on their non-PlayStation consoles with a demo.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - One-Winged Angel Trailer | NSW2 &amp; XBOX" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AF1s32fc5NQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The content here will likely be quite familiar, as the demo features the first chapter of the game, the Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission. Playing the demo will create save data that can carry through to the main game, and will also reward you with&nbsp;bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set”.</p>
<p>For Xbox gamers, head to the Xbox store on console, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo/9NFTWDJKGSBF">or here in a browser</a> to download the FF7 Remake Intergrade demo.</p>
<p>To check out the demo on Nintendo Switch, you can find it on the eShop on console and in browser – <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html">see here for the UK store page.</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, Square Enix has created two regional blanket use codes that you can redeem at the Nintendo redemption page here: https://ec.nintendo.com/redeem/</p>

</ul>
<p>Not sure why they did that, but nice.</p>
<p>Either way, this gives players a great chance to see how the game holds up on Switch 2 – Series X will obviously be very similar to PS5 and Series S cut down from that, but Switch 2 being lower power and handheld asks for more compromises. As the Intergrade release, this includes both the 2020 original release, and the Intergrade side story that released and enhanced the game for PS5.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Review</a>, Tuffcub said, <em>“An utter joy to play from start to finish, packed with memorable scenes, moustache-twirling baddies, and epic battles. The first part of Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t just polished, it’s opulent.”</em></p>
<p>While in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/17/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-review-ps5/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review,&nbsp;</a>Nic said, <em>“You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted. However, the DLC isn’t quite perfect and, despite the filler, it feels very short for its price, especially if you’re not interested in the side missions.”</em></p>
