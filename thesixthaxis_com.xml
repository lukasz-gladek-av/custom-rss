		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has announced that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> demo will be available to download on November 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>The free demo will give players their first taste of the reimagined hack and slash series as they take on the role of nameless warrior whose fate in entwined with that of ancient China’s warring Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set during a campaign against the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, players will find themselves thrust into the Battle of Sishui Gate. For those who have been following Dynasty Warriors: Origins since its announcement, this is the same stage that has been shown off during various expos, showcasing many of the game fresh new features as well as some of its most beloved characters. Speaking of which, the Battle of Sishui Gate is where the allied Three Kingdoms first face off against the legendary warrior, Lu Bu, a fight that’s bound to put players through their paces once the training wheels come off.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will officially launch next year on January 17th, making it one of 2025’s first major releases with pre-orders now live across all available platforms. It’s a soft reset for the series, and while it doesn’t look to be a complete departure from previous games there are some interesting mechanics at play that will hopefully dispel the bad taste left by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-9">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>.</p>

<p>It has been the best part of a decade since the last numbered instalment which scored a mediocre 5/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 review</a>. We concluded that” Sadly, this isn’t the breakthrough fans were expecting. Omega Force took a pretty big risk with Dynasty Warriors 9, and while its open world integration can be seen as a small triumph, this newest entry is marred by its heavily outdated approach to combat design.”</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to attend a preview event for Origins and will have some first hands-on impressions coming very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/sony-announce-black-friday-playstation-deals-starting-friday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> 2024 sale will start on 22nd November and run until 2nd December, with the pretty familiar spread of offers across games, hardware and accessories, whether you’re buying direct from PlayStation or with participating retailers.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important part of this is the huge sale that will sweep onto the PlayStation Store for digital <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PS4 games. Sony highlight that this will include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>… and they’ll probably match the prices seen in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/xbox-black-friday-sale-cuts-50-off-xbox-series-xs-consoles-discounts-over-1000-games/">Xbox Black Friday sale</a> that’s already underway.</p>


<p>Second most important for existing PS5 gamers is the annual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> subscription discount. From 22nd November you’ll be able to save up to 30% across a 12-month membership. Existing subscribers can also save 25% when upgrading from Essential to Extra, or 30% when going from Extra to Premium/Deluxe – Premium members will now get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">cloud gaming for PS Portal</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re after some new hardware, then you can look to PlayStation Direct, or your chosen retailer for discounts across PS5 consoles, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR2</a>, games, and PS5 accessories including DualSense wireless controllers, Pulse Elite wireless headset, Pulse Explore wireless earbuds. They’re also launching a special PS5 Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle. These will take the form of an MSRP drop, but retailers are always able to compete and create their own bundles from it.</p>
<p>What will those discounts be? Sony ain’t saying just yet… but we do have the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-des-remises-interessantes-attendues-sur-les-consoles-ps5-chez-plusieurs-marchands-59662">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They claim that following PS5 and PSVR 2 discounts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Standard Edition</strong>: €474.99 instead of €549.99.</li>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Digital Edition</strong>: €374.99 instead of €449.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 headset</strong>: €399.99 instead of €599.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 <a title="Games > Horizon Call of the Mountain [30 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/horizon-call-of-the-mountain/">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> Pack:</strong> (contains the PS VR2 headset + Horizon Call of the Mountain game activation code): €399.99 instead of €649.99.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a huge up to €250 off a PSVR 2! And a more sensible €75 off on PS5 Slims.</p>
