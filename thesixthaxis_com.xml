		<p>There is no avoiding the (mechanical) elephant in the room so let’s get it out of the way: Boy oh boy does this game look and play like Sony’s Horizon franchise. A female protagonist with a bow and a big stick for finishers? Check. Set in the far future over multiple biomes including lush rainforests and deserts? Check. Giant mechanical beasts with weak points that glow, that look and even move the same as those in Horizon? Check. Even the music is similar.</p>
<p>There are natives, dressed exactly the same as those in Horizon, the protagonist has a glider exactly the same as Horizon, there’s red grass for stealth, the trailer has characters entering a cave and finding cave paintings a scene lifted from the original HZD Trailer. But hey, completing ripping off one franchise isn’t enough so why not take the Ghost from Destiny and add them in as well, including the exact same scanning animation. </p>

<p>While Horizon can’t lay claim to inventing mechanical beasties, Zoids were doing that back in the 80s, the art style is so similar you could honestly think some of of this trailer was from a Horizon game. </p>
<p>However, Light of Motiram is an open world survival game rather than an action adventure so there is base building, crafting and all that sort of thing. So that’s different and absolutely, totally not the sort of thing that would be in Sony’s upcoming Horizon online multiplayer title. </p>

<p>Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam </a>and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first. </p>
