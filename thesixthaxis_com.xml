		<p>The closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bluepoint-games/">Bluepoint Games</a> has once again raised the question of why they were never tasked to remake Bloodborne for PS5. Fans wanted it, and it seems a perfect fit for the studio, so why did it not happen?</p>
<p>Over on Bloomberg, Jason Schreier has said that Bluepoint did indeed pitch to remake Bloodborne in 2025 and “the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">interview</a> last year, former PlayStation Boss Shuhei Yoshida seemingly backed this up, saying FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki did want more from the Bloodborne world, perhaps including a remake, but he is far too busy and &nbsp;“doesn’t want anyone else to touch it.”</p>


<p>Sony do not need FromSoftware’s permission, they own Bloodborne, but Sony would rather keep FromSoftware happy rather than go ahead with any remake. FromSoftware had a massive hit with Elden Ring, and they are still open to exclusives as their next game, The Duskbloods, is only on Switch 2, so Sony keeping them onside with a view to a future exclusive makes sense.</p>


<p>Bloodborne is still selling well, with nearly 2 million units sold between February 2022 and November 2025, 10 years after it launched.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had previously been working on a live service game in the God of War universe in which Atreus would have found himself in the Underworld and battling to escape. That was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/"> cancelled in January 2025</a> along with the live service game that Sony Bend had been working on. Details of the Bend game have never been released.</p>
<p>Right now, you can play two of Sony live service games that managed to escape the axe, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Marathon">Marathon </a>and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>.&nbsp; They also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/jade-raymond-has-now-left-haven-studios-leaves-questions-over-playstation-live-service-fairgames/">Fairgame$</a> in development, an extraction shooter that sounds like it may compete with Marathon for players.</p>
