		<p>Monster Train 2 has been announced, a full-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite that is set to pull into the station later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC. But there’s even better news for fans of the original, because <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo is out today on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Train 2 looks to build on the original’s three-floor battle system while tasking you with stopping the hugely powerful Titans from destroying the world. That means that – gasp – Heaven and Hell will be forming an alliance? And journeying together to the homeworld of the Titans, the Abyss.</p>
<p>You’ll have new enemy factions to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types.&nbsp;Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SCUF Valor Pro Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/scuf-valor-pro-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/scuf-valor-pro-controller-review.1113258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/scuf-valor-pro-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When it comes to pro-styled controllers, the Xbox family currently sports an embarrassment of button-filled riches. From their Elite series offerings to top-tier competition from Nacon, Turtle Beach and PowerA, there’s never been a more competitive field. SCUF know a thing or two about competition though, and after years as a well-known figure in esports, they’re releasing one of their most mainstream, most competitively priced controllers, while losing none of their esports-bred edge. The result? The SCUF Valor Pro is one of the best wired controllers of this generation.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll experience is the feel of the Valor Pro in your hand. It immediately lends you a sense of quality and craftsmanship, with gorgeously firm and weighty tactility. Built from quality black and grey plastics, the soft-touch faceplate feels fantastic under your hand. There’s also comfortable rubberised texturing on the underside of each arm, helping to keep it firmly in place no matter how sweaty the situation might be.</p>



<p>The SCUF Valor Pro’s styling is understated but incredibly cool, with orange highlights around each of the analogue sticks, black camouflage patterning on the shoulder buttons and triggers, and subdued SCUF logos on the faceplate and the top of the controller. The faceplate is magnetic, letting you swap out the analogue stick tops, or customise the controller’s look, with alternate options available from SCUF, which is nice to see, even if it does come at additional cost.</p>
<p>Connectivity comes via the 10ft braided cable, leading from a USB-C socket on the top of the Valor Pro to a USB-A connector at the other end, ensuring that you can game while sat a sensible distance from your TV. While it’s branded for the Xbox family of consoles, it’s also fully compatible with PC, giving it some useful dual utility if you’re a multiplatform household.</p>

<p>The Valor Pro apes the asymmetrical layout of the official Xbox Series X|S pads, and when that’s one of the most comfortable controllers of all time, it makes sense to refine rather than reinvent. They’ve slightly reduced the controller’s size, making it easier to handle, and the resulting shift means that the rear paddles now sit directly beneath your fingers. There’s a host of improvements here that further lift it above its inspiration, not least the overall quality of the buttons and controls.</p>
<p>The Hall Effect analogue sticks feel excellent, both taut and precise, and the box includes a choice of concave and domed tops depending on your preference. I’ve never been particularly sold on domed tops, but it’s nice to have the option. They feel acutely tuned to FPS play, and through many days of Overwatch games they’ve shown their worth time and time again.</p>

<p>Hall Effect sticks are on course to be an industry standard now, but that’s in response to Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo’s own controllers not including the magnet-based technology. Where the official controllers can all eventually suffer from stick drift, Hall Effect sticks use magnetic field sensing instead of physical contacts that greatly extends the sticks potential lifespan. It’s impossible to say they’ll never wear out – no one can account for exactly how much Call of Duty you play – but they’ll definitely last a lot longer than the alternatives and drift shouldn’t be a factor.</p>
<p>Those FPS chops are furthered by the inclusion of my favourite trend in controllers – trigger lockouts. The Valor Pro’s versions take things one stop further though, completely altering the function of the trigger from analogue to digital micro switch. I’m not even sure how that’s possible, but in use, it means that your trigger response is as fast as a mouse click. It’ll be music to the ears of PC players who prefer to use a controller despite living in the world of keyboards and mice.</p>
<p>The central face buttons feel quick and solid, though it’s interesting that they’ve gone for membrane switches for the main ABXY buttons, but then the circular D-pad uses micro switches. This feels like the fastest D-pad I’ve ever come across, with that speed further helped by the wired connection. A future update on PC will mean the Valor Pro is rated for a 1000Hz polling rate which, for all you number fans, is very fast. Even without that, the Valor Pro feels super-fast and super-precise on both Xbox and PC. If you’re building on well-honed skills, the SCUF Valor Pro can take you to the next step.</p>

<p>There’s further controls to help you achieve greatness, with four additional paddles sitting beneath your fingertips on the underside of the controller. These are a great size, so you can’t miss them, but there’s a firmness to the P1 and P4 paddles to prevent you from accidentally activating them, which makes them feel strangely satisfying to use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the internal P2 and P3 buttons use micro switches, accelerating the Valor Pro’s responsiveness and making every millisecond count. If you’re not a paddle person, the central ones can be blanked out, with covers included in the box, while all of them can be deactivated to prevent any mishaps.</p>
<p>Two unusual additions are the control wheels to the left and right of the 3.5mm audio port. These give you incremental control over your in-game audio, affecting master volume and the game/chat mix. It’s a helpful inclusion, particularly if you’re using a wired headset like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro that has no onboard controls, and I really enjoyed having everything in one place.</p>
<p>At $109.99/£109.99 the Valor Pro offers a heap of features for less than half the price of some of its competitors. It seriously undercuts the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2 Pro</a>, my previous pick for a wired Xbox controller, and while it doesn’t have the modular layout functionality, the Valor Pro is far more natural to hold. If you’d rather go Wireless, I do like the Elite 2, with the Core version coming in at £114.99, but you have to pay extra for the paddles, and fundamentally they aren’t quite as comfortable to use as the Valor Pro’s offering.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roadcraft-preview-%E2%80%93-where-we%E2%80%99re-going-we-need-to-build-roads.1113255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>RoadCraft is the video game equivalent of playing in a sandbox with a bunch of bright yellow diggers and trucks. Sure, it’s got its roots in the often torturous terrain traversal of the MudRunner series, but once you get into the swing of the reconstruction tasks it sets you, it really starts to feel like you’re a big kid and your mates have come round to play.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no need to really engage your imagination here, conjuring up mental imagery of imagined disasters, or making mechanical or engine noises as you smash plastic into sand or dirt – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> has all these bases covered.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ldax1af5Wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played an opening scenario featured in the new Steam Next Fest demo – available for all from 24th February – dropping into a region that has been devastated by a tornado rolling through – how inconvenient! The power is out, the roads are flooded, and the terrain is only just the right side of a boggy swamp.</p>
<p>The first job is figuring out that you need to disengage the handbrake on your 4×4, and turn on AWD and split diff so that you can actually drive places without spinning your wheels deeper and deeper into the mud. Also, I inadvertently hooked my tow cable to a tyre and was dragging that around for five minutes before realising why I was randomly veering to the right –&nbsp;Look, it’s my first time actually playing these games, but I did eventually catch up to Dom, who knows his MudRunners like the back of his muddy hands.</p>

<p>Once we finally reached the first objective, picking our way through the woods and skirting flood waters, we got stuck in with the meaty terrain-altering vehicles that the game puts at your disposal. Swapping between vehicles from the world map is about as seamless as it gets, at which point you can dive straight into the task at hand –&nbsp;this first job being to clear an area of trees and stumps to make way for future work.</p>

<p>I forget their actual names, but for this one job we had to make use of Choppy the tree murderer, who can effortlessly cut a tree, spin it on its side and then “process” it into a single log, making way for Stumpy the tree stump muncher to come along and just mulch whatever was left sticking out of the ground. Finally, Grabby the… grabber lorry was on hand to come and pick up the logs and take them back to base on his trailer.</p>
<p>Stumpy was by far and away the most direct, with Choppy being similarly decent to get to grips with as you drive to the right position and then trigger his super effective tree murdering attack when the highlight turns green. Grabby, though…. let’s just say that Grabby actually needs you to be able to visualise the relative movement of his arm in 3D space, calculate some angular motion, and is prone to the waggly whims of a dangling mass of wood. It’s a real faff, in other words, but you do get used to it and shifting the camera to a top-down view helps a lot.</p>
<p>The second goal was where this all really started to shine. With a goal to power up and restore a concrete plant, we got to work figuring out the best route to take to this part of the map with our newly unlocked Kay Blur the cable layer –&nbsp;by this point we’d waved away a good chunk of the ‘fog of construction’ obscuring the landscape – and figuring out what we needed to use to get there. Again, there’s no simple road or clear path to take, and with the size of Kay and her laying apparatus, it quickly became clear that we’d need to take Choppy and Stumpy with us.</p>

<p>So began a half hour trek across the map, hopping back and forth between the vehicles and gradually clearing a path for Kay to take. I’ve said it already, but it really did bring to mind that kind of singular vision and clear focus of playing with construction toys to tackle some imagined goal. It was a lot of fun with two of us going at the task, and I can only imagine the kind of coordinated efforts that four could apply in co-op.</p>
<p>That mission complete, we came to the end of the demo on this map – the demo features three maps and scenarios – but this unlocked some further toys that you can play with. In particular, it opens up the possibility to actually start laying roads, using a dump truck to drop a steady bed of sand before laying tarmac and then flattening it out. There’s also a bridge that would been a concrete slab putting in place and more.</p>
<p>This really feels like the next logical step after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/02/spintires-mudrunner-review/">MudRunner</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/snowrunner-review/">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions</a>. You still have the foundational vehicular gameplay that proved to be a hit with so many players, and there’s some of the advancements from Expeditions, like having the terrain scanner to lean on. Applying this to a reconstruction scenario and with more deeply ingrained co-op feels like a perfect fit.</p>

<p>Really the only sticking point I can see for newcomers to the series is your mentality as a player, just as with the earlier games. There is that inherently torturous set of vehicle physics as you have to drag yourself through deep mud and water at points, which can be rather frustrating at times, and having to go back and get a slower vehicle for a job halfway across the map could easily be a 30 minute job with misadventures along the way. I’m sure this is as heretical to suggest as an easy mode for Dark Souls, but an option to lift away some of the drudgery with a quick-switching element as in The Crew 2 could just elevate that sandbox play. Of course, you don’t want to lose that inherent charm of playing and collaborating in co-op.</p>
<p>Coming out in May, the full game will feature eight large maps, over 40 vehicles, and a campaign that lets you build up your own building company to handle all manner of disasters around the world. For now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/">check out the demo on Steam</a> when it arrives next Monday.</p>

		<p>The Xenoblade franchise has weaved an unusual path through Nintendo’s recent history, each new entry in the series being both separate and at once part of the greater whole. While Switch fans have been treated to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Definitive version of the original game</a>, two <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">stellar</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/26/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review/">sequels</a>, and even <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/21/xenoblade-chronicles-2-torna-the-golden-country-review/">a whole game’s worth of DLC</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> has remained an oddity that, until now, remained cast out on the commercially unsuccessful Wii U.</p>
<p>However, the entire Xenoblade franchise will now be available in one place, with Xenoblade Chronicles X arriving as a swan song to the Nintendo Switch. That’s nice, because it’s one of the greatest RPG stories of our time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — The Year is 2054 — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ah9JgFGdqWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is, in itself, an atypical example of the franchise. While the rest of the series feel like a merging of fantasy and sci-fi, Chronicles X leans far more heavily on science fiction, creating a universe-spanning adventure that sees humanity stranded on an alien planet.</p>
<p>Earth was caught up in a battle between two titanic extraterrestrial foes, forcing the survivors to escape on giant colony ships, with alien foes destroying many of humanity’s last hopes. Your ship, the White Whale, made an initial escape, but was soon brought down to an alien world filled with danger. At the opening, you’re busted out of your escape pod by soldier Elma, and you make your way to the city while learning the ropes of the game’s combat and basic systems.</p>

<p>Anyone that’s played the original Xenoblade Chronicles will recognise the action palette running across the bottom of the screen. You can set up to eight different arts here for your character to utilise, many of which will have different effects and interplay between one another, helping you to cause massive damage if they’re used in the right order. It’s an MMO-influenced system that I’ve loved since the original game, and it still works fantastically here.</p>

<p>Set in our future, Xenoblade Chronicles X feels more grounded and realistic than the other Xenoblade titles. The lost colony and the city of New Los Angeles within it, showcase a community trying to hang onto the trappings of their home, despite having crash-landed in the midst of a hostile and utterly alien world.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition has taken a sensible approach to remastering, and right from the the outset, the performance is much better than it was on the Wii U. It’s not gone crazy with improvements to the visuals or changes to make the art direction more cohesive, though this is the sharpest and clearest the game has ever looked. The scale and design of the world remain the key highlights, and though the contrast between realism and fiction might surprise people who’ve only ever played the central trilogy, it’s nonetheless an attractive and engaging experience.</p>
<p>There’s a further contrast in the different musical styles that the soundtrack hops between, one moment rock, the next hip hop, before settling into the swells of a vocal orchestra. I’ve always loved the weird, almost irrational approach to audio in Xenoblade Chronicles X, and it has continued to delight, even if, at times, it feels as though it might have been slightly more of-the-moment than I realised.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X does make you wait for one of its best, and most integral features, the giant mech suits known as Skells. These huge units open the world up, being able to transform between their central robotic form and a super-fast wheeled vehicle, while giving you the firepower to get past Mira’s most powerful foes. It’s a treat you have to earn though, and you’ll be chomping at the bit to get your hands on one.</p>
<p>Thanks to its launch on the Wii U, and its change in outlook and direction from the original game, Xenoblade Chronicles X has always been the series’ outlier. However, it’s one of the most exciting and untamed RPG worlds, has a great story to tell, and fully deserves for its charms to be discovered by more players. Thankfully, that time is nearly here.</p>
