		<p>We’ve enjoyed plenty of lightning and thunder last night, with the promise of life being a bit cooler and a bit wetter in the UK for the coming week. With so much gaming tech and hardware in the house, I’ll admit I unplugged a few things just in case… but they’re getting full use again now that the risk of sudden and unwanted electricity has moved away.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li>The sun went away long enough for <strong>TSBonyman</strong> to play more Tainted Grail and to make a start on Dead Island 2, or more accurately, a re-start, picking up from his trial save file.</li>
<li>Dead Island 2 was also on <strong>Andrewww’s</strong> playlist, as he checked it out before it left PS Plus. He found it a little disappointing though, so moved along to The Stanley Parable, which he enjoyed somewhat, and watched his daughter playing Astro Bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>
