		<p>Valve has announced a new process for validating the age of users and comply with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/welcome-to-the-new-internet/">UK’s controversial Online Safety Act</a>. Thankfully, Valve’s path to confirm your age is much less intrusive than the one we’ve seen many social media companies and tech giants taking.</p>
<p>From now on, UK-based users looking to visit Steam store pages for mature rated games and their community hubs will require you to be logged into an active user account and opt-in for mature content. This does mean there’s no more blindly clicking through a quick date picker without logging in, which was useful for casually browsing.</p>


<p>Of course, this will now need a new process to verify a user’s age, and in the UK your age is considered verified so long as there is a valid credit or debit card stored on the account – while Valve stated “credit card”, banks issue different debit cards to customers who are above and below 18 years of age and perform age and identity checks for their accounts, so they should still provide the same age checks in this process.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to AI-based age guesstimation using phone cameras – some of which were initially fooled by the photo mode in Death Stranding – or demands for passport and drivers licenses to validate. Steam is a storefront, so it’s reasonable to expect a payment method for validation. As excessive as the legislation is, both for the demands being imposed on companies, users and online communities and for the dampening effect this has on important kinds of speech and knowledge, this is a relatively low key approach from Valve.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shame that other options are not available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/xbox-adds-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-the-online-safety-act/">Age verification on Xbox is to be fully enforced from early 2026</a>, and you can prove your age using government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, or credit card checks. I’d like to see Valve add mobile checks as well – you need to provide a phone number as part of adding a credit card anyway, and that’s also a decent datapoint.</p>

<p>Valve commits to processing this data in a manner that is identical to their rest of its data processing for purchases and payments, using an internal payment processing system that meets PCI-DSS standards. If, however, your given card fails the age check, you will need to contact your bank and go through a Steam support process.</p>
<p>Here’s the process for Steam users to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Steam user account.</li>
<li>Visit the Account Details page and click the button labeled “Add a Payment method to this account”.</li>
<li>You will be redirected to a form where you are asked to enter your credit card details.<br>
Required inputs:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card type</li>
<li>Credit card number</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>Expiry date</li>
<li>Name and billing address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click “Continue” to trigger a £0 authorization.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a challenge that is determined by your card issuing bank’s policies, e.g. via one-time-password (OTP) or via app.</li>
<li>If the process is successful, you can now choose to add previously unavailable mature content types on the Store Preferences page.</li>
</ol>

		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Teaser Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ti8cwDNGxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

		<p>Bugbear has released Content Update 3 for their smashtastic racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, adding two new cars, nine new tracks and/or layouts, better AI and plenty more improvements across the Early Access game.</p>
<p>There’s also been fresh teasers of the single player campaign, modding support and more features that will be added, but for now the focus has been on fleshing out and optimising the core content of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #03" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDq8IFt87p8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The two new cars are the Switchback American muscle car, and the Popper European “folk racing” car. You can race them both around the Cannonhill and Savolax tracks (in both directions), while there’s new layouts for the Scrapyard Speedbowl, Figure 8 and Main Circuit, a small oval at Speedway, and the Rallycross 1 circuit can be run in reverse.</p>
<p>More broadly, AI difficulty can now be set to novice, amateur and expert, there’s improved online multiplayer latency, support for telemetry for SimHub and generic systems, and plenty more.</p>
