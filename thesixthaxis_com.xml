		<p>The next Nintendo Direct has been confirmed to take place this week on Friday 12th September at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 10AM EDT / 8AM PDT).</p>



<p>The news has come exclusively through the Nintendo Today app at this moment, and there’s minimal details outside of the date and time. Typically we are given information of the length of time and some kind of indication on the scope of the Direct, whether the focus will be on a particular system, first or third parties, or indies, but the walled garden of information presented within Nintendo Today doesn’t have this.</p>
<p>More information will likely come out as the news spreads to Nintendo’s public social media and the placeholder YouTube stream page goes live.</p>
<p>Until then… we’ll probably get a release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> this time, wouldn’t you think? The game is still set for launch in 2025, and is a significant first party project for both the length of its development and the fact that it’s coming to both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>Dambuster Studio has teased that they’re working on Dead Island 3, a sequel to their hit series revival with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in a note that celebrates 14 years since the first Dead Island game was released by original developer Techland, the studio also noted that over 20 million people have played Dead Island 2 since its release in 2023, before closing out that “the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…”</p>



<p>It looks like Jacob is set to return for the next game, traipsing down a dusty road out of LA, and this could be giving us some clues as to where the next game will be set. The look of the road would suggest that he’s heading toward the desert inland, possibly towards Las Vegas, most likely, but could we be jet setting off to another country? The stickers on his luggage mention Banoi, the island where this series started, and LA, but there’s also stickers for Australia, Ireland and the Coliseum. Obviously these would logically be places where he’s visited in the past, but teasers don’t always have to make too much sense.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2’s success is great to see, given the difficulties that the game went through in getting made. Techland had a messy breakup with publisher Deep Silver (now Plaion) and went off to make their Dying Light series, while the Dead Island franchise stuck with the publisher. They initially partnered with Yager (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a>), but after the game’s announcement at E3 2014, development didn’t progress as planned, and the game was taken away and given to&nbsp;Nottingham-based Dambuster Studios, the team previously behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/homefront-the-revolution">Homefront: The Revolution</a>, but with a longer lineage back through to the TimeSplitters franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a solid return for the zombie smashing series, as I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/18/dead-island-2-review/">Dead Island 2 review</a>, “Dead Island 2 does a great job of reanimating this dormant zombie-battling series, with the gore-filled combat and excessive weaponry that goes well with the oversaturated LA setting. It’s an enjoyable romp, but at the same time, ironically feels like it’s playing it safe.”</p>

		<p>Developer Questline has announced that update 1.1 for its open world dark fantasy RPG Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is now available, and it brings a lot of changes to the game as well fixes. One of the new additions is New Game Plus, but there is also a big nerf of removing gain of crit chance from items due to it being too easy to reach 100% that broke the balancing in New Game Plus. You can read the full patch notes following the trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first big DLC for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> has been announced, with a new mystery to unfurl and new regions within the Olympic Exclusion Zone to explore in Pacific Drive: Whispers in the Woods later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pacific Drive: Whispers in the Woods | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXRk1pFRgOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a brand new story for you and your station wagon to venture into, as a group of Anomaly-obsessed fanatics have come to the OEZ and are making things get even weirder. The DLC promises an 8-12 hours narrative arc that you can branch off and play through within both new and existing saves – it will open up to you after the first few hours – with a new cast of characters and additional side content to discover as well.</p>
<p>The fanatics have come to the OEZ and left their mark, transforming the familiar Pacific Northwest forest with strange altars and new resources. There’s also new anomalies and anomaly behaviours to uncover. Alongside this are Artifcats, a new gameplay system with objects that bring new changes and effects to you and the world around you. Carrying Artifacts will increase the challenge you face, but can also be key to your survival and progress.</p>
<p>Pacific Drive was an indie treat from early last year, blending survival gameplay with needing to maintain and upgrade your station wagon, driving to explore new and more distant areas in a quest to make it through the OEZ.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has announced that its Star Wars inspired Renegades expansion will launch on December 2nd, and the developer has released a developer video to go into some of the content. Renegades has been a collaborative work with Lucasfilm Games to bring elements of Star Wars to Destiny, including lightsabers, the AT-ST Walker, and blasters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the video, the developers draw various comparisons between Destiny in Star Wars. For example, Destiny’s Barant Imperium are like the Empire, the Dredgen are like the Sith, and the Praxic Order are similar to the Jedi. The story itself puts you in the criminal underworld of Destiny’s universe, meaning dealing and allying with various syndicates to reach your goals, with Drifter taking the lead role in your group, going against the orders of The Vanguard. Players will be sent to the Lawless Frontier to work together while using Renegade abilities, to rise up through the ranks of the criminal underworld. The locations of these maps have also been inspired by Star Wars, with Europa having elements of Hoth, Mars has Sarlaac like pits and Venus is like the swamps of Dagobah. The jobs you will be able to undertake include smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage. The Renegade abilities you will be able to equip to help on these jobs are things like air strikes, drop pods, the Cabal Walker, turrets, swoop bikes, interceptors. There are a total of nine abilities and seven upgrades to unlock.</p>
<p>The hub of Destiny 2 Renegades is Tharsis Outpost, which has become a true hive of scum and villainy. The criminal syndicates have set up their headquarters on Tharsis while The Vanguard have been busy elsewhere. The three syndicates that call Thasis Outpost home are the Eliksni Pikers, that are described as a biker gang. The Totality Division is a subset of the Barant Imperium, and is run by Psions. The final group is the Tharsis Reformation, a breakaway Vex group that is learning more about individualism. Bungie has also confirmed that Invasion will return in Renegades too.</p>
