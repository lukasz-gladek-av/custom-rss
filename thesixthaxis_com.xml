			<p>In the search for gaming audio perfection, you’ve got to put a lot of different headsets on a lot of different heads. Turtle Beach know this better than anyone, with an ever-evolving and ever-growing collection of gaming headsets, that show the true nature of a well-oiled research and development cycle. The Stealth 700 has been a staple of that lineup, and with the Gen 3 version, they’ve taken things to the next level, creating a headset that you might not want to take off. Thanks to their various innovations, you won’t have to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Stealth 700 (Gen 3): Rank up to Crossplay Audio" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaKURDqnkxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Priced at £179.99, the Stealth 700 Gen 3 is a wireless and Bluetooth-equipped gaming headset. One of its key selling points is the inclusion of two 2.4GHz USB-A dongles, so you can plug one into your PS5 and the other into your PC, and then seamlessly switch between them via the crossplay button on the right earcup. It’s a great solution for the multi-system gamer.</p>


<p>Turtle Beach have got comfort don’t pat these days. From the Stealth 100 at the lower end of the spectrum, which is now available in a very cool artic camo flavour, through to the Stealth 900, they know how to make a gentle ear cushion or two. The Stealth 700 Gen 3 is super soft and super gentle – this sounds like a child’s shampoo advert, but bear with me – and I couldn’t get over just how plush the headband was every single time I picked it up.</p>
<p>I haven’t been all that kind to the Stealth 700 either, stretching out, and leaving it hanging off monitors, TVs and headphone stands, all of which hasn’t damaged the metal-reinforced headband or ear cushions in any way. Frankly, the Stealth 700 feels bombproof – not something we’re going to be testing.</p>

<p>That build quality is probably why the Stealth 700 is a little chonky. They have all the stealth qualities of a bag of spanners bouncing around on an airport baggage retrieval belt, as they’re amongst the most noticeable headsets you could wear. They still look smart, especially in our review unit’s black and anodised metal review trim, and it’s clear that the design team have taken time improving the visuals over previous iterations, but this is a big pair of headphones, and there’s no getting away from that fact.</p>

<p>The advantage of all that size is that Turtle Beach have been able to pack it with tech, and they’ve made the ear cushions and headband thick and pliant. It’s also a true over-ear headset, fully covering each ear, and ensuring decent passive noise cancellation. You’ll need that too, as their’s no Active Noise Cancellation included, which is something of a shame in a headset at this price. That said, the ANC in competing headsets is never really mind-blowing, so perhaps Turtle Beach have made the pragmatic choice to exclude it.</p>
<p>The Stealth 700 Gen 3 houses an array of on-board controls, from the power button with its surrounding LED, to three dials for volume, chat and WHAT?.<br>
They’ve also packed in two massive 60mm Eclipse dual drivers, each set separating the high and low frequencies, and thanks to their expansive size they’re very capable of pushing a whole heap of audio around. The Stealth 700 Gen 3, as with most of Turtle Beach’s modern headsets, sound excellent. The Signature Sound EQ setting gives you bags of bottom end while maintaining plenty of detail at the top end, so dialogue and sound effects ring through clearly.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and the Stealth 700 has done an amazing job translating monster roars and the epic soundtrack into an enveloping atmosphere. You can absolutely blast your ears off too, as the Stealth 700 Gen 3s go all the way to what feels like 11. There’s some serious output available for the hard-of-hearing, or those seeking hard-of-hearing status later in their lives.</p>

<p>They do a great job with music too. I may be mildly obsessed with the new Linkin Park song – you’ve listened to it non-stop for three days too, right? – and the band’s trademark guitar sound is both powerful and aggressive here, with Emily Armstrong’s vocals careening across the top of it all. If you’re into the heavier side of things, or dance music with thumping drums and grinding bass lines, this is the perfect headset for you.</p>
<p>The microphone boom arm folds back into the left earpiece, so when you’re not using it you wouldn’t even know that it’s there. When you fold it down for use, you can angle it slightly towards your mouth, but it sits in a very rigid position, a very fixed distance from your mouth. While that means it’s should be reliable and offer similar performance every time, there’s no option really for customisation beyond being off or on. Performance is solid though, with a decent representation of your voice flying off into the void.</p>
<p>The Swarm II software is available for iOS, Android and PC, and from here you can make a batch of changes to your headset, including updating it and both transmitters. I was impressed how easy this was to do – many apps need a couple of goes for updating things, or something fails, but here, despite the additional connection points, it all worked impressively well.</p>

<p>Once you’ve updated everything, the app itself gives you extensive access to the workings of the Stealth 700, from a choice of EQs, including a series of custom slots, to tweaking the performance of your microphone, adding and setting a noise gate to prevent unwanted sounds from getting through, to altering the EQ of your voice.</p>
<p>One of the sole issues I found with the Stealth 700 Gen 3 was the blinking LED light that surrounds the power button. In the middle of the night, it was distractingly bright, shining back off the screen of my Nintendo Switch at me, while also annoying my partner as she attempted to go to sleep. There doesn’t seem to be any way of turning this off if you’re solely using the Bluetooth connection, only stopping if the headset hooks up to one of the dongles. It’s a clear issue that can hopefully be remedied by an update, especially if you’re a Nintendo Switch player who’s using the Bluetooth connection as your primary setup. Worst comes to the worst, I guess you can always apply a bit of black tape.</p>

			<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit at the time, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchise’s fortunes is Commandos: Origins, developed by Claymore Game Studios, this a brand-new entry in the series that acts as a prequel to the 90’s original. Despite a noticeable level-up for the visuals, not much has changed for Commandos in the thirty-odd intervening years. Played from an isometric perspective, you guide your squad of up to six Commandos through a vast map, spending most of your time sneaking past sentries or garrotting them and dumping their bodies in some conveniently placed foliage. Thank goodness Nazis don’t have any kind of peripheral vision – must not have been eating their carrots – otherwise they’d definitely spot the hulking Green Beret who is crawling past their ankles, right freaking next to them. All video games take a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, but Commandos: Origins demands a bigger dose than most.</p>


<p>Starting in an Allied prison, deep in Africa, the game immediately introduces us to the aforementioned Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the prison complex, each helping the other to reach their objective. Stealth mechanics are perfunctory, nothing you won’t have experienced a hundred times or more, but reliable. Enemy viewing cones clearly show what your foes can see, allowing you to slip the Commandos through the gaps unnoticed.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting when their unique abilities are unlocked, allowing for some interesting tactics and unique takedowns. Take one of the earliest set-ups by way of an example, where the Sapper places a mantrap, whilst the Green Berret hides a radio nearby to lure the patrolling German to his snapping demise. Very welcome here is the visual depiction of sound waves, ensuring you know exactly who will be alerted once the radio is activated.</p>


<p>This all sounds quite promising, and it would be, if not for one enormous caveat. Commandos: Origins has amongst the worst gamepad I’ve had the misfortune to wrestle with in a console RTS. I know that transferring a game intended to be played with mouse and keyboard to work on consoles is hugely challenging, but games like Shadow Tactics prove that it can be done. Claymore Game Studios sadly didn’t take to heart any of the lessons learned by the shinobi-based RTS classic. Instead, their chosen controller implementation is fussy, finicky and, on far too many occasions, borderline unplayable.</p>
<p>Controlling the camera is a bad joke, squeezing triggers and wobbling thumb sticks in a desperate attempt to see what you need to see to actually play the game. It’s deeply unwieldy, and makes setting up cunning plans involving sniper rifles, dinghies and stolen jeeps a deeply frustrating, laborious and time-consuming affair. Selecting commandos, choosing their abilities, activating a takedown, everything is unintuitive and, worst of all, laggy. Far too often my elite squad was rumbled simply because the spy handles like a brick coated in baby oil, failing to get out of the enemy sightlines in time. For a turn-based game these foibles might be more forgivable, but in a real time strategy game, one in which there are numerous moving parts to manage to succeed, these controls are game-breaking.</p>

<p>If you are able to grin and bear it with the controls (or are playing with mouse &amp; keyboard) there’s a lot to like about Commandos: Origins. Levels in general are humongous, intricate and complex, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Most take several hours to fully complete, and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters. There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, allowing for open and free-form strategizing, with numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves.</p>
<p>Your commandos rarely start in the same location, instead they weave and wind their way around the environments, assisting each other in intuitive and creative ways. Sniping out guards to open the path for your driver on the other side of the map, ferrying commandos to flank the enemy in an inflatable dingy, crashing lorries through checkpoints, or just pulling out the machine guns and going wild, the potential strategies are varied, and many objectives are entirely optional. These tactics are enabled, and the gamepad controls <em>almost</em> made bearable, by the handy ability to pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly plan carried out.</p>

<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters crawling under barbed wires, kicking down doors, or chocking out Nazis. Landscapes are varied and interesting, from sand coated deserts, to ancient Germanic forests, and icy-cold tundra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are let down by some noticeable frame-rate drops, particularly when the bullets start flying, causing the game to be even harder to control than before. There’s plenty of visual glitches too, with Commandos regularly murdering the air next to an enemy, only for the untouched guard to fall-down dead anyway. Worse, lots of screen tears accompany camera movement, making that already lacklustre aspect of the game nausea-inducing to boot.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Commandos: Origins is probably very good; an interesting historical setting, charming visuals, and deep and varied strategic options. You won’t notice any of that if playing on console however, you’ll be too busy wrestling with the terrible controls to be having much fun. That, and the buggy visuals, make this one to be missed unless you're on PC.	</p></div>
