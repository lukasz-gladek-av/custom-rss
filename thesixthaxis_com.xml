<p>In our MIO: Memories In Orbit review, I said, <em>“MIO: Memories In Orbit is an early contender for one of the most memorable games of 2026. It is an incredibly challenging game to play, with combat being a highlight, even if some platforming section can be frustrating. It looks fantastic, though, and the story is well told. MIO: Memories In Orbit draws you in, and does not let go easily. It is hard game but the journey is worth experiencing.”</em></p>
