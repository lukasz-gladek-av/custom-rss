		<p>Incoming Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma has spent a lot of the time since being announced and taking on the role trying to spread a positive message for the future of Xbox, giving reassurance to Xbox gamers by stating that she is committed to a “return to Xbox”, and also that the current Xbox strategy is under review.</p>
<p>“The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan,” she said in <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">an interview with Windows Central</a>, which is… helpful.</p>


<p>In her full quotes, she says:</p>
<p>“I think that our core Xbox fans and players have invested up to 25 years of themselves in these universes and our console. I want to make sure everybody knows I’m committed to Xbox, starting with the console. We’re going to keep meeting players where they are — the world continues to evolve and change. We’re going to make sure Xbox is a great place for developers and players. We want to invest in reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices that they want to use with us. I think that’s going to mean a lot more investment in breaking down the barriers, in helping developers build once and show up across different hardware experiences. For me, I believe Xbox starts with its fans, and we’ll grow from there. That’s what I wanted to signal with the “return” to Xbox.”</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that, console will remain a pillar for Xbox, but that Microsoft are still going to push ahead with more game streaming, more Windows gaming and cross-platform games.</p>

<p>Then again…</p>
<p>“Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p>
<p>So, maybe exclusivity is back on the menu?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s probably not going to happen as soon as she’s able to look at the revenue breakdown per platform. Releasing games on PlayStation will likely provide a major revenue stream that Xbox cannot give back when their console player base is so far behind.</p>
<p>The problem from the outside looking in is that there doesn’t seem to have been a cohesive plan over the last few years. Outside of Call of Duty, there’s no way of knowing which games will be cross-platform on day one, which games will be held back from PlayStation for half a year, which for a year. Change the plan down the line, but maybe make it a bit clearer?</p>
<p>Booty also commented to say that gamers should not expect dramatic changes in the near future, while also saying that they still intend to be a first party platform holder.</p>
<h3>Further reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">Hero to Net Zero – What is Phil Spencer’s legacy at Xbox?</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-with-coreai-exec-asha-sharma-taking-over-as-microsoft-gaming-ceo/">announced last week</a>, Asha Sharma has taken over as CEO, retaining Matt Booty in a slightly more senior role as Chief Content Officer, while Phil Spencer is retiring and Sarah Bond has quit as Xbox President. While Spencer has stated that he had decided months ago to retire and organised a succession plan with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it was a snap change announced on Friday and taking effect on Monday.</p>
<p>Despite this supposed planning, Sharma is seemingly now engaging in a massive discovery tour. Not really being a gamer prior to taking on this job, and with her background as an AI division executive at Meta and Microsoft, she’s taken recommendations from social media for games to try. She’s also repeatedly stated that she is learning where the Xbox business is currently at… which, look… shouldn’t that have been taking place through the last few months? Or wouldn’t it have been better to announce a longer, more managed handover so this could take place? That’s clearly on Spencer and Nadella.</p>

		<p>French publisher <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nacon">Nacon</a> has filed for insolvency and suspended trading of the company’s shares, as its majority stakeholder and parent company, Bigben Interactive, is currently going through serious financial difficulties. This could make the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-_DHPUqRYw">Nacon Connect stream on 4th March</a> quite awkward…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bigben-interactive">Bigben Interactive</a> defaulting on a €43 million bond repayment has sent shockwaves through its subsidiary. Nacon is now looking for a way to regain its own financial liquidity, filing for insolvency with the courts and looking for a reorganisation to continue operating.</p>


<p>Separtely, <a href="https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/fb7bf5ba-1be7-4b4c-98d2-53fdfc9d28c9">Bigben is also filing to the courts</a> for an “amicable conciliation procedure” to enter into discussions with its creditors and restructure its debts.</p>
<p>This feels like a strange situation where Bigben is passing its troubles on through a bit of a shell game, though Bigben’s own stocks have taken a major tumble. We will just have to cross our fingers that things are able to be worked out, as unlikely as that feels, or Nacon’s studios and IP could end up being shut down or sold off.</p>
<p>The courts decisions are expected in the coming days of late February and early March.</p>

<p>Nacon is a merger of two Bigben brands, having previously published games under Bigben Interactive and sold gaming accessories as Nacon. It’s grown over the last decade to own around a dozen studios, from racing game specialists Kylotonn (who recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/">regained the WRC license</a>) to RPG studio Spiders who have a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/greedfall-the-dying-world-gets-a-march-release-date/">GreedFall</a> on the way in March, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx">Styx</a> developer Cyanide. The Nacon Connect stream taking place next week is expected to feature new game announcements and trailers for Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series.</p>
<p>The full statement reads:</p>
<p>In a video game sector marked by long investment cycles and significant transformations, on 20 February 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations.</p>
<p>The Company indicated on this occasion that its liquidity situation required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations, and that it was considering procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court.</p>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this context, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency <span><i>(“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) </i></span>with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings <span><i>(“redressement </i></span><span><i>judiciaire”)</i></span>. The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework.</p>
<p>This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.</p>
<p>The employee representative organisations were informed of this decision on 24 February 2026.</p>
<p>The Court, at a hearing expected in early March, will rule on this request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings <span><i>(“redressement judiciaire”</i></span>).</p>
<p>Pending this decision and given the uncertainties regarding the outcome of the proceedings, the suspension of the Company’s share price, announced on 20 February 2026, remains in effect.</p>
<p>The Company will keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.</p>
