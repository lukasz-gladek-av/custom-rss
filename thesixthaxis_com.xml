		<p>Wildlight has released a brand new patch for Highguard with the main feature being a brand new mode. That mode is Raid Rush in which two teams of five take turns to defend and attack bases, with the addition that there is no looting phase. Instead, between rounds players will be able to upgrade weapons and equipment by interacting with the Trader at their base, with equipment changing between each round. 3v3 Raids have been disabled while Raid Rush is active.</p>

<h2>Highguard Raid Rush update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Comeback Kill&nbsp;</b>– Grab a kill after going on a death streak of 3 or more and get rewarded 2 Vesper per death, on top of the 3 for the kill. You’re back in the game!<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reviver Amulet</b>&nbsp;– bonus revive speed reduced from 50% to 15%.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><i>Dev Note: We feel like the speed of a Reviver Amulet revive was creating too much safety for mid-combat revives.</i><wbr></li>
<li><b>Smuggler’s Den</b>&nbsp;– added more defender respawns<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weapon Balance Updates</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Vanguard –&nbsp;<b>Reducing accuracy and controllability – it’s too dominant across long ranges</b><wbr></li>
<li>Dynasty –&nbsp;<b>Buffing damage to provide a better tradeoff for the challenging recoil. It now takes one fewer bullet to kill against blue, purple, and gold shields</b><wbr></li>
<li>Corsair –&nbsp;<b>Reducing the delay before the recoil pattern resets, so that the Corsair can be fired more quickly without sacrificing accuracy</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn –&nbsp;<b>Increased fire rate to make the Longhorn more versatile, making it more viable at medium and close ranges.</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn (Repeater) –&nbsp;<b>Hipfire accuracy buffed to satisfy the end game power spike feeling</b><wbr></li>
<li>Viper –&nbsp;<b>Reducing controllability when using the 2x Optic in order to balance out its long range power</b><wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some wall geo you could walk through at Belltower in Kingdom<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed Firing Range base select being too short</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirms-layoffs-just-weeks-after-launch/">Wildlight confirmed layoffs just weeks after launch&nbsp;</a>of Highguard. We enjoyed in our first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard</a>. Dom said,<em> “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>
