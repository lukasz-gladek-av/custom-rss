		<p>The ever delightful Gearbox CEO, Randy Pitchford, has reminded PC players in his own unique style that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/"> Borderlands 4</a> has minimum spec requirements and it’s not going to work very well on older PCs.</p>
<p>His comments follow PC gamers complaining of performance issues and suggested that players need to “learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game”.</p>


<p>“The minimum and recommended specs are published. The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware”, he<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985"> tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features. This is not a game made to run on 10 year old PC’s – this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU.”</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”</p>

			<p>The recent release of Chibi-Robo on the Switch 2 Online service was welcome news as the Gamecube title is one of my favourite games of all time. The adventures of a tiny robot whose purpose is to clean may not have sounded like the most exciting premise for a game, but the charm and design elevated it to a true classic. Misc. A Tiny Tale is very clearly inspired by the earlier game and offers a more linear and focused take on the gameplay elements while retaining the charm and humour in spades.</p>
<p><iframe title="Misc. A Tiny Tale - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlRa1fpf_d4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whilst Chibi-Robo has a lot of interactions between Chibi and the humans in the house, Misc takes place in a posthuman world where all that is left is the remains of civilisation and a new world is being built by tiny robots. This seemingly grim future is not a depressing setting per se, and instead serves to provide an empty playground for the robots to take centre stage. There is the subtle suggestion that humanity has brought about its own downfall, but this is more of a context than a narrative point. The end result, however, is that a story devoid of humans is paradoxically filled with humanity.</p>


<p>You play as Buddy, a cute little robot with a basic range of platforming abilities and a seemingly bottomless capacity for trash (a trait I can certainly identify with). You can jump, both single and double, hover to reach distant platforms, and move and carry objects. Nothing revolutionary by any means but the tools at your disposal are well used to make each level feel developed and interesting. The biggest nod to Chibi Robo (aside from picking up rubbish) is the little brush you use to clean up stains and spills. This tiny mechanic feels far more satisfying than it should – especially when you’re sat in a messy room trying to avoid actual housework.</p>


<p>The world of Misc is wonderfully detailed and full of character. While it plays out in distinct levels rather than an integrated map this does help to give each area a feel of its own. You’ll travel through various different villages, desolate areas, a junkyard, and even an abandoned human-scale house. Along the way you’ll help a varied cast of other tiny robots and get to know more about your protagonist and his best friend Bag Boy. The latter is distinguished by wearing a paper bag for reasons that only become apparent in the later levels of the game. He is also constantly accompanied by a grumpy and eternally hungry robot cat – which is always a plus point.</p>
<p>The immediate backstory for Misc involves a mysterious explosion that is the catalyst for Buddy’s big adventure. The explosion leaves strange golden cogs scattered around the world – cogs that are needed to activate the doors at the end of each level. While there are ten to find in each stage, only eight are required to progress, whilst there are also incentives to clean all the stains and pick up every piece of rubbish. The levels are easily replayed through the map screen and it is clear what you still have to do in each – although there are times when you’ll need to scour the map to find the last piece of rubbish or spillage. Fortunately you can buy a radar tracker once you’ve found all the golden cogs on a level to help you track down any missed objects.</p>

<p>Some golden cogs are located in difficult to reach areas and require accurate platforming skills whilst others are rewards for helping out other bots. Requests range from watering all the plants in a garden to finding an accessory to make a staple remover hydra feel less intimidating. The main connecting tissue is Buddy, an endlessly optimistic (despite being voiceless) presence who is driven by a pure curiosity and desire to help.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Misc. A Tiny Tale is a real hidden gem. The quality of the level design, the amount of emotional heft in the narrative, and the sheer joy of exploration in the game make it feel like a true successor to Chibi-Robo. Even if it doesn’t quite have the scope of Nintendo’s title, it's a pleasure from beginning to end.	</p></div>
