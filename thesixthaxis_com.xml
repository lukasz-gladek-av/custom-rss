		<p>The days of video games playing second fiddle to films, comics and cartoons are far behind us. If anything, it’s often games that are now leading the way and providing source material to be adapted into anime, books and billion dollar films.</p>
<p>But what if you take a more holistic approach with a transmedia project planned from the off?</p>



<p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby took the world by storm earlier this year, when this free-to-play athlete-management &amp; deckbuilding hybrid experience about anime girls with horse ears finally got its global release. While the franchise is only just beginning to explode in popularity for English-speaking audiences this year, it’s been one of the hottest multi-media property in Japan for years, spawning manga and anime tie-ins galore.</p>
<p>One of those tie-ins, the currently airing Umamusume: Cinderella Gray, is a breath-taking blend of hot-blooded anime action, endearing horse girl silliness, and some of the sharpest animation you’ll ever see. It tones down the cutesy and silly vibes that usually drive most of the Umamusume experience, instead going for a cool, tense, and gripping origin story for one of the many characters in the series that ends up skewing closer to a traditional sports anime or even action classics like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Naruto in terms of tone and pacing. It’s an incredible reflection of one of the many layers of the Umamusume franchise, and I’ve already got some new favorite characters to unlock and train in the game after watching this anime.</p>

<h3>Devil May Cry (Netflix) – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The streamers have been ravaging the gaming world for IPs they can turn into animations with mixed results, for every Arcane: League of Legends there is a Tomb Raider, and while Devil May Cry may not be the cream of the crop it is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>The Netflix series pulls storylines and details from almost every incarnation of DMC, including characters found in the DMC novels and Manga, and mixes them up to create a lighter version of DMC. There are still dark moments, especially when it comes to the main antagonist, Rabbit, but Dante is portrayed as rather young and goofy, with none of the brooding or trauma found in the games. There are some great needle drops throughout the series, all from the 2000’s when DMC was at it’s height, along with a few classic tracks from the games, and while the mix of 2D and CG animation can clash somewhat, there are some spectacular sequences.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry is gory, sweary, funny, and packed full of action, and while it may not be what you personally think DMC is, it’s a darn fun ride. Series 2 lands on Netflix in May 2026.</p>

<h3>A Minecraft Movie – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Is A Minecraft Movie a good movie? It probably depends on who you ask. If you’re a kid who’s grown up playing Minecraft, whose understanding of it is as deep and creative as any other physical building system, then the answer is likely a categorical ‘yes’.</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is silly, irreverent, and often nonsensical, but it’s also playful, creative and built to specifically reference every aspect of the game that inspired it. Cinemas were filled with all sorts of crazy Minecraft-inspired behaviour, inspiring joy and fervour in a shared pop culture moment, although that occasionally spilt out into extremes, such as the fans who unleashed live chickens into a theatre in reaction to the Lava Chicken song.</p>
<p>Households, streets and school playgrounds were filled with the sound of that song, and it epitomised the union between the game and the movie. Nobody could have expected Jack Black’s shenanigans to hit the right notes with fans, but they absolutely did.</p>
