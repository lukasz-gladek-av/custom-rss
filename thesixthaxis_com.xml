<p><em>“Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.”</em> said Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director. <em>“A special thanks goes to&nbsp;KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series – especially in terms of the driving model – in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can’t wait to share the journey with you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A rally version of Assetto Corsa, when?! It has been one of the most frequent questions I’ve received over these years, and I can finally provide an answer.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, Co-Founder of KUNOS Simulazioni and the Assetto Corsa franchise and Executive Manager for KUNOS Simulazioni.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches into early access, the content players will have access to includes 33km of fully laser scanned real life roads, four Special Stages with 18 variants, set across gravel roads in Wales and tarmac roads in Alsace, 10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles,<br>
five game modes, and triple screen support. The content aim for the full release includes over 120 km of laser scanned real life roads, ten Special Stages with more than 35 variants across 5 international rallies, with new roads and content added continuously, a car roster featuring over 30 vehicles, new game modes, a rally school, a career mode, and complete VR support. A release date for all of that additional content has not yet been confirmed. Assetto Corsa Rally will also feature an advanced damage system which will show both visual damage and impact car performance.</p>

		<p>Pathea Games has announced that the alpha playtest for My Time At Evershine will begin on October 24th, and it will be for those who pledged $35 or more to the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam PC version of the game. Steam keys are going to be going out on October 21st and redeemable through PledgeManager, with My Time At Evershine then being available to download on October 24th. The key that is being sent out is not for the full game, as a separate key for that will be sent when the game is ready to release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reveal Teaser| My Time at Evershine" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubgnFCW2m3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Those who have backed My Time At Evershine on Kickstarter but chose a console version are not eligible for the alpha playtest. However, that can be changed by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fill out the&nbsp;<b>[<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FM4qmMVsc6uVHAw1TA">Google Form here</a>]</b>&nbsp;to register your request. &nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>If you already selected Steam (PC) previously, you don’t need to fill out this form – unless you now want to switch from&nbsp;<b>Steam</b>&nbsp;(PC) to&nbsp;<b>console</b>&nbsp;instead.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>We’ll collect all responses and upload them to PledgeManager.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Once processed, you’ll receive a new invitation email to reopen your PledgeManager survey and select Steam. If you can’t find the invitation email, simply log back into PledgeManager to check your survey.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>The deadline for this first batch of console-to-PC requests is&nbsp;<b>October 22nd, 18:00 (UTC+8)</b>. That’s&nbsp;<b>03:00 AM PST / 06:00 AM EST / 12:00 PM CET.</b><wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Please double-check your selection when switching to Steam. Once your Steam key is assigned, your&nbsp;<b>Alpha platform</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<b>locked</b>&nbsp;and cannot be changed again.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>This round only covers&nbsp;<b>console-to-Steam switches for Alpha access.</b>&nbsp;Other cases – like switching between consoles or standard PC (non-Alpha) keys – will be handled later.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first round of keys being sent out for the My Time At Evershine alpha playtest, with this running until the game is released properly. If you do get into the playtest you will not be allowed to share any images, videos or thoughts about My Time At Evershine outside of the Pathea Games official channels.</p>

		<p>Marvel has announced the first ever PvE mode for its free to play hero shooter Marvel Rivals, with this crossover being suitably in season. From October 23rd, a new Zombies mode inspired by Marvel Zombies will be released for Marvel Rivals, allowing players to team up and take on hordes of the undead until they become overwhelmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="First-Ever PvE Mode: Marvel Zombies I Announce Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xBptgEhiok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There are some limits to the Marvel Rivals Zombie mode such as the playable characters. Players will only be able to play as Thor, Jeff, Magik, The Punisher, or Blade. Eventually, after the hordes get dealt with you will face off against bosses Zombie Namor and The Queen of the Dead. Each playable hero will have a unique ability to deal with the zombie waves. Jeff will be able to charge through groups, Blade will be armed with a bouncing Moon Blade, Thor will be able to shock zombies in his Awakened state, and Magik has an unlimited Darkchild form.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-will-be-out-next-week-bringing-daredevil-and-cross-progression-with-it/">Marvel Rivals Season 4.5</a> adding Dardevil to the roster, along with cross progression for a small group of players so it could be tested, and &nbsp;another round of Team-Up Ability adjustments such as removing Ragnarok Rebirth (Hela – Thor) and taking Namor out of Gamma Charge (Hulk – Namor/Black Panther). Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor).</p>
