<p><em>Battle for planet Kronus as Warhammer 40,000’s ultimate RTS returns, featuring the largest campaign ever with four distinct factions battling it out in epic, brutal large-scale conflicts. At last, back to war!</em></p>
<p><em>Take charge of four unique Warhammer 40,000 factions: the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus in their Dawn of War debut. Each faction grants you total control of a unique collection of Commanders, units, buildings and gameplay mechanics that dramatically alter the feel and flow of Warhammer 40,000’s endless, brutal warfare.</em></p>

<p><em>Co-written by the legendary Black Library author John French, Dawn of War IV’s epic story represents the biggest Dawn of War saga to date. In solo or co-op play, command each faction through its own dedicated campaign, supported by spectacular CGI intros and fully animated cutscenes.</em></p>
<p><em>The series returns to its roots with classic Dawn of War gameplay and a combat system designed to bring Warhammer 40,000’s bloodthirsty combat to life like never before. Grow your force, build your base of operations specialise your squads, and savour an expanded Sync Kill system that delivers an unprecedented degree of melee combat detail.</em></p>
<p><em>Enjoy an endlessly replayable collection of game modes, including the return of fan-favourite Last Stand! Fight highly-configurable AI battles in Skirmish, or take on the world in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer. Wherever you’re waging war, use the Painter tool to stamp your own unique personality on your fighting forces, as well as the option to use existing factions from the Warhammer 40,000 universe.</em></p>

		<p>TT Games and Warner Bros. have revealed their next big LEGO game – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC!</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the definitive, essential Batman story, going from origin to legend. Train with the League of Shadows, fight crime in Gotham, face off against the Joker, Penguin, Bane (voiced by Matt Berry!) and plenty more, referencing TV, comics, movies and games, all mushed together in the TT Games way. This latest Lego game looks to build on the legacy of both the previous Lego Batman games and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The combat features powerful attacks, counters, combos in more of an Arkham Asylum way.&nbsp;This game will have difficulty levels for the first time – Dark Knight mode will ramp things up – and you will build a family of Bat-allies.</p>
<p>Oh, and Gotham is a big open world as well to explore how you see fit.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, we said “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious Lego game yet, and despite the occasional technical mishap it delivers a daring and often delightful romp through the most iconic film franchise of all time.”</p>

		<p>Long-awaited sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a> now has a launch window, and is set to launch in late 2025 for Xbox and Steam, and it will be day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH5ZYM3nCP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong> – Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay </strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong> – The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown </strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. Before a brief check in back in July, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">the previous update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>
