		<p>Green Flamingo Games has announced a brand new 3D rhythm platformer called Spanky’s Battle Swing, and it takes inspiration from the cartoons of the 1930’s blending them with a soundtrack filled with electro swing jazz. The teaser trailer gives a glimpse at the platforming action, as well as a taster of the soundtrack.</p>

<p>In Spanky’s Battle Swing you play as Spanky The Bat as he navigates around the city of Metronopolis, a place where everything moves to the music. Spanky is not a fan of the constant noise and the way the city functions because of the music, so he is on a quest to shut it all up by getting to Mayor Metrognome. There are different districts in Metronopolis which each have their own music beats, tricks and guardians to take down. The key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhythm-Driven Platforming:</strong>&nbsp;Every foe, platform, and hazard moves to the beat—learn the pattern, bend the pattern,&nbsp;<strong>own</strong>&nbsp;the pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Electro-Swing Soundtrack:</strong>&nbsp;A punchy, dynamic score that keeps the city buzzing and your feet tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Vintage Cartoon Flair:</strong>&nbsp;A lively, personality-packed world with expressive characters and a 1930s-inspired look.</li>
<li><strong>Rebel Against the Beat:</strong>&nbsp;As Spanky, you can sync up… or go off-grid. Break timing rules to create your own openings and shut the city up—your way.</li>
</ul>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Spanky’s Battle Swing, but it will be coming out in 2026 for PC.</p>

		<p>If there is a mode that players love in Call of Duty, it is Zombies. It has been a staple since Call of Duty: World At War. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 continues the zombie tradition and there is now a trailer showing some gameplay from the upcoming release, backed with AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. There has also been confirmation that those who pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will get to play Zombies Survival in the beta.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Zombies Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07SF99EeZ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Black Ops 7 story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil. Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon. There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>
