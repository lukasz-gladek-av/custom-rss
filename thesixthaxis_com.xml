		<p>Indie psychological horror hit Mouthwashing is coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch in 2025, developer Wrong Organ and publisher CR Channel have announced. The game will have both a digital and physical release.</p>
<p>Mouthwashing released in September last year for PC, the game immediately getting plenty of attention for its dark narrative, in which five crew members of The Pony Express deal with dwindling resources and extreme isolation, descending into madness that’s accentuated by the retro PSX visual style.</p>


<p>The game has just passed the 500,000 sales mark on PC, with the team writing that this “honestly feels more surreal than any bizzaro psychosis.” They continue, “Everyone, you truly are incredible and we’re extremely grateful to you for taking a part in this painful journey and on behalf of everyone here both at Wrong Organ and CR Channel we want to say thank you!”</p>
<p>The next port of call is the aforementioned console releases. They’ve teamed up with Fangamer for a run of the game in physical form, alongside a digital release on both platforms. You can <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/pages/mouthwashing-physical-edition">sign up to be notified</a> of the physical edition’s availability –&nbsp;it’s sure to be in high demand, like so many indie game physical prints.</p>

<p>The Fangamer partnership will go beyond just the physical game, with a bunch of Mouthwashing merch that will include apparel, plushies, vinyl and more.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> and developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> achieved a landmark success with their reboot of the long-running <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise. As we concluded in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, there’s no going back for the series now that it has established a strong new gameplay formula – then along comes Warriors: Abyss.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warriors: Abyss - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jn238X1UXoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This wonderfully experimental spin on the Musou template offers up a Roguelite remix that apes the action-packed lunacy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. From a top-down perspective, you’ll descend into an underworld overrun by demonic nasties, playing as one of the many characters from the combined Dynasty Warriors and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> rosters.</p>


<p>Despite the shift in perspective, Warriors: Abyss will feel instantly familiar to Koei fans. Each of the 100+ heroes have had their own unique movesets lifted from past games in the Warriors series to give them all a distinct flavour. You’ll be met with little resistance against the waves of rank and file grunts who may occasionally try and get a swing in as you clobber them by the dozen. However, as you advance between waves, these enemies will be flanked by an increasingly diverse menagerie of monsters – each run of Warriors: Abyss will inevitably climax with hundreds of foes writhing on-screen beneath a chaotic purple lattice of telegraphed attack indicators.</p>
<p>To help cleave through the madness, players have plenty of loadout options at their disposal. Between phases (in which you’re usually required to KO a set number of enemies or complete a specific mission) you’ll have the option to recruit other heroes into your Formation, each offering stat bonuses and abilities. For your first few runs you’ll likely ignore the finer details of these mechanics, but you’ll quickly find there’s plenty of options to tweak your playstyle, collecting specific heroes to find synergies and unlock powerful upgrades whether that’s an increased attack range/speed or imbuing your weapon with one of several element types.</p>


<p>Recruited heroes can also be assigned to the six attack combos each character comes equipped with. Once you pull off a combo you can hit the special attack button again to summon that designated hero and have them pull off their own flashy move. Naturally, Warriors Abyss also brings back Musou attacks with an additional gauge allowing you to assemble the heroes in your formation and have them wreak havoc on-screen until it depletes.</p>
<p>At its peak, Warriors Abyss conjures a whirlwind of total destruction that can barely be contained from both a gameplay and technical perspective with the PS5 version occasionally dropping frames. Even for seasoned Musou fans whose virtual body counts climb into the millions, this chaotic display will prove overwhelming yet it’s true to the genre. To help master the chaos, you can spend the in-game currency you acquire to unlock and upgrade heroes between each run while also tracking down each of their unique weapons while exploring the underworld.</p>

<p>Your end goal is to make it as far as you can through Gouma’s gauntlet, eventually going toe-to-toe with the game’s main antagonist. Instead of chucking ending waves of enemies in your path, you’ll advance between stages with each area/biome culminating in a boss fight. These are pretty damn tough with punishing attacks that will force you to think carefully, dodging with precise timing and planning your hero summons.</p>
<p>Due to the near unreadable number of effects popping off on-screen at any one time, visual artistry isn’t a primary focus. Each of the Warriors character models are excellently designed (with plenty of costume DLC up for grabs) yet you see very little of them amidst the swarm of demons and a never-ending onslaught of screen-filling attack animations. There’s very little appealing about the enemy or environment designs and though some fans will take an interest in the narrative that weaves together playthroughs, I opted to skip most of the dialogue.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		With the mainline Musou series entering a new era, Warriors Abyss is a fun yet flawed repurposing of past games that feels like a sendoff, as if Omega Force is closing the book after a very long chapter.	</p></div>
