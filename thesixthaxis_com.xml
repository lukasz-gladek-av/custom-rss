		<p>Today, EA Sports is releasing the EA Sports FC 25 gameplay refresh update, a major overhaul of the on the pitch action with defending, passing, shooting, goalkeeping, and player movement all having changes applied. Some of the changes include not having defenders catch up to attacking players as quickly, and toning down the number of AI interceptions.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
