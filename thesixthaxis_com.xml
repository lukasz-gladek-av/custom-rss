		<p>Styx: Blades of Greed is going to be released on February 19th 2026, Nacon has confirmed with the game coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Nacon and Cyanide Studio were originally aiming for a 2025 release date, but the development team needs a few more months to polish the Styx: Blades of Greed experience.</p>

<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which has led to a now trilogy of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control. These abilities will be used alongside Styx’s shadowy skills and various gadgets to help in his mission to get the quartz.</p>

<p>In our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed, Stefan said, <em>“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</em></p>

		<p>Paradox Tinto has remained busy after the release of Europa Universalis V last month, pushing out a clutch of patches and with a testing regime for upcoming changes.
