		<p>Despite having previously said they were done with developing and improving <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red has just release Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which brings with it a fresh set of customisation options and an overhauled photo mode… and some bonus secrets.</p>
<p><iframe title="REDstreams — Cyberpunk 2077 | Update 2.2 Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIlOthAEggI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The photo mode overhaul is going to be the biggest new feature for keen video game shutterbugs. It now gives a fully independent Drone Camera that’s no longer set to orbit around V, and has an increased range. You can also toggle collision detection on and off, lock it, set a precision mode, spawn up to 3 NPCs to adjust and pose how you wish, spawn light sources, set effect intensity, and more.</p>
<p>That will go nicely with the expanded character customisation options with more eye colours, lip make up types, nail colours, scars, eyebrows, tattoos and on and on. The character creator randomiser now has a Plain-to-Punk slider as well, if you just want a vibe quickly.</p>
<p>More cars can use the Rayfield CrystalCoat tech, which lowers NCPD wanted level, and Twintone lets you scan a car you’re driving past and zap its colour scheme to your car in a flash.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there’s a smattering of other bug fixes and quality of life tweaks, and the curious note, “Added more secrets to discover in Night City.”</p>
<p>Intriguing.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2 patch notes:</p>
<h4><strong>New Features</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield’s CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle’s color scheme for a small fee. You’ll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you’ll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
<li>The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>
<li>Archer Quartz EC-L r275</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 640 TS</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 680 TS</li>
<li>Mahir Supron FS3-T</li>
<li>Villefort Deleon V410-S Coupe (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
<li>Mizutani Hozuki MH2 (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what’s happening.</li>
<li>We’ve overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) – determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) – locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) – slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V’s apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/interface-sp/issue/2743/smartframe-and-the-gallery-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support article</a>.</li>
<li>Added more character customization options:
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upgraded the Character Creator randomizer to feature a new Plain-to-Punk slider. Whether you’re aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance.</li>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn’t always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>
<li><em>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor</em> – Fixed an issue where no shard could be found on the cyberpsycho’s body, blocking progress.</li>
<li><em>Dream On</em> – The Trauma Team AV on the roof will now be properly hidden in stealth mode.</li>

</ul>
<h4><strong>Phantom Liberty-Specific</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Balls to the Wall</em> – Fixed an issue where it was impossible to exit the elevator and talk to Yuri because of an invisible wall.</li>
<li><em>Firestarter</em> – Fixed an issue where fast travel could be blocked if the player saved the game soon after exiting Reed’s car.</li>
<li><em>Gig: Waiting for Dodger</em> – After being freed, Bill and Charles will now be more mindful of their driving and avoid running over Dodger’s goons, preventing any unnecessary combat.</li>
<li><em>Hi Ho Silver Lining</em> – The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn’t meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li><em>I’ve Seen That Face Before</em> – The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li><em>Run This Town</em> – The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>
<li><em>Somewhat Damaged</em> – Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li><em>The Killing Moon</em> – Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the Synaptic Accelerator to stay active indefinitely if the player is detected while not in combat.</li>
<li>The car horn will no longer honk when the player reloads a weapon during vehicle combat while playing with a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the NCPD could stop functioning properly after V engages in a shootout in Pacifica between the Voodoo Boys and Trauma Team.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where TV program sound was muted or too quiet.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where CrystalCoat™did not apply properly after entering a vehicle.</li>
<li>Due to popular demand, we’ve lowered the <em>Trauma Drama</em> high scores.</li>
<li>Adjusted V’s mouth movement in various scenes, including the endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>PC-Specific</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Toem 2 was teased during the Wholesome Snack stream, revealing that a sequel to the black and white game of photography is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOEM 2 Teaser Trailer | Wholesome Snack 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze4DSeIhYAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s just a little bit of blurb about the game from developer Something We Made:</p>
<p>Step back into the shoes of a curious photographer and set off on a brand new adventure all about uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world’s little wonders in TOEM 2, the sequel to the acclaimed TOEM.</p>
<p>Yup, it’s a straight up sequel and looks to be following very much in the photographs of footprints of the original. You’ll play as a keen shutterbug who’s keen to explore the world around them through the lens of their camera, as you explore there’s plenty of people to help out with your photography skills, earning stamps needed to get the next free bus trip to another place.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, is in black and white, which gives the game its distinctive look.</p>
<p>For our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/toem-review-a-delightful-photo-adventure/">the original Toem</a>, Nic said, “Toem might be short, but with the number of challenges, and you can finish it an afternoon if you’re looking for something fun and relaxing to throw yourself at, or dip in and out to complete every little side mission. With the winter evenings drawing in, Toem is the kind of game I can see myself coming back to with a hot chocolate and a blanket, as I settle in to bring a little joy to the denizens of the world of Toem.”</p>
