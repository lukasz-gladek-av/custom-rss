		<p>Marvel Rivals has managed to maintain a good amount of momentum through its first year, and that’s set to continue with Netease announcing that Season 4.5: Heart of the Dragon, the midway point for the mainline season, will release next Friday, October 10th. The headline additions are always characters, and this time is no different, bringing the iconic Daredevil to the roster, alongside the Man With No Fear’s melee combat-heavy moveset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is definitely a slightly different take on the character than the Matt Murdock we’ve seen embodied by Charlie Cox on Netflix and Disney, with the Marvel Rivals’ version sounding much gruffer and tougher. Visually, his armourset has clear Eastern influence, with Samurai-esque pauldrons on each shoulder, though I’d expect his more traditional look to pop up as part of the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Daredevil fits into the Duelist class, and his radar sense makes all evil visible; nothing escapes his “sight.” In combat, he can pick a priority target based on the situation, use his agility to close the gap, and unleash rapid attacks with his Billy Clubs. When facing tough opponents, Daredevil taps into The Beast’s power, amplifying his martial arts for even more deadly strikes! Activate his Ultimate Ability, and Daredevil fully unleashes The Beast. Any enemy who dares look at him will be gripped by fear, awaiting his cold justice!</p>
<p>If you have Disney+, you can also unlock a complimentary Disney+ inspired Daredevil costume, offered exclusively for a limited time from October 10, 2025 to January 8, 2026. You can learn more about this at <a href="http://disneyplus.com/perks">disneyplus.com/perks</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside Daredevil, the biggest change to the game is the much-needed addition of cross-progression. That means that no matter where you play, you can carry on working on the same characters and season pass. That said, it’s only going to be open to a small number of players through 4.5 as this feature is tested, with the expectation that cross-progression will unlock for all players alongside Season 5.0. Rank and leaderboard progression will stay separate for each platform, which I suppose will ease any questions of those keyboard and mouse players butting up against console controllers.</p>

<p>Finally, this update also brings another round of Team-Up Ability adjustments such as removing Ragnarok Rebirth (Hela – Thor) and taking Namor out of Gamma Charge (Hulk – Namor/Black Panther). Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor). Next, there will be a special Halloween event and themed costumes so players can celebrate this mysterious and lively season together, and there’s also a mystery new mode coming, which we’ll have to wait until the 17th of October to find out more about.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has announced a major shakeup of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, bringing more games to players across its four versions, including the addition of Ubisoft+ to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but with the top tier getting a staggering, frankly ridiculous 50% price increase because of this.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has long been the go-to tier for Game Pass, giving access to a library of games, Day One access to a bunch of new releases (including all first party games), cloud game streaming, and online console multiplayer. Now, Microsoft is guaranteeing at least 75 day one games will be added each year, and the addition of Ubisoft+ Classic and Fortnite Crew.</p>



<p>The price of Game Pass Ultimate has crept up in the last few years, and has stood at $19.99 and £14.99 per month since last summer. Now, though, the price is going up by 50% to $29.99 and £22.99 per month.</p>
<p>That’s justified by the Fortnite Crew addition, which is valued at $12 a month as it gives you the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1000 V Bucks each month, and the Ubisoft+ Classics library, which is valued at $8 per month. It’s starting to sound a bit like cable TV or Sky Sports, where you pay through the nose for a huge package of channels, even if you only really want the one thing.</p>

<p>This now puts a massive premium on Game Pass Ultimate and, while there’s additions and more promises, it feels like Microsoft is readjusting the business model in a way to compensate for “lost” revenue from first party game sales. If you see no value from Fortnite Crew or Ubisoft+, then this is just a huge price increase.</p>
<p>The other way to get day one games, in a more limited fashion, is with PC Game Pass. This is only usable with Windows PC – and with the upcoming Ally X handheld – and is going up from $11.99 / £9.99 to $16.49 &nbsp;/ £13.49. The only change here is the addition of Ubisoft+, getting it for $4.50 / £3.50.</p>
<p>Game Pass Standard has now been rebranded as Game Pass Premium, thankfully holding onto the same $14.99 / £10.99 price point. This is actually just becoming a better deal, as while you don’t have day one games, you will get Xbox published games added within a year of launch, and there is now priority cloud gaming for the Game Pass Premium library and for select games that you own.</p>
<p>The runt of the litter remains Game Pass Essential, which replaced Xbox Live Gold a good while ago. Sticking with $9.99 / £6.99 per month (and I believe still with a 12 month purchase possible) this is required for online gaming, and includes a much smaller selection of games. That’s been doubled now, from 25+ to 50+ games, and you can now access cloud gaming.</p>
<p>All of this comes down to how you use Game Pass to consume games. Do you like the additions to Game Pass Ultimate, or would you be reconsidering your subscription at this price point?</p>
