		<p>We love a good MOBA here at TSA Towers. Heck, we probably like the odd bad one too. One of the latest and greatest entries in the mega-popular genre is SMITE 2, the sequel to Titan Forge Games breakout hit. While it’s currently rumbling through an open beta launch, the team are adding new content virtually daily, getting it ready for its full launch, with the latest addition being a returning new god in the form of Cabrakan, and the Wandering Market, a bazaar where players can spend their hard-earned – or potentially hard-bought – Coins on new skins for their favourite characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 Free-to-Play Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTbb9B3UinQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Everything was announced at this past weekend’s SMITE 2 Founders Series event in Las Vegas. The Wandering Market will provide a rotating store for all players to access for free, with additional cosmetic items available via the paid, Premium Collection.</p>
<p>Players will be able to earn Coins to spend in the Wandering Market by completing quests and gaining XP each day. All those lovely Coins will be spendable across the various different collections released in the Wandering Market, so players will be able to save them up for future storefronts/sales as they play, and spend them whenever the mood takes them.</p>
<p>In turn, they shadow-dropped player-favourite Cabrakan into the sequel, delighting many long-term fans. Cabrakan, the destroyer of mountains, represents the Mayan Pantheon of Gods and uses earthquakes to disrupt and crowd control the opposition. We can’t wait to go hands on with him now he’s arrived.</p>

<p>While all this lovely information dropped, they also played a spot of competitive SMITE 2, with the first Founders Series Champions being crowned in Las Vegas when ‘Team Name but with 5 Ms’ beat Team Risk 3-2 in the finals, with BennyQ being crowned MVP. </p>

		<p>Unknown 9 Awakening has been deemed a failure by development studio Reflector, and plans to expand the series with more games, along with other multimedia ventures, have been cancelled. This news also means that staff at Reflector are going to be let go as the studio looks to move to a single project future, with back office staff being affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unknown 9: Awakening –&nbsp; Cinematic Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpO-jUWtm6E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Herve Hoerdt, CEO of Reflector Entertainment, said,<em> “Today, I informed our teams the decision to not greenlight further work on a future project that was in conceptualization phase and thus terminating this development line. Continuing the project would not have been sustainable for the future of the studio. Regrettably, this also means that there will be redundancies following the decision.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio’s ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe. The performance of the release didn’t come near the company expectations, after numerous timeline adjustments and investments, both financially and other, and didn’t warrant any further exploration in this universe.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, this also affects back office staff, bringing the support teams in line with the single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future. Where possible, staff will be assigned to this project, based on an existing Bandai Namco IP, which is shaping up very well.</em></p>

<p><em>Reflector Entertainment will be providing adequate severance packages, extended health benefits for affected staff and families, continued access to emotional, mental health and counselling services and finally, proactive career planning support to set them up for future success. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe will continue investing on creating Western content for global audiences, in line with the Group’s vision.”</em></p>

<p>In our review for Unknown 9: Awakening, Nic said, <em>“I really wanted to write about the positives of featuring more cultures in this genre, and about how cool it is to have a famous actor play the protagonist, but sadly the gameplay gets in the way of anything interesting. Unknown 9: Awakening is just a bunch of gaming tropes loosely tied together with boring and uninspired NPCs lazily lurching from set piece to set piece, as the poorly designed game creaks and groans under the weight of expectation.”</em></p>
