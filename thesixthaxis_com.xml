		<p>It’s an exciting time to be a fan of Grasshopper Manufacture. With nearly three decades of bewildering punk-personified video games, the studio doesn’t seem to be slowing down at all. The team has spent the last few years celebrating their greatest hits, with the hotly anticipated finale <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a> and a sharp remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadows-of-the-damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>. Now, sights are set on new horizons, new worlds, and a new hero with the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a>.</p>
<p>For all the change that Grasshopper Manufacture has gone through over the years, the unorthodox and endlessly inventive vision of studio head Suda51 has seemingly never wavered. We jumped at the chance to sit down with him and check in on how he’s feeling about his upcoming game, and reflect on some of his favourite projects, collaborators, and giant robot anime.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;Well it’s really awesome to be talking to you guys – especially right before Romeo Is a Dead Man, a new game of yours is launching. How are you feeling about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> We’re really happy to be talking to you right now too, and thanks a lot for, you know, for covering us.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like, ‘Wow, it’s really, actually, finally coming out,’ you know? We’ve been really busy. We’re doing this promotional tour right now, we’re also still making final tweaks on everything, making sure everything’s in line. So it’s been really busy and pretty exhausting, but it’s also just super exciting, again, to finally have the game come out!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you guys have been putting a lot of work in – Romeo Is a Dead Man looks incredible. It’s definitely the most high-fidelity, graphically detailed game that Grasshopper Manufacture has made up to this point. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Wow, thank you.</p>
<div id="attachment_468410"><p id="caption-attachment-468410">Romeo Is a Dead Man features a more traditional “AAA” art style to previous Grasshopper games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Was there a specific reason you guys wanted to go for that AAA graphic style for this game, instead of a more stylized or simplified style?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Well, when development really first started kind of getting going, I spoke with our art director, Tanawaki-san [<strong>Kunihiko Taniwaki],</strong> and he had the opinion that this time, we should go with not exactly a photo-realistic style, but more realistic graphics in general. More high-quality graphics, instead of, like, creating a whole new style of art and visuals just for this game.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is, obviously, it takes a lot of time and brain power and creativity to come up with a whole new style. The other thing is, when you’ve got a whole studio full of people working on the same game, it takes a lot of time and effort to everybody on the same page and get everyone to really understand ‘OK, so this is what everything’s supposed to look like. This is how I should make this.’</p>
<p>That was part of the reason there – it would just take a lot of time, it would take a lot of effort. And also, we kind of just wanted to see what we could do making more high-quality, more realistic graphics than we were used to doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – In the game, Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent, and it’s the first time Grasshopper Manufacture has made a game about being on that side of the law since The Silver Case and 25th Ward. </strong><strong>Why make a game about an interstellar FBI agent instead of, for example, a demon hunter or assassins?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> This is kind of a weird way to start off the answer to this question, but when I first came up with the idea for the story and the character, as you could probably tell by playing the game, I was mainly inspired by Back to the Future and Rick &amp; Morty. Not only the space-time travel stuff but the relationships and everything.</p>
<p>So when I started thinking about what kind of main character I was going to make, to be honest, even I’m not sure of the <em>exact </em>reason why I decided this, but I thought ‘OK, this time I want to basically portray just a regular young dude, and write the story of how he kind of grows and develops into a grown man. And, you know, gets tough and stronger and really fulfils his own potential and stuff.’</p>
<p>Then came the ideas of him getting the special helmet and becoming Deadman and having to overcome all kinds of challenges and stuff. But yeah, I didn’t really set out with the idea of ‘OK, this time I’m going to go against the grain of Grasshopper titles – I’m going to make the guy somebody on <em>this </em>side of the law!’&nbsp;It just sort of happened, to be honest, and I don’t really have a specific reason why.</p>
<div id="attachment_468411"><p id="caption-attachment-468411">Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting that you talk about the idea for the character kind of being about wanting to see a young man become stronger and grow. It feels like that’s a little different than a lot of your previous characters, where they start already kind of being these rough, mean, weird dudes. Was there a reason why that kind of story really appealed to you this time for Romeo Is a Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Up ‘til now, like you said, there’s been a lot of characters who are kind of the exact opposite. For example, Travis Touchdown – you got this guy who, he’s a grown man, but pretty immature and kind of screwed up and, you know, he’s got a pension for being a bit rough and violent.</p>
<p>I think it might have been subconscious – or might have actually been a little bit of a conscious decision and I just didn’t really notice until recently – but I think part of me was probably like, since I’ve been working on characters particularly like Travis Touchdown for so long, I think maybe this time I’m going to go the other way and have the character start out <em>not </em>fully developed yet. And also, you know, not be this kind of… funky asshole, I guess you could say. I think that probably did, at least on a subconscious level, influence my decision to start with this sort of character in this sort of story and how he was portrayed.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve talked in the past about how your team works collaboratively to share ideas and build them together. Is there an idea that made it into the final version of Romeo Is a Dead Man that surprised you? Like something you didn’t come up with yourself at all, or something you would have never thought of or expected to work in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Uhh… oh, there’s a part of the game called [Deadgear Cannonball], where you can use it to power up Romeo and the stuff he can do. And at the beginning [of development], one of the staff members said ‘Hey, I want to put this type of mini-game thing in the game, it’ll become like a Pac-Man style thing, and you just power up, and this is how it would work.’</p>
<p>When they explained it, I was kind of like ‘What the hell are you talking about, like why…’ and they were like, ‘No, I really want to do this, we should try this out.’ And then, you know, it got put in the game, and when we started the debugging phase, bit by bit, I tried it out and I was like ‘Yeah…I still don’t really get it. Like, again, what is this Pac-Man rip-off thing? What’s this really even for?’</p>
<p>But then, when development progressed even further and it got to the point were we could play through the game linearly, I started realising not only does it fit in really well and it kind of flows really well with the rest of the game, but it’s actually a really important element in the game. Yeah, that was a really good idea. I’m really glad we put that in.</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven’t told that person that! [Laughs]
</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GhM Direct 30 Seconds: Ep. 14 - Deadgear Cannonball" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6v8ncSULh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TSA – In Romeo Is A Dead Man, and a few other Grasshopper Games, you’re credited as “SUDA51” for the Directing and the Story, but Producer gets credited to your real name, Goichi Suda. Why the distinction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] I feel like Suda51 is more connected to the creative side of things, and naming wise it kind of fits better with that. But using my real name, you know, Goichi Suda, that sounds a bit more serious, like, you know, CEO-ish, than just Suda51. Like a dude wearing a suit with, like, a proper tie and everything. And so I thought it might be best to kind of split the way I use my names in that way.</p>
<p>Also, to be honest, I’m also just trying to look cool.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You could look cool wearing the leather jacket and the necktie. Could be interesting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Sounds like a pretty bitchin’ style. I might try it out.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know that your original vision for Shadows of the Damned ended up spawning multiple drafts, and some of those drafts inspired later works like Kurayami Dance and Black Knight Sword. Did any ideas from those drafts end up inspiring Romeo Is A Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Nothing from Shadows of the Damned, no. All the different drafts that got made for Shadows of the Damned either just got trashed, or got canned, or turned into something else. But none of them had anything to do with Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – The last few games from Grasshopper Manufacturer almost feel like Avengers movies with how many returning characters there are. You’ve brought back characters from Let it Die, Killer 7, Shadows of the Damned, and even your short story ‘Aka to Ao to Midori to’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Woah, haha. You did thorough research!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;For Romeo Is a Dead Man, did you have any characters you’ve wanted to bring back, but couldn’t?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Actually, yeah: Fleming from Shadows of the Damned. I believe it was the seventh draft, maybe, that I had him actually appear as one of the bosses in the game. It’s really unfortunate, but things changed and he ended up not being able to make it. It’s a shame.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to put Fleming in No More Heroes 3, as well. That also, as you know, ended up not working out. But in my mind, Fleming is this character that I want to have battle all these other characters in my other games and stuff. I just really don’t want him to be a one-off thing – I want to use him again, you know?</p>
<p>And this is just, like, talking out of my ass here, but if someday, like 20 years from now or something, if we end up doing like a remake of No More Heroes 3, then I’m hoping to be able to kind of shoehorn him in there.</p>
<p>But I really do want to see him head into battle against a lot of the other characters that I make. Actually, for both Romeo Is a Dead Man and No More Heroes 3, it got so far, to the point where I actually wrote the scenario with Fleming in it – both with Romeo and with Travis in the two different games. Again, unfortunately, it just ended up not working out, so, what are you going to do? But it wasn’t just kind of like a one-off idea that I had and said ‘oh no, never mind.’ I actually did put the effort into it.</p>
<div id="attachment_468409"><p id="caption-attachment-468409">Fleming from Shadows of the Damned never quite made it into later games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – What was the reason for Fleming not making it, in that case? Was it kind of just that creatively the draft and your vision for the game went in a different direction where it didn’t make sense to have him there for Romeo Is A Dead Man? Or was it some sort of outside reason?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It’s actually a really simple reason, to be honest. Just scheduling reasons. We have to deal with both scheduling, and someone’s got to pay for this stuff too. When it came down to it, we were like, ‘Okay, we’re gonna end up going way over schedule on this. We have to tweak some stuff, we’re gonna have to cut some stuff.’</p>
<p>And honestly, just one of the parts that happened to be easiest to cut without screwing up other parts of the game would have been the Fleming part. So he got cut because of that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve regularly collaborated with surprising multimedia artists for your games, like Boneface for Travis Strikes Again or AC-BU for the Velvet Chair Girl scenes in No More Heroes 3. How do you decide when to bring in outside artists like this to collab with, and how do you pick them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It really just comes down to the artist, and the art they make, and whether I dig it, and whether I feel like it’d be something that would be a good fit. For example, Boneface, I’ve been aware of his art, I’ve seen it online and in different places and just thought it looked really cool, and reached out and said ‘Hey, would you like to maybe do something with us for this game series that I got going here?’</p>
<p>For AC-BU, I happen to know a guy who had connections with them, and went through with the director named Mizuno and ended up being able to talk to them directly and show them what we were trying to do and the kind of thing we were trying to achieve. And, also, I’ve seen the stuff that they’ve done before, and just thought it was really cool and thought ‘okay, considering what it is we’re trying to achieve now, considering the stuff that these people are obviously able to do – I think this would be a pretty good fit, so let’s try and work it out.’</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’ll be that somebody introduces me to these people and I’ll check their stuff out and be like ‘Oh, yeah, that’s somebody I’d like to work with.’ And sometimes it’ll be somebody that I’ve kind of found on my own and just kind of reached out to on my own and been like ‘Oh, hey, this is who I am. You want to work together?’</p>
<p>But yeah, as far as how I choose the different artists to work with and why? It’s pretty much sort of a case-by-case.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Are there any artists you’d like to collaborate with for the next Grasshopper Manufacture game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> I don’t really have a concrete idea yet for ‘This is the person I want to work with for our next game!’ or ‘This is exactly what our next game is going to be!’. But we do have a couple projects that we’re sort of <em>not</em> working on, as in actually developing, but planning and fleshing out the ideas for and everything. We have a couple of those in the works and I do have a couple ideas for those. Like if we really are going to do this project, then <em>this </em>is somebody that I’d like to work with for this particular one.</p>
<p>Actually, there is one guy that I just thought of who I’d like to work with a little more, in a much more full capacity, you could say. He’s a manga artist name Asano Inio, he did the art for Midori Midorikawa and Kamui in No More Heroes 3. Not only did I really like the art that he did for that game, but I’ve seen the manga he does, I’ve seen the art he does before, and I think it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Instead of just having him be sort of like a guest artist or guest creator on a game, I’d really like to get into a whole game with this guy, do like an actual collaboration where instead of just doing one or two characters, this is the guy who’s doing a whole lot more art for the game. I’d love to do some sort of collaboration with him at some point.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I’m a big fan of that author. He did that manga, Dead Dead Demon’s Dededede Destruction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Yeah! That one! Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – One of my favorite games of yours is Let It Die, and it’s also the only console game you’ve worked on with online interactions, where you send NPC hunters from your game to other player’s worlds to hunt them. Is there a reason you haven’t returned to that online style for your games since?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> To be honest, as far as Let It Die goes, it’s known to be a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but I don’t really consider that to be the case.</p>
<p>Technically, I did participate, and some of us did participate in development, but it was a GungHo game, basically. And, you know, the online stuff is because GungHo is basically an online game company.</p>
<p>I consider Let It Die to be, not necessarily a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but a Supertrick Games game. They’re the ones who did most development. So yeah, the online elements aren’t exactly our thing, that’s much more of a GungHo thing. Nothing wrong with that – it’s just not really something that we’re into, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well now I feel embarrassed for saying it’s one of my favorites from you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Don’t worry, it’s cool, technically we were involved in the development and stuff! So it’s not wrong, don’t worry about it.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – Well, <em>another</em> one of my favorites from Grasshopper Manufacture is Travis Strikes Again, and it felt like an incredibly personal video game, where so many of the stories and characters seemed to be reflections of your own history in the world of game development. Did you face any challenges making that game and writing it the way you did?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> For Travis Strikes Again, I wouldn’t say that it was hard or difficult to write the characters and write them the way that I did. It definitely felt different than the way it usually does to write characters. […]
</p><p>Travis Strikes Again was actually done around the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper Manufacture being established, so we wanted to do something special for that, and we got a lot of leeway from companies – for example at Capcom, they were like ‘OK, well seeing as how it’s their 20th anniversary and stuff, you can use stuff from Killer 7,’ and things like this.</p>
<p>I did include a lot of characters that, for most players, probably seemed to be new characters, and a lot of familiar characters from previous games. But the thing is, a lot of the characters that people hadn’t seen before, they weren’t made necessarily for Travis Strikes Again – they were characters that I’d come up with either for other games that ended up not making it into that game, […] or the game itself ended up getting canned for some reason, or just ended up never coming to fruition.</p>

<p>So a lot of the story and the characters that I wrote for Travis Strikes Again, it was almost an elegy to these characters who, you know, they… not necessarily died. I mean, most of them in the game died, but you know, they were kind of stuck in this limbo. By finally being able to get them out there and put them in the game, I was kind of trying to help them to finally just ascend and finally move on, you know what I mean? And not just for the characters, but for myself as well.</p>
<p>So, I did put a lot of my older ideas and past ideas and characters into the game. Again, that was also partly because it was for the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper. I personally wanted to do something special for this game. That’s why you see so many things that kind of feel like they come out of left field. Sometimes they feel a little bit more natural, but they’re clearly, you know, ‘Oh this is this guy from that other game!’</p>
<p>And again, a lot of the stuff that people assumed were new were actually, you know, they may have showed up, or almost showed up in 1, 2, 3, 4 past games, but ended up not. So, yeah, Travis Strikes Again, it was a big sort of jumble of these characters, and me not only trying to help these characters kind of move on and finally, you know, get what I felt they deserved, but also sort of letting myself kind of let them go. Finally being able to say, okay, I was finally able to put them out there. I’ve done for them what I can have done for them, what I owe them. This is their elegy.</p>
<p>That’s kind of what Travis Strikes Again was like writing, for me.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know batting centers are important to you, so important you made sure to include one in The Silver Case. When you’re travelling abroad for work, is there a place you go to that feels like the overseas version of going to the batting center to be alone with your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, I’m kind of too scared to like, actually go out on my own when I’m overseas to like, find a place where I can just kind of be alone with my thoughts and stuff. That would mean that I have to go out all by myself like a big boy and, you know, find some place to chill and everything. And I can’t really do that.</p>
<p>So, I’d probably say my hotel room. [laughs] I guess that would be my overseas batting center.</p>
<div id="attachment_333568"><p id="caption-attachment-333568">Uh, here’s a screenshot from RBI Baseball 19, which we have handy…</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – I also know that bars and beer have been important to you for a long time, no matter where you are in the world. What is it about drinking at ‘bar plastic model’ in Golden Gai, hunting for Blue Moon when you’re overseas, and going to your old “third meeting room” Motsuyaki Kawakami that you enjoy the most?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpreter</strong> <strong>–</strong> I mean, have you had beer before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – [Laughs] I have had beer before. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Have you been to ‘bar plastic model’ before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Yeah actually, I was in Japan two years ago and went!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong>&nbsp; To me, it’s kind of like a present to myself, kind of like a reward to myself. I don’t know how people outside of Japan feel about this, but to a lot of Japanese people, that’s kind of what having a beer after work is. So you finished a day, a long day of hard work, and ‘OK, I’m going to reward myself with beer.’ You know?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during Corona I just kind of stopped drinking that much and kind of stopped being able to. Partly because I stopped being able to go out to drink so much, I also stopped being able to drink so much at all. […] I get wasted a lot easier than I used to. So instead of staying out having a bunch of drinks, yeah, usually I just keep it to like one beer or so and that’s enough. I’m like ‘OK, yeah, that was some good work I did today. Just pound one back and that’s cool.’</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you’re a big fan of beer because you called it Corona instead of Covid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] that’s just what it’s called in Japan, but that’s a good one!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What haven’t I asked that you would like to talk about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Hmmmm, I’m not sure. Let’s see… have you beaten the game yet?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Not yet! I’m on the second boss right now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Ahhh, okay. When you beat it, there’s gonna be a lot of questions you want to ask, and a lot of things i want to talk about. So let’s save those, and after you beat it let’s talk again.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Alright, I’ll beat it, and we’ll talk about that, and we’ll talk about Char’s Counterattack. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh, have you seen GQuuuuuuX? [Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX]
</p><div id="attachment_468407"><p id="caption-attachment-468407">Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I <em>loved</em> GQuuuuuuX. </strong><strong>I have the model kit for the GFreD mobile suit!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh. Nice, nice. I was waiting for ‘How much influence did GQuuuuuuX have on Romeo Is a Dead Man?’ – that’s one question that I was hoping you’d ask.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well, I definitely wanted to talk about anime. I’d love to know what you thought about GQuuuuuuX, being such a big fan of the original Char story. Did you like GQuuuuuuX?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> There’s one part of the game where it’s really clear that this part was really, really inspired heavily by GQuuuuuuX. So, yeah, once you’ve cleared the game, once you got to that part, let’s talk about that again!</p>

		<p>Revisiting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2026 is an experience as full of delights and surprises as it was in 2023. NIntendo absolutely knocked it out of the park with their trippy, transformative levels that just brought so much playfulness back to the 2D platformer… but that was paired with a fairly by-the-numbers multiplayer.</p>
<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> + Meetup in Bellabel Park improves on this in some ways, but sticks to that classic Nintendo stubbornness in others.</p>
<p><iframe title="More fun is coming to the Flower Kingdom March 26th! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LgNT3oIw6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Meetup in Bellabel Park is all in on multiplayer shenanigans, with multiple areas devoted to different ways to play. Local multiplayer is still the only way to actually share a level together, while any kind of online multiplayer turns everyone into ghosts, so you’re not really playing together. The sneaky way out of this tangle is that Switch 2 has GameShare to let you stream the game to another console, which can be local or via online GameChat. It’s not the same as native online multiplayer (the resolution is lower and there’s a big info bar shrinking the screen), but it will have to do.</p>


<p>So, that’s how you can play the new Local Multiplayer Plaza with people outside of your postcode, but what is it? There’s 17 different stages here, with some co-operative and others competitive, all for up to four players, and all putting a much more inventive spin on the core 2D plaforming.</p>
<p>Phanto Tag takes Prop Hunt and the classic game of Tag and puts them in a blender, as masked players need to track, chase and catch the others within a single screen arena. They can run, of course, but they will also need to hide by disguising themselves as items and props, trying to make use of the shifting objects and shading of the screen. It’s a good bit of competitive fun.</p>
<p>On the complete opposite end of the scale, another stage invokes the spirit of the Wii U Gamepad and New Super Mario Bros. U, tasking some players with drawing donut block platforms across the screen so that others can make it through the level, and also using them to solve puzzles. It’s a great use of the returning idea, not least because you can use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode to draw the platforms.</p>

<p>Then there’s Bob-omb Relay, where you need to throw the bomb back and forth when prompted, but also have to get it into the correct player’s hands, or you could each be trying to feed your own Baby Yoshi the apples that spawn all over the screen through a level, while having to deal with the Baby Yoshi getting bigger and fatter and slowing you down.</p>
<p>After sampling a couple of those levels, we then ran around the Bellabel hub to reach the Game Room Plaza, and the six attractions for up to 12 players online (or up to 8 players with local wireless). These take a simple ideas and Wonder Flower effects, like riding on a Propeller Flower or hanging onto a giant bouncy ball, and spin them into competitive modes where you’ll race as ghosts through to the finish. They’re simple fun, but deceptively so. Bouncing the ball and needing to hit the right angled surfaces to bounce yourself forward faster, and avoid the back-tilted ones that would sap all your momentum is something I didn’t quite master, but the shmup-like obstacle dodging of the Propeller Flower races? I was pretty good at those!</p>

<p>There’s more to this expansion and update that we didn’t delve into, such as the Co-Star Luma, using the Assist modes, or how the Koopalings have sprinkled new challenges through the Flower Kingdom of the main game, but if you were wanting just a little bit more spark to the multiplayer of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, then you might want to schedule your meetup… in Bellabel Park.</p>

		<p>It’s easy to think of Nintendo as this unstoppable family-friendly gaming juggernaut, given their most recent track record, but for every golden patch, there’s been struggles and ill-fated projects. The Wii U is the most recent example, and beloved as the GameCube is, it still ended up in third place in its generation. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtual-boy">Virtual Boy</a>, though, was on a whole other level, a critical and commercial flop that barely lasted a year.</p>
<p>Perfect, then, for a revival within the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a> + Expansion Pack game library for both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with a pricey plastic recreation (or cardboard equivalent) needed in order to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Introducing games and features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvskekdB9t4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Virtual Boy accessory looks utterly authentic to the original –&nbsp;having only ever been released in Japan and the Americas, it’s sadly not a console I’ve seen in the flesh. It’s a chunky plastic red and black visor mounted onto a pair of angled legs at a fixed height. Where the original had a bespoke red LED display that sought to balance cost, price and usability, that’s now substituted out for a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 to provide the screen, which is then passed through lenses and a red light filter to recreate the original’s stereoscopic effect. The cardboard edition will likely have a lot in common with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/11/labo-vr-is-the-most-creative-use-of-virtual-reality-yet/">the Labo VR kit</a>, from Nintendo’s 2019 cardboard experiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_468403"><p id="caption-attachment-468403">The original Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED and Switch 2 can all be used to provide the screen for the Virtual Boy accessory.</p>
</div>
<p>While we’re much more familiar with VR headsets since 2016, with evangelists for the tech still happily strapping screens to their heads for the latest experiences (or just more Beat Saber), the mid-90s were much, much more cautious. There’s the spectre of eye-strain and headaches that have stuck in the Virtual Boy’s legacy, but I wonder how much of that was down to the way you have to use the headset.</p>
<p>It comes with a set of fixed legs to position the Virtual Boy on a table, and you then have to place your face into the headset. You can’t adjust the height of the headset, though, only tilt it back and forth, so for me that meant leaning forward and arching my back to view inside, which is bound to give you a bad back after too long playing like this. I know I’d be stacking this on boxes and thick textbooks if playing at home. Why didn’t Nintendo take this opportunity to fix this?</p>
<div id="attachment_468398"><p id="caption-attachment-468398">I wish I’d brought a stack of books to preview the Virtual Boy accessory.</p></div>
<p>The other issue is that this means your view is constantly moving when using it, and through the lenses, that can lead to shifting focus and sharpness through the lenses. A big part of modern VR is getting the headset mounted in the sweet spot and then having it stay there, and this can’t manage the same.</p>
<p>All of the Virtual Boy games will be wrapped up in the familiar Switch Online classic game library interface and features, though these are all rendered in red and black, just like the games themselves. You can pause the game at any time to check the controls, set a new suspend point, swap back and forth between games at will – it’s just a solid and to the point emulation wrapper at this point.</p>
<div id="attachment_468399"><p id="caption-attachment-468399">Virtual Boy Wario Land has some nicely layered environments and pioneered the multi-plane 2D platformer trope.</p></div>
<p>So what of the games? Naturally the Virtual Boy’s library is rather small, and seven of these games will appear on day one. Virtual Boy Wario Land is immediately the main attraction, launching a year after his Game Boy game and giving a similar feeling platforming experience. Wario is more brutish in his actions, charging into enemies and slamming into breakable objects, and the levels are more open-ended here as you explore an underground cave. What’s rather nice is the 3D depth to the parallax effect, and I was surprised at how smoothly things could move along the Z-axis of my view. Things like spiked balls swinging in and out of the screen, which you need to dodge with Wario. It’s pretty neat and likely the first game most people will play.</p>
<p>I also gave a few other games a quick go, including Teleroboxer. It’s a fairly straightforward Punch Out! style game, though pitting you against robot boxers, made of layered parallax elements, giving a simple but effective 3D depth as the fists come out towards you. Galactic Pinball, meanwhile, is exactly what you expect from a pinball game, but it’s in a low resolution 3D, making the distant parts of the table feel really rather distant and with a ball that moves rather slowly.</p>
<div id="attachment_468402"><p id="caption-attachment-468402">Teleroboxer layers sprites to create your robotic adversaries.</p></div>
<p>The last title I dipped into with my hands on time was Red Alarm, a 3D rail shooter in the vein of Star Fox, but with a wire-frame 3D instead of shaded surfaces (which would be very difficult to manage with a monochrome screen). The additional quirk was a lack of occlusion, so you can see enemies clearly through the obstacles and walls you fly past.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Virtual Boy library will also feature 3D Tetris, Golf and the formerly Japan exclusive The Mansion of Innsmouth, coming to the West for the first time. A further nine games are then set to release through the rest of 2026, including the previously unreleased titles D-Hopper and Zero Racers. There’s also the upcoming feature to switch from red-only pixel art and change the graphics colour to yellow, green, white and potentially other colours. I really think that an off-white might end up being the best visual colour, balancing brightness with the clarity of a Game Boy Pocket (which was able to do away with the green tint of the original Game Boy screen). I’m also rather curious to see whether the Switch OLED provides a better screen for the Virtual Boy accessory than the LCD-based Switch 2.</p>
<div id="attachment_468401"><p id="caption-attachment-468401">This sure is a pinball game, and it looks 3D…</p></div>
<p>The Virtual Boy accessory and library of games coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is both great to see and pretty baffling. It’s great to see Nintendo revisit such a fleeting console and revive and preserve another facet of their legacy like this, but it’s baffling that they haven’t made an effort to tweak the design even slightly to make it more adjustable and comfortable. And it also just leaves me wondering, why didn’t they port these games to Nintendo 3DS? Surely that</p>
