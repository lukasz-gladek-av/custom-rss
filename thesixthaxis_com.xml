<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">Death Stranding PC review</a>, which came in 2020. For this release, Miguel said: “It’s a story well worth revisiting or experiencing for the first time on PC. The pacing of the game can certainly drag to a screeching halt through the middle, but with boosted frame rate and crisper visuals, you’ll likely be too mesmerised by the hauntingly gorgeous world of Hideo Kojima’s latest masterpiece to even care about the uneven story beats.”</p>
