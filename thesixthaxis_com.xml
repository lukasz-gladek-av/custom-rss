		<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have launched the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-but-theres-a-bonus-bit-of-season-1-to-fill-the-gap/">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 2, bringing a new map, reams of new cosmetics and unlocks through the Battle Pass, and promise of limited-time events and match effects. </p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Intro Cinematic" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_Ih_1bWR3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new map is a large scale battle set around a German airbase, catering to all combat sizes and the main game modes of Conquest, Breakthrough and Escalation, and featuring both land vehicles and helicopters. It’s another pleasing step towards the kind of large scale maps that were largely missing for Battlefield 6’s launch.</p>
<p>It’s the first of two maps that will be included in Battlefield Season 2, when fans have been clamouring for more variety. Why aren’t they making more, when that’s what people want?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r87tes/battlefield_studios_says_they_dont_have_the_time/">DICE’s Producer Alexia Christofi says</a> “In terms of cadence, we would love to create way more maps. But we’re just trying to kind of bring things to players as we can and as quickly as we can build them.”</p>
<p>They’re balancing map making with running limited time events, in other words. This will see a limited time mode added to multiplayer and REDSEC in season 2 with the VL-7 Strike meaning that psychoactive smoke will drop onto the map, forcing you to quickly put on a gas mask and manage your filters to avoid being affected. The battle royale map has been modified with smoke engulfing Fort Lyndon, and the Gauntlet mode has returned, also with this smoke affecting the fights.</p>


<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Battlefield 6 Update 1.2.1.0 and Season 2’s launch:</p>
<p><strong>New Map: Contaminated</strong></p>
<p>A large-scale European mountainside battlefield set around a strategic German airbase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports all combat sizes</li>
<li>Includes land vehicles and helicopters</li>
<li>Available across Conquest, Breakthrough, Escalation, Squad Death Match, and Strikepoint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Limited-Time Modes</strong></p>
<p>Season 2 introduces a set of limited-time experiences built around VL-7, a new psychoactive smoke weapon spreading across multiple battlefields. As contaminated zones emerge, squads must adapt their tactics, manage masks and filters, and fight for control in increasingly hostile environments across multiplayer, Battle Royale, and Gauntlet.</p>
<p><strong>VL-7 Strike:</strong> A limited-time mode where the psychoactive smoke VL-7 spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must use masks and manage their filters carefully, as running out will leave them exposed to VL-7’s disorienting effects.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Royale – Synthesis:</strong> Smoke engulfs Fort Lyndon, transforming the battleground. Fight and loot within contaminated zones while securing masks and filters to survive the smoke’s effects.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet: Altered State:</strong> Gauntlet returns with a new twist. Squads compete in a knockout-style elimination format while navigating psychoactive smoke and racing to complete missions under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>New Vehicle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AH-6 Little Bird:</strong> The iconic attack helicopter returns for NATO forces, offering high mobility and lethal firepower in skilled hands.</li>

<li><strong>GRT-CPS:</strong> A semi-automatic designated marksman rifle designed for mid- to long-range engagements, featuring a high-capacity magazine for sustained fire.</li>
<li><strong>VCR-2:</strong> A short-range assault rifle with a rapid rate of fire, built for intense close-quarters combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Gadgets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9K38 IGLA:</strong> A lock-on, anti-air missile launcher that requires active guidance from engineers to stay on target. Provides&nbsp; superior missile maneuverability to adept users.</li>
<li><strong>HTI-Mk2:</strong> A short- to medium-range Recon device that can detect and reveal enemy gadgets, overload recon drones, and neutralise incoming rockets.</li>
<li><strong>Protective Mask:</strong> Essential equipment for contaminated zones, protecting players from psychoactive smoke. Additional filters can be acquired and equipped to extend protection time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Pass &amp; Progression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Season 2 Battle Pass:</strong> Instantly unlock 6 rewards and progress through 4 themed paths featuring new hardware, weapon packages, soldier skins, XP boosts, and more. Complete all paths to unlock the Ultimate Path.</li>
<li><strong>BF Pro:</strong> In addition to the regular Battle Pass, BF Pro includes 6 instant unlocks, 25 tier skips, BF Radio, Portal Server Hosting, and access to an exclusive bonus path with additional tactical rewards</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT</strong></p>
<p>As part of Update <a href="http://1.2.1.0/">1.2.1.0</a>, we’ve made improvements to both how recoil behaves at a system level and how recoil is used to balance automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Since launch, recoil compensation could feel inconsistent in certain situations. In some cases, the amount of aim input required to counter recoil did not reliably match the recoil being applied, which could make weapons feel harder to control than expected. While improvements were made during Season 1 to reduce the most extreme cases, some inconsistency could still be noticeable during regular gameplay. With this update, recoil compensation has been made fully consistent, ensuring that the aim input required to counter recoil now correctly matches the recoil applied. This results in more predictable and reliable weapon handling.</p>
<p>Separately from this systemic fix, we’ve also made a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons. Recoil is one of the main ways we balance weapons across different engagement distances: higher-damage weapons are intentionally harder to control, while lighter weapons trade raw power for ease of use and consistency. Over time, we saw this balance starting to drift once we looked at how these weapons were actually being used in live matches across common combat ranges.</p>
<p>This tuning pass brings recoil behaviour back in line with each weapon’s intended role. You should expect automatic weapons to feel more consistent and better differentiated across ranges, with higher-impact weapons demanding more control and positioning, while others remain reliable and forgiving in closer engagements.</p>

		<p>Christopher Judge, the actor who has played Kratos in the most recent God of War games, seems to have leaked information about both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a> remakes, and whatever Sony Santa Monica are working on.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"> video</a> seems to show him confirming something we already knew, that TC Carson will be returning to the role of Kratos in the remakes, but he also adds that there will be “new technology and new fighting systems”.</p>


<p>He then goes on to say that “then you will be hearing what we’re doing probably late summer”.&nbsp; He does not specifically say that it’s a new God of War game, but the “we” he refers to is presumably Sony Santa Monica, who have not released a game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a> in 2022.</p>
<p>The video is now longer on the YouTube channel it seems to have been ripped from, and it really does not look like AI, but you can never be 100% sure these days.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Trilogy Remake - Announcement Teaser | PS5 Games" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_tq12WisX8?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In God of War (2005), Kratos serves Ares, the God of War, after pledging himself in desperation during battle. Manipulated by Ares into slaughtering his own wife and daughter, he eventualy ends up killin Ares and taking the title for himself.</p>

<p>The second game has Kratos stripped of all his powers by Zeus, killed, and banished to the underworld. He eventually teams up with the Titans, rewinds time and attacks Mount Olympus. Clearly not learning his lesson from the first time, Zeus then kills him again in the third game.</p>
<p>Judge will not be playing Kratos in the upcoming Amazon TV show, that honour goes to Ryan Hurst&nbsp; who has previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok.&nbsp;</a>Ryan Hurst is best known for playing Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and will be seen on the big screen later this year in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.</p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek games and beginning in Norse mythology, but one would assume they are going to have explain why Kratos is covered in white ash and has giant chains wrapped around his forearms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The stop-motion aesthetics of previous games by two-man dev team Talha and Jack have always been uniquely striking, with 2024’s Judero being the title that really gained critics’ and players’ attention. Judero’s take on Scottish folklore combined the handcrafted art of Jack King-Spooner with the coding prowess of Talha Kaya to produce a title that was brimming with humour and style. The duo followed this up with the fun mining game, Mashina, last year, and are now back with a Kickstarter campaign for a surreal and disturbing horror game called Abide. I had the opportunity to sit down and share a virtual coffee and conversation with the pair to find out more.</p>
<p><iframe title="ABIDE KickStarter Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtqJPwQ4fvg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TSA – Thanks for talking to us. I’m not used to these virtual interviews, but how are you doing?</strong></p>


<p><strong>Talha – </strong>Good, good, very excited, very anxious (all of the things) about our new game.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – How is the Kickstarter going so far?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s tracking very closely with the timelimit. Midway point we were midway, and now 64% through we’re 64% funded so it’s going to be tight. It’s different every time; there tends to be a slight flurry towards the end as people who have wishlisted it will get notifications towards the end ‘hey this is finishing’, but it’s not something I want to bank on or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Is the Kickstarter an all or nothing situation for the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s all or nothing basically. The other options are work on it part-time and get a zero-hour contract job or try getting a publisher but there’s a whole kind of smorgasbord of things that go along with that and a lot of publishers would just not consider this kind of game at all.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – That’s the problem with being actually original in a way. Also some of the more challenging aspects of the game given the current climate with titles like Horses and Vile: Exhumed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>Yeah, with both of those games it’s kind of baffling that they should be deplatformed from marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What’s your background interest in horror, Jack? I see your dissertation was on extreme horror?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It was on Kristeva’s idea of the abject and how it ties to visual media and also lots of Lacanian writing about the cinema screen.</p><p>
[Jack and I went on for quite a while about these psycho-analytical approaches to horror which I’ll spare you here!]
</p><p>I’ve always had this thing about storytelling and horror and what that says about the present culture and how it can be seen in retrospect. Violence was so in vogue with things like Saw and Hostel.&nbsp; Does this media desensitise you? Are people trying to be desensitised?</p>

<p><strong>TSA – That all tracks with the tangible nature of your art and games. It’s uncanny as it’s very unreal but also uses real handmade materials. With Judero I’m constantly moving between appreciating the beauty of the models and being repulsed by some of the more grotesque aspects. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Kickstarter highlights that you’ve consulted with clinical therapists to make sure that the difficult topics you’re including are treated correctly. This speaks to wanting to engage with horror more deeply rather than use it just as an aesthetic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I think this is a conversation to be had, an aspect of shock is the unexpected but there’s another type of shock that Abide is about, like the splash of cold water. The horror of the truth which is getting parsed through some of the conversations I’m having with psychologists who have worked with offenders and people who have been in controversial situations. Sometime being honest to these things can amplify the horror.</p><p>
[Jack and I now went on another long tangent about the history of psychology…]
</p><p>Lots of horror is just big men with knives are scary – oooh but one of the ways that Abide feels so fresh is that it has a really strong metatext that is coming through as I’m researching it and writing it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting to hear that you’re digging deeper than the basic jumpscare tropes of so much horror gaming.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I wouldn’t dismiss the importance of jumpscares though. They are an important tool and can be really interesting in the way they build up with the music and atmosphere etc.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>When it comes to the whole mechanical game design of a horror game there is a lot of stuff that is very animalistic. This whole conversation is making me think that when there is an intellectual base to it than that jumpscare can have more meaning behind it. But when you’re making the game it is just a tool, to keep the player entertained.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;TSA –</strong> <strong>I’m interested in your creative process. Do you make the models etc first or do you have the game outline in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>The game idea comes first and then the artstyle doesn’t necessarily make the game better or worse, it’s just the artstyle. There’s an interpretable element to the art – I mean, with a horror game it’s really fun to make it out of dolls because that’s a trope. Spooky dolls. When you’re making it, everything kind of feeds into itself and becomes part of the creative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>It is trickier to prototype this game because you already need a really well made and decorated house and you need the characters so there is a huge time budget for art and assets.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – This has been a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you both for taking the time to talk to me about all of this. Good luck with the Kickstarter and I can’t wait to get hands on with Abide!</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/abide?ref=discovery&amp;term=abide&amp;total_hits=72&amp;category_id=35">Kickstarter for Abide</a> runs until the 28<sup>th</sup> February with digital copies of the game being available from the £12 pledge. Speaking to Jack and Talha highlights to me just how crucial these kinds of genuine artistic approaches to gaming and horror are in a world that is becoming increasingly commodified and handed over to Generative AI. I would urge you to check out the Kickstarter and pledge if you are able.</p>
