		<p>Ready to get shrunk down and fight some ants again? Those busy bees at Obsidian are doing it again, miniaturising players and setting them loose in the back yard in Grounded 2 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will start off in Game Preview for Xbox Series X|S on 29th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grounded 2 - Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Turns out it’s the exact same kids that have been shrunk, according to the trailer blrub:</p>
<p>Shrunk again, but the world is much larger. In this open-world, single-player or co-op survival adventure, craft weapons and armor, build your base, and traverse the playground on your buggy. But something else is out there—and it hasn’t forgotten you.</p>

<p>The original Grounded was announced and entered Xbox Game Preview back in 2020, one of the first new projects from the recently acquired Obsidian Entertainment. The game is a step away from the company’s traditional RPG fare, a four player co-op survival game that borrows a little from the classic film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids! It gained quite a healthy following with a long string of updates from the company, building up to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/29/grounded-final-update-0-14-27-september-release-date/">&nbsp;its full release two years later in 2022</a>, but was then part of the first wave of PlayStation 5 ports from Xbox in early 2024, which saw it gain a big new following on PlayStation as well.</p>

		<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching on 21st October across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, PlatinumGames and Team Ninja have revealed. it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Official Release Date Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GA70JV2dCMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the first game in more than a decade, with Team Ninja leaning on Platinum Games’ expertise through the likes of Nier:Automata and Bayonetta to push the series forward.</p>
<p>Ryu will return from previous games, but there’s a new playable character of Yakumo, coming from the rival Raven Clan and looking to follow in Hayabusa’s footsteps to become the Master Ninja. The story will return to a futuristic Tokyo which now exists in the shadow of the Dark Dragon’s husk, with a never-ending corrupting rain coming down from it to suggest that it still lives.</p>
<p>The game will feature plenty of fast-paced action, whether it’s navigating the world through wall-running, rail grinding, grappling and more, and through the blistering melee combat.&nbsp;There’s a both a Raven Style and Nué Style that looks to push the series combat forward with two contrasting sets of abilities.</p>
