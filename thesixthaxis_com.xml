		<p>There’s another quirky collaboration for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> players to enjoy, with The Digiverse expanding once again for the free Two Point Museum x Vampire Survivors update, and Update 6.0 in general.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum x Vampire Survivors Trailer | Free Update OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVfdLuyo9eU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Digiverse is a part of the game that sees multiple rifts opening that you can send your curators through to explore, bringing back items to display in your museums. Following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2L_z9phxxw">Dredge</a> and the original creation Meat Wizard back in August, Vampire Survivor is bringing all manner of adventuring heroes and the quest to find vampires, any vampires, to the museums of Two Point County.</p>


<p>Alas, there’s no new museum map for you to play with, but the Digiverse opens up three new POIs at the Mad Forest, Inlaid Library and Capella Magna, with 10 new pixelly exhibits to find, including Spinach and Santa Water. There’s also a whole batch of new decorative items, wallpapers, and VIPs that might visit.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Update 6.0 patch notes:</p>

		<p>The nights are drawing in and it’s getting much colder in the UK, meaning that it’s the perfect time for playing video games, basking in the warmth of our OLED screens and heat being pumped out by your PC’s GPU. I’ve been playing a lot of games this week, including Jurassic World Evolution 3, Nascar 25, Hades II, Ball X Pit, Lumines Arise, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch, while getting involved with my youngest son’s newfound obsession with Star Wars by playing Lego: The Skywalker Saga with him, <em>and</em> sneaking in a few matches in Battlefront II.</p>

<p>Keeping things much more controlled, Nic B has been playing Pokémon Z-A (or PukaPuka as his tiny son calls it) and while on review duties for us, he handed it a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">10/10</a>. This seems pretty good, if he’s to be trusted.</p>
<p>Next up, Aran has played a couple of games for review, including Keeper and Lumo 2. That’s all he’s allowed to say right now, but you won’t have too long to wait before those review embargoes lift. A matter of hours, even!</p>
<p>Jim has been fully hooked on Ghost of Yotei this week, freely exploring its gorgeous open world and ticking off the odd bounty and side quest as he goes. He told us, “I’m glad to report that the combat is becoming more varied and challenging. Atsu is also growing on me, though it’s fair to say that the true main character is the location. Easily the best-looking game of the year.</p>

<p>“I randomly installed a mobile game called SOVL, too. It feels like a fan-made video game adaptation of the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game, and it works incredibly well. Makes you wonder why Games Workshop haven’t tried something similar, in the same way that Wizards digitised MTG with Magic Arena.”</p>

<p>Ade has been on with Hades 2 this week, crushing the underworld run but finding that defeating the end boss on the surface still eludes him. He says, “It’s been an absolutely stonking year for video game releases, but, so far, Hades 2 is definitely my favourite!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Outer Worlds 2 for review, plus Rise of Industry and Dreams of Another. Once again, you’ve got to wait for those pesky embargoes to find out more.</p>
<p>Jason has uninstalled Ball X Pit “to save myself”, but he did at least wait until he’d fully 100%-ed it.&nbsp;Other than that, he’s been mucking around in Fellowship too, saying ” It is basically what you’d get if an MMO was designed for people who had responsibilities.”</p>

<p>And finally, Tef has been keeping up with Battlefield 6, dipping in for a few matches most days and plugging away at challenges. More interesting, though, has been dipping into a few Next Fest demoes. He wrote about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/you-should-play-the-demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-demo/">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> already, and he’s giving Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown a try today as well.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>Last year, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">The Crew Motorfest and The Crew 2 would both be getting offline modes</a>, and now that is a reality for The Crew 2. Ubisoft has released the Hybrid Mode update for The Crew 2, which allows players to continue playing the game online or to play The Crew 2 offline. If you are connected to the internet you can choose to play online or offline, but if you are not connected to the internet The Crew 2 will automatically launch into offline mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Crew Showcase 2025: new playground, race creator, offline mode…" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aydLtR1KzvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, it has to be noted that online and offline saves are separate. While online data can be exported offline, offline save data cannot be exported to online. In addition, any online save data that is transferred to offline will overwrite any offline save data. This means any offline progression you have made that does not match online will be lost. When it comes to rewards and DLC, these need to be claimed online then exported to the offline save so these items can be used there. The Crew Credits balance is included in offline save data so you can buy cars offline, but any items or bundles only available in the online Crew Credits store cannot be purchased offline. Ubisoft has listed what is not available in the offline mode:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sleek-node-id="HiVDq7">Crew Credits purchases (vehicle bundles, vanity items) and the Far &amp; Beyond shop in all 4 Hubs.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="J7tW7S">LIVE Summits.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="FW7W7e">All multiplayer content, including PvP, Crews, crew features, news feed, leaderboards, ghosts, and statistics menus. Only your own best times will be recorded per race.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="wuQTXL">UGC features, including the Race Creator and Livery Editor. Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="VGMvxu">Some Hobbies and Achievements (Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Ubisoft Connect) that require online-only actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no detail yet when The Crew Motorfest will get the Hybrid mode to add offline to that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What do you do when you’ve already made one of the best game controllers of all time? If you’re Victrix (or Turtle Beach, its parent company), you take a look for any missed opportunities and set to work again. That’s why we now have the BFG Reloaded. It’s a revision, rather than a revelation or revolution, but Victrix are steadily moving closer to peripheral perfection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro BFG™ Reloaded Wireless Modular Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdVQfElG71s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The BFG Reloaded is a wireless and wired, pro-styled modular controller, available for both the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, with either iteration also playing nicely with PC. The BFG was named after the ultimate weapon in Doom, and while they might be stretching that metaphor to its logical conclusion, Victrix made a controller that can make <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">a decent claim for it being the ultimate weapon for gamers</a>… and they’ve now reloaded it for another devastating blast.</p>


<p>In the box, you’re getting the controller itself, a sturdy hard case, modular units for the new Hall Effect left and right analogue sticks, and a revised six-button layout for fighting game aficionados that has shifted the inputs to make them more comfortable.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a thick braided cable in the requisite Victrix purple, alternate height analogue sticks, two further D-pad styles, as well as different-shaped gates for each analogue stick. All these options allow you to set the controller up exactly how you would want it, and there should be enough variety for everyone, no matter your skill level.</p>


<p>It’s a smart-looking piece of kit. If you were to turn up to a tournament with this in tow, you’d be certain of a few admiring glances. Our review unit came in black, but there’s also a white edition if that’s more your bag. It exudes modernity, edging towards futurism, but it doesn’t overdo the Cyberpunk, industrial vibes. In terms of visuals, I think it looks better than either Microsoft or Sony’s official controllers from this generation. Then again, at £170, it’s basically three times as expensive, so you’ll want something that bit more special.</p>
<p>Built from solid-feeling plastic, there’s rubberised grip sections at the front and wrapped around the rear grips, so it won’t slide about, even if you’re particularly prone to sweaty hands. These feel comfortable under your hand, and avoid the type of roughness you might experience with the P<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/powera-ops-v3-pro-wireless-controller-review/">owerA OPS V3 Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Gamesir Cyclone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Modular controllers are the Swiss Army Knife solution for pro controllers. Like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, the BFG Reloaded has alternate units that you can take out or swap in, allowing you to shift from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical stick layout, or to wholly change the controller setup by bringing in more face buttons for fans of games like Street Fighter 6. If you play a variety of different games to a competitive level, it makes more sense than most, as the BFG Reloaded can easily fulfil multiple roles.</p>

<p>It’s made particularly easy because you have a mini hex-shaped screwdriver in the case. Undoing each control unit is very straightforward, and you can whip the different parts out in a minute or two. To be honest, it’s fun just swapping the parts, never mind actually using them to play a game.</p>
<p>Visually, there’s little to differentiate the BFG Reloaded from its predecessor. This is fundamentally the same core controller, enhanced by the now-expected Hall Effect sticks and the improved fightpad layout. It is marginally more comfortable, but then, I didn’t have any problems with the original unit.</p>
<p>Amusingly, some members of the gaming community are now already decrying Hall Effect sticks as being a poor cousin to TMR sticks, even though the technology is a clear and distinct step up from the old-school potentiometer sticks we’ve had for years that have a nasty tendency to develop stick drift.</p>

<p>TMR sticks are admittedly newer and capable of being more precise, but Hall Effect sticks are still tried and tested, with proven durability that will last far longer than standard potentiometer sticks. The majority of players won’t be able to tell the difference between TMR and Hall Effect, and even at this price, I’m still happy to see Hall Effect sensors in place, and they feel excellent in the Pro BFG Reloaded.</p>
<p>The standard face button layout is enhanced by four further ‘pro’ inputs on the back, and I really like the way these are flared out, and differently sized so that they fit perfectly beneath your ring and middle fingers. They’re firm enough that I didn’t find myself accidentally hitting inputs, but quick enough to reliably perform in the heat of a Star Wars Battlefront II battle (my current multiplayer obsession).</p>
<p>At the rear, you’ll also find the lockouts for the triggers. Now, in the original version, I did find myself catching these at first, but I didn’t do that at all with the Reloaded edition, though perhaps that’s due to muscle memory. The lockouts reduce the travel of the triggers, and in doing so drastically improve your reaction time – generally a very good idea for games where you’re trying to shoot other people. Uniquely, you can set these at five different depths, and they’re independent of one another, giving you another level of customisation you won’t find elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are a few negatives though. The BFG Reloaded is coming out at the tail end of a year that’s seen multiple extremely competitive and advanced pro controller releases, and the triggers and the face buttons aren’t quite on the cutting edge that we’re seeing elsewhere.</p>
<p>The trigger shapes are excellent, comfortably rounded and perfectly flared, but they feel a touch too light and, in fairness, a little cheap and clacky. There’s also no mechanical switches in the standard control module – they are in the fight pad module, though – or in the trigger lockouts, and when that’s increasingly the norm that we’re seeing from manufacturers like Gamesir, it’s hard not to pine for the instantaneous feel you get from them.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded still feels fast and responsive in use. Turtle Beach list it as having 5ms of input lag, though I can only imagine that this is in the wired mode, or based on its polling rate, with further testing generally finding that it hovers around 9ms.</p>

<p>This is still very fast, but it does put it behind the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">DualSense Edge</a> or the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>. If you want the absolute fastest, this isn’t it, but equally, I prefer the way the Pro BFG Reloaded feels in the hand over both of those options.</p>
<p>Few controllers have the customisation and modularity of the BFG Reloaded, and if you’re the type of gamer who’ll repeatedly hop between Street Fighter 6 and Battlefield 5, or who’s looking to create a very particular setup, there’s no better option out there. I really like the construction materials and the way it feels in the hand, but there are still missed opportunities in terms of mechanical inputs throughout, and the triggers aren’t in line with the competition anymore.</p>
<p>On PlayStation, your only other option for modular-style control is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a>, which sees the extra controls hidden away in the body of the controller. The Pro BFG Reloaded is far more comfortable, though the Stealth Pivot is considerably cheaper at £120. On PC, if you’re looking for modularity, it’s well worth considering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a>, which has also just received a Hall Effect update, though this only comes in a wired option, and is better suited for larger hands.</p>

		<p>505 Games and Supernova Games Studios alongside KUNOS Simulazioni have announced Assetto Corsa Rally, and those who want to get hands on will not have to wait long as the game will be launched November 13th into Steam Early Access. The early access launch is going to be priced at £24.99 / $29.99 / €29,99.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueDItr3A3KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.”</em> said Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director. <em>“A special thanks goes to&nbsp;KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series – especially in terms of the driving model – in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can’t wait to share the journey with you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A rally version of Assetto Corsa, when?! It has been one of the most frequent questions I’ve received over these years, and I can finally provide an answer.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, Co-Founder of KUNOS Simulazioni and the Assetto Corsa franchise and Executive Manager for KUNOS Simulazioni.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches into early access, the content players will have access to includes 33km of fully laser scanned real life roads, four Special Stages with 18 variants, set across gravel roads in Wales and tarmac roads in Alsace, 10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles,<br>
five game modes, and triple screen support.

		<p>Pathea Games has announced that the alpha playtest for My Time At Evershine will begin on October 24th, and it will be for those who pledged $35 or more to the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam PC version of the game. Steam keys are going to be going out on October 21st and redeemable through PledgeManager, with My Time At Evershine then being available to download on October 24th. The key that is being sent out is not for the full game, as a separate key for that will be sent when the game is ready to release.</p>

<p>Those who have backed My Time At Evershine on Kickstarter but chose a console version are not eligible for the alpha playtest. However, that can be changed by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fill out the&nbsp;<b>[<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FM4qmMVsc6uVHAw1TA">Google Form here</a>]</b>&nbsp;to register your request. &nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>If you already selected Steam (PC) previously, you don’t need to fill out this form – unless you now want to switch from&nbsp;<b>Steam</b>&nbsp;(PC) to&nbsp;<b>console</b>&nbsp;instead.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>We’ll collect all responses and upload them to PledgeManager.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Once processed, you’ll receive a new invitation email to reopen your PledgeManager survey and select Steam. If you can’t find the invitation email, simply log back into PledgeManager to check your survey.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>The deadline for this first batch of console-to-PC requests is&nbsp;<b>October 22nd, 18:00 (UTC+8)</b>. That’s&nbsp;<b>03:00 AM PST / 06:00 AM EST / 12:00 PM CET.</b><wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Please double-check your selection when switching to Steam. Once your Steam key is assigned, your&nbsp;<b>Alpha platform</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<b>locked</b>&nbsp;and cannot be changed again.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>This round only covers&nbsp;<b>console-to-Steam switches for Alpha access.</b>&nbsp;Other cases – like switching between consoles or standard PC (non-Alpha) keys – will be handled later.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first round of keys being sent out for the My Time At Evershine alpha playtest, with this running until the game is released properly. If you do get into the playtest you will not be allowed to share any images, videos or thoughts about My Time At Evershine outside of the Pathea Games official channels.</p>
