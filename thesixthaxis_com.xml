		<p>If you’re reading this, then you’re surely wracking your brains and trying to remember all of the games that have been announced for 2026. Some of the big guns are easy to remember, and we’ll get to those later, but the breadth and depth of the games industry makes thinking of more than a dozen pretty tricky. So, we’ve opened up our book of dates, consulted with our filofax and card references, put boots on ground and feet up on desk, and come up with another five games you should keep an eye on. We have another ecletic mix of games from street racing to horror, sprinkled with some superheroes and supervillains beating each other up.</p>
<h2>35 – Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>

<h2>34 – Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 16th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Developer Big Bad Wolf is one of many game developers in recent years that has looked to Lovecraft for inspiration, and who can blame them when Lovecraftian horror has such an appeal to audiences? Big Bad Wolf’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-launches-an-occult-interpol-investigation-in-2026/">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> takes us to a future where in the year 2053 occult events are occurring more regularly, and the planet’s resources are scarce making companies explore the ocean floor for new opportunities. Unfortunately, those two events collide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThN3eSfWqUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss you play as occult investigator Noah who is investigating the disappearance of miners in the Pacific Ocean. This investigation leads Noah and his AI companion Key to the lost city of R’lyeh, where Cthulu’s influence is strong and will warp Noah’s mind too, affecting how you go about investigating clues and solving the puzzle of what’s happened.</p>
<h2>33 – Screamer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 23rd March 2026</em></p>
<p>Milestone is resurrecting the old street racing franchise <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/screamer">Screamer</a>, giving it a much-needed modern upgrade. It is an anime style arcade racer where teams compete against each other in fast cars to win races and take each other out, competing in a tournament to win some prestige and get some answers, which are much needed in the dystopian world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Screamer - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lh5ElfqaS74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, Milestone has announced five of the teams that make up the competitors including Green Reapers, Strike Force Romanda, Jupiter Stormers, Anaconda Corp, and Kagawa-Kai. Each team has its own distinct style, with each of the three racers in each team having their own cars to use, like colourful cars of Strike Force Romanda who are a former girl group. Screamer is standing out as an arcade racer to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2>32 – Tides of Tomorrow</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tides of Tomorrow - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVjNGNZcqHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h2>31 – The Blood of Dawnwalker</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a> is the first game from Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz along with CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Having such big names behind it, The Blood of Dawnwalker has high expectations placed on it as a new dark open world RPG.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coen is the main character and he is a Dawnwalker, making him part human and part vampire. He has come to be a Dawnwalker after a powerful vampire saves Coen’s sister’s life and takes Coen’s blood as payment. It is not a simple transaction as this vampire wants to rule over humanity. As the Dawnwalker, Coen has two different ability sets depending on the time of day. During the day, Coen is a human and is limited to human skills but at night he gains his vampire powers allowing him to enter different locations and use vampire powers in combat. The world reacts to Coen’s decisions and lack of decisions, shaping how dangerous it is him for him and the people he cares for.</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today, but come back tomorrow where we’ll make it up to the midway point of our Most Wanted games.</em></p>
