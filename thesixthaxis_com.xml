		<p>Team Ninja’s PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is coming to PC on 11th March 2025, Koei Tecmo has revealed, just shy of the first anniversary of its original release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - PC Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4FFRu9HHY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from the Nioh Soulslikes, Team Ninja pivoted with Rise of the Ronin to tell a more traditional historical tale set in the Bakumatsu period of the country’s history. The game features a wide open world and puts the power in your hands to determine how the story unfolds, depending on how you ally yourself with the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces.</p>
<p>The PC version is being enhanced well beyond the PS5 original with ultra-wide monitor support, 8K resolution support, 120FPS, ray tracing and more.</p>
<p>Here’s Koei Tecmo’s list of what they’ve done for the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>8K resolution support</li>
<li>DirectX 12 Ultimate support</li>
<li>Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility</li>
<li>120FPS support</li>
<li>Ray tracing support</li>
<li>3D audio support</li>
<li>Customizable keyboard and mouse controls</li>
<li>AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support</li>
<li>UI menu with mouse clickability</li>
<li>Intel XeSS graphics technology support</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those are reaching quite a bit. I don’t think having a clickable UI is big enough of a deal to mention, and mentioning 3D audio here is about supporting PC implementations of 3D audio, where PS5 had support via the Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p>
<p>The game flew under the radar a little by the time that Game of the Year awards rolled around, but Rise of the Ronin was a great exclusive for PS5 early in 2024. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/rise-of-the-ronin-review/">In our own review we scored it a stellar 9/10</a>, Aran saying that “Rise of the Ronin is a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>
