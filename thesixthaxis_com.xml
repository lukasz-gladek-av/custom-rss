		<p>Yes, I know. That’s a hyperbolic title, but we love hyperbole on the internet, right? Darksiders 2 has just re-re-released on current-gen consoles, with some love given to the code to make it as shiny and smooth as possible. That’s all well and good, but what this return really showcases, is just how good the game is, was and always will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition | PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXqem-g5ABs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s get the explanation out of the way. I have bought Darksiders 2 on every single platform that it has released on. It is one of the reasons – alongside Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and Xenoblade Chronicles – that I will never sell my Wii U, and that’s slightly mental when I can play it on Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One via backwards compatibility. And that’s before its newly enhanced release on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles – it’s a free upgrade to be a full cross-gen game now. The only place I can’t play it anymore is on Google Stadia, and I can just about live with that.</p>


<p>So, I like the game. A huge part of that is the artwork and design of Joe Madureira. The former Marvel Comics artist was Creative Director for the Darksiders series, and his ethos, outlook and chunky art style permeates the game. The opening cutscene is delivered via his distinctive comic-style artwork, and it immediately sets the tone for the series, while catching you up on the events of the first game.</p>


<p>It’s a genuine feast for the eyes, and the improved 4K resolution of the re-release means that it’s crisper and more vibrant than ever before. There’s now ray tracing and improved ambient lighting, and it all zips along at a fixed 60fps, so Death just feels slicker, looks better. In many ways, it just doesn’t look a game from two console generations ago, thanks to the Joe Mad’s timeless design.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that you don’t have to have played the first one, and while you definitely should if you want to make the most of the world, and to fully understand every element of the story, Darksiders 2 is the superior game in pretty much every way. With this current-gen upgrade, there’s now a chasm between the two.</p>

<p>You play as Death. He’s a gravelly-voiced, violent, and slightly conceited central hero, but he’s incredibly powerful, and unequivocally cool. He can utilise a host of extremely large weapons, zip around the battlefield, and climb and clamber across the landscape with ease, and he’s just a delight to control and embody. Few games have mechanics that are as solid and simply enjoyable as Darksiders 2.</p>
<p>That ties into the Zelda-like puzzling and exploration that carried over from the first Darksiders, while bringing a new dungeon-crawling outlook to loot, with a steady stream of slightly different weaponry and armour to sift through and equip, generally making Death look even cooler. If that’s even possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only point where you can tell this is an older release is in some of the animations. Death’s motorisation is noticeably less smooth than you’d expect in 2024, but you soon forget when lava creatures are trying to tear you limb from limb. The 60fps delivery also makes it feel fresher and more immediate, and Death almost feels lumpen and less agile going back to the previous PS4 Deathinitive version, never mind the original PS3/360 release.</p>

<p>There are elements of my Darksiders 2 obsession that are pretty inexpicable. I like Death’s voice way more than&nbsp; I should do – Michael Wincott delivering an outstanding performance that’s part-man, part-shingle beach – and it’s fundamentally a straightforward Xbox 360 adventure through a fantasy world, reminiscent of many games from the era.</p>
<p>But, and it’s a big BUT, Darksiders 2 overcomes any questions of age or mechanics by simply being hugely enjoyable. For me, it’s a living comic book, beautiful and intriguing, and just like your favourite graphic novels, Darksiders 2 deserves to be picked up and read, over and over again. With this new release, that’s only more obvious, and it genuinely makes it nigh-on essential if you’re a fan of fantasy action games.</p>
<p>I know, I’m as surprised as you are.</p>
