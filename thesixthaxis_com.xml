		<p>Half Sword Games has announced that its medieval combat simulator Half Sword will be entering early access on January 30th, giving players the chance to start their journey from lowly commoner to champion knight of the entire realm. The new early access trailer shows some of the combat scenarios players will enter including fist fights to full on sword, shield, and spears. Then there are the traps in each arena to take out opponents.</p>

<p>In a statement Half Sword Games said, <em>“Thank you for waiting for this extra month, we hope you rested well on your holidays and now you are ready for all the new stuff we prepared for you! <wbr>As you understand, we are still working on the game and new content will be added as we continue our way into the full release. <wbr>Bugs, performance, occasional crashes and other things are being actively ironed out as fast as our tiny team can handle. <wbr>Please, feel free to inform us of any issues that affect your immersion in the skirmishes of Half Sword.”</em></p>
<p>As a simulation game, Half Sword will test you in different battles and if you lose a fight and die, that will be the end of that run. There is no coming back from having your head lopped off after all. The game will have plenty of gore and the combat has been shaped with input from Historical European Martial Arts professionals, with each weapons impact on the body shown in the game. Each victory brings you income and a growth in reputation allowing you to buy better equipment to keep climbing the tournament ladder of 15th century Europe.</p>
