<p>Kaizen Game Works is known for Paradise Killer. In our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/paradise-killer-review-pc-switch/"> Paradise Killer review</a>, Miguel wrote,&nbsp;<em>“Paradise Killer is a pure, unguided detective mystery that doesn’t dare hold your hand. You, and you alone, are in charge of seeking out not only the truth of this locked room murder, but the truth of the wild and cosmically corrupt world that the game takes place in. The open ended nature of the investigation can be daunting at first, and while some clunky platforming and frequent periods of downtime can sour the experience just a bit, Paradise Killer still manages to be one of the most well put together and utterly satisfying mystery games I’ve ever experienced.”</em></p>
