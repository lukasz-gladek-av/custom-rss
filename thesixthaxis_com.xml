		<p>Goblinz Publishing and developer Duper Games has announced that Day of the Shell, a turn based tactical roguelite, will be released on July 29th for PC and consoles. Ahead of the full release, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082100/Day_of_the_Shell_Prologue/">Day of the Shell: Prologue</a> has been released for free on PC via Steam. You can check out what the gameplay of the game looks like in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Day of the Shell: Prologue contains one world with 13 islands to explore, the revolver and crossbow weapons, 12 relics and nine blessings that can be combined, five enemy types, and seven runes that upgrade the main character’s passive abilities. The gameplay of Day of the Shell has been described as one click, one turn with each turn requiring one choice to keep the gameplay fast paced. The setting of the game is post apocalyptic following the gods destroying most of it and humanity, leaving a few islands for monster hunter Huntress to explore. The features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>One Click, One Turn: Tactical choices are made with a single click, making gameplay simple and dynamic while maintaining strategic depth.</em></li>
<li><em>Explore the Islands: Survive against monsters and collect treasures on each island to open its portal. Will you be able to reach the heart of the Islands and destroy the Shell?</em></li>
<li><em>Shape Your Destiny: Combine the powers of the many Warden’s blessings to fight your enemies. Different variations and combinations will allow you to create a unique playstyle for each game.</em></li>
<li><em>Death is Part of the Adventure: With each death, you return to your home island, where you can permanently upgrade or consider your strategy for the next day.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/craftlings-are-as-absent-minded-as-lemmings-but-theyre-capable-of-much-more/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you see Craftlings and think “Oh cool! It’s a bit like Lemmings!” then Ariano Games’ work is halfway done. At first glance, this really does look a lot like Lemmings without the bright green hair, but it shouldn’t take long to see that this is a very different style of strategy game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Craftlings Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5JGBSo_T_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Craftlings are, similar to the Lemmings that inspired them, about as hapless as they come. They’ll just wander straight forward, only turning around if they encounter a wall they can’t clamber up, or something that clearly tells them to go back the other way. If there’s nothing to stop them, they’ll more than happily march off a cliff or high-up ledge and plummet to their doom… and then another Craftling spawns in.</p>


<p>It’s up to you to guide them, keep them safe and busy, and channel their tireless efforts in a productive direction toward the objective. Instead of just reaching a simple exit portal, you task them with constructing buildings, growing and evolving a village as you look to meet the demands of the level. In the first stage, that’s to build a ballista to fire at a giant octopus that’s clearly one very bad dude.</p>


<p>Building takes resources, and gathering resources requires tools, meaning you need to build up a little supply chain to get things done. You don’t just buy a pickaxe and give it to a Craftling, but instead have to build the Mining Shed that makes them in exchange for wood and coins, a Craftling then automatically grabbing a pickaxe once created and marching straight ahead until they find some rock to smash, before dragging the rock back to town and dropping it wherever it’s needed.</p>
<p>There’s no real thought behind this from the Craftlings, so it’s up to you to create the paths and marshal their efforts. Place ladders if they need to go between different levels, place blockers to just turn them back around – thankfully, you don’t need to sacrifice a Craftling for this most menial of jobs – and conditional arrows that can allow and prohibit certain Craftlings with certain items in hand. In fact, everything’s conditional. Click on the blocker and it’s disabled for a bit; click on the arrow boards and you can change their rules; click on a Craftling and they’ll hop and head back the other way.</p>

<p>It’s a rather satisfying twist on the classic style, but Craftlings promises to go much further. There’s further nuances, like heavy objects needing you to place mechanical lifts to raise and lower them between levels, as they can’t be dragged up and down ladders. Latter levels also introduce combat, which naturally requires you to build a barracks, to equip and train Craftlings to be able to defeat skeleton enemies.</p>
<p>That was one of the main new challenges in the third level that we briefly tried –&nbsp;a new stage that goes beyond the two levels currently found in the public demo. Alas, with time running out and my Craftlings unable to defeat the skeletal menace standing between them and some bricks I needed, I had to get rather creative.</p>
<p>While you need the Craftlings to do a lot of the work, you do still have a good amount of arbitrary god-like control in this strategy game. You place key structures like the material lift, you have magic bubbles and tricks to send a single Craftling up and down between levels, and you also have dynamite to just destroy certain obstacles and items in the world, depositing many items back in your inventory.</p>
<p>And with a mean skeleton in my way, that got me thinking. Could I just delete the ground beneath it? No, Ariano Games has thought of that, but could I tunnel beneath him? And then build out a platform beyond him with a ladder up to where the bricks were? Using blockers and timely clicks to bounce the Craftlings away from danger and back towards town?</p>
<p>Well actually…. yes!</p>

<p>Look, I’m not too proud about breaking the puzzle design –&nbsp;OK, I’m quite proud about it –&nbsp;but it does show that there’s some creative freedom with how you can tackle certain tasks, and that’s part of the magic of sandbox titles and the 90s games that were the source of inspiration for Craftlings. Finding your own path and your own solution is always much more fun than just following the main designed path.</p>
<p>If that’s tickled the nostalgic part of your brain, then make sure to check out Craftlings for yourself. There’s no announced release date, but there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">a demo available on Steam</a> with two levels from the game, and you can obviously wishlist it to keep tabs on its progress.</p>

		<p>Unfrozen has released a brand new gameplay trailer for the turn based title Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, which is the official prequel to the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games. Originally, the studio was working solely with Ubisoft to develop the game, but yesterday that changed when Unfrozen announced that publisher Hooded Horse has come on board as a publishing partner for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. Ubisoft remains the IP holder for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Gameplay Trailer | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlVlN7NXF00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First, let’s start with the gameplay trailer for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. As the game is a prequel to the main series it will have story beats and events that have been referenced in other games, as well as have its own stories. In the gameplay trailer, you can see that the combat will remain turn based and take place across vibrant and varying biomes on the continent of Jadame. As the player you will have the option to choose which faction to play as, and make choices that impact the entire continent. The playable factions include Temple (Classic Humans), Necropolis (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Underground Creatures and Dark Elves), and Hive (Demonic Insectoids). Unfrozen has stated that there is another faction that is yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era will have a campaign that can be played solo, as well as classic, one hero, and arena modes. In classic mode, players choose their heroes, upgrade their castle and explore the map. One hero mode is a blitz mode with only one hero so when they fall it is all over. Arena mode is all about jumping straight into battle with different enemies. There will also be an in-game editor where players can create and share scenarios. The game is going to be released into Early Access first via Steam, and you can request access for playtests on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era Steam</a> page.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/krafton-replaces-subnautica-2-studio-co-founders-effective-immediately/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Krafton has announced a major leadership shake up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/unknown-worlds">Unknown Worlds</a>, with co-founders Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire leaving the studio “effectively immediately”, being replaced by new CEO Steve Papoutsis, who’s coming over from Callisto Protocol team Striking Distance Studios.</p>
<p>This is a very significant change, with the Subnautica 2 early access release still aiming for later this year, and is a major cause for concern amongst the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica">Subnautica</a> community.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> publisher Krafton is keep to express that while they “sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.” So why has this happened?</p>
<p>Through the press release, there’s an expectation that Papoutsis will being “renewed energy and momentum to delivering the long-anticipated Subnautica 2 experience to fans.” While Krafton CEO CH Kim says that “Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The statement goes on to discuss Krafton’s oversight putting regular milestones and progress assessments in place for all its studios, and that “Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process.”</p>

<p>So, it doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that Subnautica 2’s early access release might have been in doubt for 2025. That could have been through missing milestone already or from wanting more time. Papoutsis has been put in place to ensure that a product is delivered this year.</p>
<p>Papoutsis has come across from Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios. The tail end of Callisto Protocol’s development was mired in controversy over glorifying crunch culture at the studio, with employees pushed to work 6-7 day weeks. Then studio head <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Glen Schofield walking back and apologising</a> for comments that seemed to glorify this approach. In an interview following his departure from SDS, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">Schofield then claimed that Krafton forced the game to be released three months earlier</a> than had been agreed, leading to cut content and the aforementioned crunch.</p>

			<p>Imagine how much better the world would be if we all did parkour and freerunning. Your commute would be twice as fast if you could parkour your way across town to the office, the kids would never drag their heels on a Monday morning if they knew they could hand-spring and wall-run their way to school, and you’d never get bored waiting in line at Asda if you knew you could throw out a standing back-flip every now and again.</p>
<p>Well, prepare to be amazed, my friend. Because in Rooftops &amp; Alleys, everyone can be a freerunner. In your own living room. Whilst sat on your couch. Even while playing a video game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rooftops &amp; Alleys - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gkso_Cs85xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rooftops &amp; Alleys gives you six varied maps to explore, with a mixture of time trial and trick rush challenges scattered around for you to test your parkour skills and rack up points. Although the maps aren’t overly large, they don’t really need to be. A diverse range of platforms, poles, walls and ramps are carefully positioned to help you maximise your trick combos. Plus, there’s a handy pigeon mode that, a bit like in Assassin’s Creed, gives you a bird’s eye view of the map to plan your tricks and to help you access hard to reach places.</p>
<p>The music to Rooftops &amp; Alleys does cartwheels around other game soundtracks. This isn’t surprising, given that the solo developer behind MLMEDIA, Michel Losch, worked in the music industry for 15 years. The trance, R&amp;B and electronica vibes partner the game’s style and energy like a precisely executed Double Kong.</p>

<p>In fact, the soundtrack manages to achieve the goal that all good soundtracks should aim for – but all too many fall short of – it makes you <em>want</em> to play the game. It gets you in the mood and keeps you playing. So, I couldn’t help but wall-flip in and try my best to parkour like a pro.</p>
<p>And try I did. I tried. And tried. And tried.</p>
<p>And occasionally actually landed a free running move.</p>

<p>Free running is about the accurate and controlled execution of movements, and Rooftops and Alleys is no different with its controls. This game isn’t for button-mashing. No matter how frustrated you get when you JUST. CAN’T. DO. IT. RIGHT! The controls are tricky and require very precise input from the player. There is a helpful tutorial, but it only covers the basics of the tricks and aerials you can perform, leaving you feeling completely unprepared for when you throw yourself off a platform and faceplant the floor.</p>
<p>The gameplay is then made harder by occasionally fritzy controls. You can actually manage to press all the right buttons in the right order, but for some unknown reason, your avatar doesn’t do the thing you’ve asked it to do. It occasionally rag-dolls even when you’re not doing anything. Oh, and you can glitch through walls. It all adds up to a teeth-clenchingly frustrating ten minutes of trying to do wall-runs, failing miserably and then resisting the urge to parkour my controller straight into my TV screen.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all these major freerunning fails lead to some hilarious wipeouts! The sound effect of my avatar clanging their head on a pole then clattering to the floor made me laugh a lot more than it should. It’s this ability to laugh at yourself – and others! – that makes the online play so joyous. Chasing each other up the walls of a church just to take it in turns to clang the church bell with your noggin will never grow old. Plus, the good-sized fan network of Rooftops and Alleys means there’s always someone to play with, even if they’re as clumsy at the controls as you are.</p>

<p>So, is it cartwheels or wipeouts for Rooftops &amp; Alleys? Fans of the straightforward freerunning elements in Assassins Creed may be left a little overwhelmed by the demands of Rooftops &amp; Alleys. But those who love the point scoring system of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater will relish the challenge offered by the game. The thrill of completing a complex aerial trick with a perfect touchdown brings a true rush to the player, but if you struggle to grasp the complex inputs required, the gameplay suddenly becomes very limited. It’s because of this that Rooftops and Alleys didn’t really stick the landing for me.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rooftops and Alleys is close to being a flipping great parkour game. This trick-filled, point-scoring, freerunning experience has a banging soundtrack and hilarious online play, but the fussy and frustrating controls stop it from climbing to the next level.	</p></div>
