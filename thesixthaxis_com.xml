		<p>Redemption Road’s barmy time-travelling medieval war game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> is set to hit Steam Early Access on 8th October 2025. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, uh, what’s going on there, then? Well, the future is about to crumble into an apocalypse, but there’s thankfully a chance to set things right by bouncing back in time 500 years and turning the tide of a brutal medieval war in England. You’ve got to change history, and since the chances of a time traveller just dying from stepping on a rusty nail and not having a tetanus shot are pretty much astronomical, you need to stack the odds in your favour by bringing some modern day toys with you.</p>
<p>Yup, that means running around with fully automatic assault rifles, RPGs, hopping onto motorbikes and into tanks that can just drive through stuff. With all of this at hand, you have a much better chance, but one man with a machine gun isn’t going to survive an enemy army, even if they are running at you with swords. So you can build cities and castles, recruit soldiers to your cause and raise armies to conquer the rest of the country, blending in RTS action with the third person battling.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can bring some friends with you too with support for up to 4 player co-op.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">announced back at Day of the Devs last June</a>, Kingmakers was then expected for a Q1 2025 early access release, but has naturally slipped back a fair bit to October. There’s real potential here to be that silly online co-op hit, though, so hopefully it arrives in good shape.</p>

		<p>Build A Rocket Boy and IOI Partners have released a big new explainer trailer for MindsEye, their ambitious open world shooter and user-generated content <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/mindseye-is-launching-in-everywhere-but-what-does-that-mean/">Everywhere</a> platform that is set to launch on 10th June for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of MindsEye takes place in Redrock City, a near future metropolis in which humans and machines battle for power and control, which is shown through the power struggle between Mayor Shiva Vega and tech genius Marco Silva, who is also the founder of the technology firm Silva Industries. Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his own past.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off plenty of cinematics from the story, missions that even take you up to space, and a whole bunch of third person shooter combat. In these segments, you’ll have plenty of conventional guns to choose from, but also have an AI drone buddy that can do area recon and stun enemies, hack evil I, Robot movie robots to fight alongside you and more.</p>
<p>It’s brought together by in-game “portals” branded Play.Mindseye to access moments from the official story and the open world, as well as hop into the “infinite entertainment” of user-generated missions through the PC-based Build.Mindseye tools. It’s a full-blown level and mission editor, providing the platform for people to make their own games. This is a part of the Everywhere platform, as mentioned above, a counterpart and rival to Fortnite’s UGC tools, and more presciently, to GTA 5 and the upcoming GTA 6.</p>

<p>At launch the game will have the single player content in free roam, as well as separate races, checkpoint races, and drone races. This will expand through content updates to add more missions, multiplayer (in the autumn), community updates and “special collaborations”. More will be added for those buying the premium edition of the game.</p>

<p>For such an ambitious title, it’s perhaps surprising that the marketing hasn’t been more intense. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">first revealed in February</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/mindseye-release-date-set-for-june-10th/">release date was only announced in March</a>, but this production is clearly setting its sights on Grand Theft Auto Online’s audience. That’s hardly surprisingly when the team was founded by Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar and producer on pretty much everything from GTA 3 through to GTA 5.</p>
<p>The run up to launch has also been quite restrained in terms of only granting preview to a select few YouTubers, from what we can see, and with no coverage from major gaming sites. Impressions were… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">less</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKKAMa6sXxE">than</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhWeYRoZl4E">favourable</a>. These previews were live, but remote and hands off, limiting the potential for appraisal.</p>
<p>So, uh… yeah, 10th June’s going to be interesting and we’re keen to go hands on for ourselves.</p>

			<p>In the world of anthropomorphic gaming characters, bats are relatively rare. There seem to be countless foxes and cats running around competing quests and being heroes, so having a little bat dude with a yoyo is a refreshing change of pace. That being said, Pippit being a bat has very little bearing on the game itself – he can’t even fly! What our batty hero <em>does</em> have, however, is an incredible useful yoyo that serves as both weapon and navigation device in some of the most intricately designed top down levels you’ll find outside of a traditional Zelda dungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo - Release Date &amp; Console Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jE-RFPhjTjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We first meet Pippit on his way back from a big yoyo tournament as he recounts his excitement to a bemused taxi driver. The driver’s tone changes as soon as he realises that the young bat is a member of the dominant Pipistrello family who run the energy monopoly in the city. The scene is set for Pippit to be the exception to the rule in a family that seems to be a direct analogue for multinationals and corporations. Pippit is on his way to visit his aunt, the CEO of the company, but this trip does not go as planned. The end result is his aunt’s soul being split between four mega-batteries held by area bosses with the remaining part trapped within Pippit’s yoyo.</p>


<p>Pipistrello is a gorgeous game. Lovely pixel art and detailed backgrounds set the scene and there is also a real sense of character to the main antagonists. The range of enemies is decent, with new ones being introduced regularly throughout the game, each having specific attack patterns and weaknesses for you to learn. The soundtrack is solid too, with a surprising collaboration with Yoko Shimomura of Kingdom Hearts fame (amongst many others).</p>


<p>I played through the game on my Steam Deck, a choice that seemed to make sense given the in-game conceit that Pipistrello is being played on a Pocket Trap handheld (named after the devs themselves) and it performed excellently on that device. I was a little disappointed that nothing was really made of the meta framing idea of this being a new handheld system, but that might be a running theme for their future titles.</p>
<p>So, that’s the background and aesthetic covered, how does Pipistrello play? The closest comparison to the game is a traditional top-down Zelda game as you explore an overworld with areas locked off by specific abilities and upgrades to find dungeons that revolve around the skilful use of said new skills. Obviously Nintendo’s flagship adventure series has evolved to become a different (Divine) beast in recent years, but I freely admit to being one of those who have a stronger connection to the earlier titles. With that in mind, Pipistrello was both perfectly pitched for me but also found itself in direct competition with my nostalgic memories.</p>
<p>Exploring the overworld is kept fresh through some witty interactions with various locals, a large number of hidden items and some tricky environmental puzzles to get access to each boss area. As you explore the dense cityscape you can unlock taxi points to enable fast travel. This becomes especially useful when searching for collectables and upgrades later in the game.</p>

<p>Initially, your yoyo is relatively basic and can be used as a melee weapon or to grab items that are out of reach. Levels are intricately designed with triangular blocks that you can bounce your yoyo off to reach further. Identifying these blocks and the pattern they set out is crucial to navigating the levels and the game excellently trains you in spotting the different ways these can be set out. By the end of the game you’ll be pulling off yoyo parkour sections that look impossible at the beginning. These skills are also needed to tackle the various bosses throughout the game and these fights are well designed and challenging.</p>
<p>As well as simple back and forth yoyo abilities you unlock various more complex skills named after all the famous yoyo moves like Around the World and Walk the Dog. It does leave me to ask what happened to yoyos in the real world? They were huge for a few years in the 80s and 90s but I can’t remember the last time I saw somebody with one. Anyway, these abilities can be used in both combat encounters and in exploring the world as you’ll eventually be able to soar across water hazards, grind around the walls to avoid pits and even suspend the yoyo in midair and use it to spring across impassable gaps. Once your full range of skills is unlocked the sheer thrill of navigating the complex levels is up there with the best of Nintendo’s own game design.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Pispistrello and the Cursed Yoyo is a fantastic top down adventure game that deserves to be considered in the same echelon as classic Nintendo titles. It takes the traditional Zelda framework and reimagines it to create a world that is incredibly fun to explore. The thrill of nailing the yoyo traversal mechanics remains throughout and while the combat can be a little repetitive at times, this is equally the case with Link's various adventures. All in all, this is peak indie gaming and comes very highly recommended.	</p></div>
