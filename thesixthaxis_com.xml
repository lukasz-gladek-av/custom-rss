<p><em><span>“We are so excited to be able to share </span><span>Spray Paint Simulator</span></em><span><em> with players very soon,”</em> said Nick Jefferson-Tame, Lead Artist and Creative Director at North Star Video Games. <em>“The support we’ve received from players during development has been wonderful, and their feedback invaluable. It’s been amazing to see how they’ve taken to the game, and they’ve given us excellent thoughts on how we can make the game its best at launch. We can’t wait for everyone to see the full game in just a few short weeks.”</em></span></p>
<p>Players find themselves in the town of Splatterville, where its residents have a number of requests to brighten the town up. In each job you will need to prep the job space, and get the right colours to meet your clients’ needs. As your business grows you will be able to upgrade your equipment, tools, and vehicles which in turn help complete the bigger jobs. There is a Free Spray mode as well that lets you go wherever you want in the town to repaint it how you wish, and this can be done alone or with a friend in co-op. If you want to try before you buy you can, as there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811340/Spray_Paint_Simulator/">Spray Paint Simulator demo on Steam</a>.</p>
