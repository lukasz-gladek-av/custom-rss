		<p>This last week has whizzed by, and perhaps some of that was down to the joy I found in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-confirms-open-beta-for-next-week/">Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a>. It’s a true sequel to Monster Hunter Worlds, and while I’m very sad to see the Palamutes and Wirebugs of Monster Hunter Rise head off into the sunset, I’m more than happy with what Capcom are serving up! Other than that, there’s been more Metaphor ReFantazio, a heap of Empire of the Ants and a sniff of F1 24.</p>
<p>Checking in with the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Diablo IV’s latest expansion, Phasmophobia, Baldur’s Gate 3, and D&amp;D. Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> is very late to the party but he picked up Helldivers 2 the other day and sayd, “OH MY GOOD GRIEF WHAT A GAME! The most fun I’ve had with an online multiplayer in years. Helldivers 2 has shot it’s way straight into GOTY position for me!” So, I think he liked it.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <strong>Aran</strong> as he’s been suffering with illness this week – hope you get better soon mate! <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has continued with his standard dose of Destiny 2 and a little Beat Saber.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/the-smurfs-dreams-review/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> for review, both of which “were enjoyable in very different ways”. He continues, “I have got another highly anticipated horror game on the go for review next week so that’ll be my main focus. Other than that I have been polishing off the last few remaining Steam Next Fest demos and have put together a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">recommendation list</a>.”</p>


<p>Then we’re onto <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s week has almost exclusively been dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. He absolutely loved it, saying, “It’s my favourite COD since Black Ops 2 and manages to deliver on all fronts though the acrobatic omnidirectional movement takes some getting used to.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> snuck in a few matches of Black Ops 6 as well, but hasn’t started the campaign yet. Instead, this week he quickly checked out the spooky <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/lego-islands-mystery-of-the-monolith-wraps-up-with-lego-dark-space/">Lego Dark Space level in Fortnite</a>, got to share some thoughts about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/hands-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and put together a compare ’em up piece for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>This week saw the global launch of Pokemon TCG Pocket for Android and iOS devices, having been available in New Zealand for the last month. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today, following the global launch on October 30th, sees the first event that players can take part in outside of the standard missions. This event is Wonder Pick Event Part 1, with Chansey and Meowth being the focus. From today, and for the next two weeks, special promo card versions of Chansey and Meowth will appear in Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>
<p>Alongside the chance to get either the promo Chansey or Meowth, there are also new additions to the the Pokemon TCG Pocket shop, which are only available for the duration of the Wonder Pick Event Part 1. The three items available are a Meowth backdrop, a Meowth binder cover, and a pink desk frame to use for display boards. There are no new card sleeves, Pokemon flip coins, or playmats. The event items all cost 3 event shop tickets each.</p>

		<p>Red Barrels has announced that it is partnering with Lionsgate to create a movie based on Outlast, with the game series writer, JT Petty, handling the writing of the screenplay. The Outlast movie is going to be produced by Roy Lee, who has previously been a producer on the likes of The Strangers: Chaper 1, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and IT. No actors have yet been confirmed for any of the roles for the Outlast movie.</p>
<p><em>“As die-hard fans of horror ourselves, we hold immense respect for Roy Lee and Lionsgate,”</em> said David Chateauneuf, Co-Founder and Creative Director at Red Barrels. <em>“Horror films, both classic and modern, have profoundly influenced our franchise, and collaborating on an Outlast&nbsp;film with true horror legends is a dream— or should we say, a nightmare—come true.”</em></p>


<p>Roy Lee also had this to say about the Outlast movie. <em>“When Outlast launched in 2013, it changed the landscape of horror gaming,” Roy explains. “Its deep, emergent lore provides the perfect foundation for a film that explores the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and dedicated fans.”</em></p>
<p>The Outlast series kicked off in 2013 with the original game, which was a first person horror game in which players took on the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explored the Mount Massive Asylum, which contained a lot of secrets and horrors to avoid and escape from. This was followed by the prequel Outlast: Whistleblower, in which players are Waylon Park, a software engineer at the asylum who gets the word out to Miles which leads to the events of the first game. Outlast 2 followed in 2017, introducing a new protagonist called Blake Langermann, another investigative journalist, who finds himself a poor rural area where a doomsday cult lives. The Outlast Trials is the most recent game, adding a multiplayer spin to the series.</p>
