			<p>It’s always a risk when a series brings back a character whose story was complete and made way for other leads and stories. Sure, it can absolutely be a fan-pleasing follow up, but it can smack of desperation at times – see Marvel bringing back Robert Downey Jr. – or see character shifts as a new writer takes the helm. You never quite know how it will land. I might not have personally cared for Max Caulfield in the original Life is Strange, but developer Deck Nine has brought her back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> complete with all her awkwardness, incessant photograph taking, and interfering with the lives and business of a host of new characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Power and Suspects Trailer - Life is Strange: Double Exposure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIZ03LPvTBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We pick up with Max after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">the events of Arcadia Bay</a> in her new life as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University. She has, since those events, lost her ability to rewind time and the aftermath of the events of her previous adventure weighs heavy on her with flashbacks from time to time littered throughout the story of Double Exposure.</p>


<p>One thing I must highlight that impresses me about Double Exposure is how it handles the absence of Chloe, who was obviously very important in the first game. Instead of Deck Nine picking a canonical ending, they put the choice in your hands, asking what part of the world you elected to decimate in the final moments of Life is Strange. There’s a deft touch to how they explain Chloe’s absence in either scenario.</p>


<p>The story here does take a while to get going, but it really impresses upon you the friendship between Max, Safi and Moses as they simply hang out and chat in a bar or gaze together at the night sky. It doesn’t take long before a murder kicks the story into gear, that initial warmth of the world giving way to multiple plot threads following the intrigue around power held by the Abraxas group within the university, lecturers barely hiding secrets, and the hapless students seemingly stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>The central mystery is a bit of a slow burn, but there’s other plot threads and smaller mysteries for you to unpack that help the the game’s moving along, many of them meshing back into the overarching story as well.</p>
<p>Life is Strange would be nothing without its characters and would definitely not be without some very mixed character work. On the “bad” side, we have the nosey investigative reporter Loretta who rubs Max the wrong way almost immediately, and Vinh’s secrecy and slimy flirting with Max that feels distinctly uncomfortable. But then, on the other hand, you have the fantastic writing of characters like Safi and the instantly likeable potential love interest, Amanda.</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure plays pretty much like any other game in this series. You explore each chapter, interacting with an array of characters, solving small puzzles in the world, and making anxiety-inducing decisions that come complete with the terrifying words “This action will have consequences” appearing on screen. A lot of these decisions, even though they’re simple A or B choices, have lasting impact on the story and game that you might not see for hours, if you even remember choosing it.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, you’ll be given a little breakdown of all the things that you could have impacted on and what you did if you did find them. What’s more, it puts each of these things with a little percentage of players of the game that made each choice. These can be as innocuous as fixing the alignment of some paintings, or as game altering as permanently making an enemy of a character. I must admit that, more than anything else during the review period, this revealed that I’m a terrible person when I play games.</p>
<p>However, this wouldn’t be a Life is Strange game without an interesting gameplay quirk to it and this time Max comes with a brand-new set of powers to replace the ability to rewind time, giving her the far less cool power to move between realities. The main way this ability manifests is being able to physically move between the timeline where your friend has died (known bluntly as the Dead timeline) and another where they are still alive (the Living timeline), allowing you to interact with characters and the world in each.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to locate and speak to the same characters in both timelines to progress or bring items or objects from one to the other, but there is this constant interplay between the two timelines that is used in some clever ways. One particular use that comes to mind was a segment where you need to listen in on a conversation, moving into a different timeline and then reaching back to hear what they’re saying without them noticing.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that this can be a little overwhelming at times, as you have essentially two timelines worth of characters, plotlines and events to contend with. Thankfully, the game has a simple objective system that not only keeps you focused on what you need to do, but also will clearly state which timeline you need to be in to complete the objective. Also, if you need a reminder&nbsp;on the current goings on, and you can bear to read the cringe of it, Max also keeps a handwritten journal of the story so far.</p>

<p>As another thing to praise about Double Exposure, this game has some of the most robust accessibility options available that I think I’ve ever seen. I only dropped into the Options to mess with the sound levels (I like my music loud and my voices not), and there are so many useful toggles allowing you to make subtitles clearer, add warnings about potentially harmful content or even – a life saver for someone as oblivious like I am – add an auditory chime for when you’re close to interactive areas.</p>
<p>It’s great to see games embrace accessibility generally, but this game should be put up there with the best in this regard for the wealth of considerate options here. Also, the ability to toggle whether you want a clear instruction on whether you want to make a particular decision is another excellent addition for me personally. I haven’t had the problem of previous games of accidentally selecting something then having to live with those consequences.</p>
<p>As is the case with the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure hits a very specific aesthetic, blending lowkey chilled Americana with soft indie rock. The university campus is a fresh location but feels distinctly homely and lived in immediately. The cast might look a little too uncanny at times, but they mostly fit in with the environment perfectly and have some phenomenal voice acting. The music too is excellent, even though not quite as prominent as I would like (or as prevalent as it was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/08/life-is-strange-true-colors-review/">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>).</p>

		<p>Rebellion games have revived a British gaming institution, launching a brand new Speedball into Steam Early Access today! The game has a 12-month roadmap planned out, with a full 1.0 launch coming at the end of this path.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball – Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8nNpqK1GG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rebellion’s Speedball will take the core idea of the game series and give it a modern look and feel. This is still a no-holds-barred amped up blend of American Football, Rugby and Football, with thrown passing between players, blood-spilling takedowns and no sign of a referee, whistle or flag in sight. You can take advantage of the specific arenas with various traps and scenery to try and get the advantage.</p>
<p>The Early Access release will feature arcade matches, with play against AI complimented with both online and local multiplayer. There’s plenty to come, though, with a team management and draft system,&nbsp;player and manager progression, Career Mode, skill-based matchmaking and leaderboards, new cosmetics, skins and arenas and more set to be fed into the game over the coming year.</p>
<p>We just hope there’s the rapid hip-wiggling celebration.</p>

<p>A brutal future sport that puts as much emphasis into beating the ever-loving crap out of your opponents as it does actually scoring goals, Speedball first launched in 1988. A bit like Street Fighter, though, it’s Speedball 2 that everyone actually remembers. That was the game that was ported and remade half a dozen times over the years, whether it was a 3D graphics remake for PlayStation, a more contemporary Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe for Xbox Live Arcade, or the traditional Speedball 2 HD which arrived on Steam over a decade ago now. Rebellion acquired the Bitmap Brothers back catalogue in 2019, with this new take on Speedball one of the first fruits of that acquisition.<sup id="cite_ref-16"></sup></p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for Nintendo Switch, coming out on 30th March 2025 for the game’s 10th anniversary, and removing one more reason to keep you Wii U plugged in… or maybe even to keep it at all!</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Coming March 20th, 2025 (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKHz71V7Csc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition promises to enhance the sci-fi RPG epic on its way to the Switch, with the original game pushing the Wii U to the limits and making certain sacrifices to stick to 30FPS – though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaYfIdZ-_a0">it did manage to hold this target a lot</a>.</p>


<p>The Definitive Edition does also promise some new story elements. It’s not clear what this will be, and could be integrated into the main story alongside other side-missions and quests, or a separate addendum, similar to what we’ve seen with the most recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to other entries in the series, there’s a pretty big tonal shift for Xenoblade Chronicles X, with more of a sci-fi feel, some clashing art styles, and more. The game takes us to the year 2054 with Earth destroyed in the crossfire of an alien war, and just a small number of survivors surviving to make it to the planet Mira. It’s up to you to explore this land as part of BLADE, help found New Los Angeles, and take on online missions and grand multiplayer Global Nemesis Battles for up to 31 players – the online is returning for this Nintendo Switch remaster.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is one of the last major Nintendo Wii U games that will be ported to Nintendo Switch – and quite possibly doing so right around the launch of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/"> the anticipated Switch successor</a>. Pretty much everything else, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/09/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review/">Mario</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">platformers</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review/">Donkey Kong</a>, and even other niche JRPGs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/15/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore</a> have been ported across. At this point, it’s really just the run-of-the-mill sports and Mario RPGs, and games that can only work with the Wii U Gamepad’s second screen that are trapped on the system – your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/04/22/affordable-space-adventures-review/">Affordable Space Adventures</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review/">Star Fox Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review/">Star Fox Guard</a>, Nintendo Land are the last few standouts (for better or worse)</p>
<p>Looking back at the original release and our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X review</a>, Dom said, “Xenoblade Chronicles X is a genuinely enthralling game. It doesn’t take it easy on you though, and the perseverance and attention required may override the spectacle and beauty found here. Fans of the last game may also struggle with the tonal and technical shift, but if you want to experience one of the most involving, creative and expansive open worlds ever created, Xenoblade Chronicles X is essential.”</p>
