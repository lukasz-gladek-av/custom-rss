		<p>Ubisoft have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">set up a new subsidiary</a> within their company which will focus on three&nbsp;core games, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.&nbsp; The set-up also involves $1.25 billion in investment from the French game publisher from Tencent.</p>
<p>Heading up this new take are two fresh-faced individuals ready to bring a new dynamic to Ubi.. oh wait. Scratch that, it’s being headed up by Christophe Derennes who launched the Montreal studio, and has been with the company 35 years, and Charlie <em>“Do you know who my Dad is”</em> Guillemot. Charlie is most famous for running Owlient, which made free to play game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howrse</a> in the late 2010s, and Unagi, which has made four web3 games that <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use NFTS</a>.&nbsp; Sounds just the chap to look after Rainbow Six, maybe they will add horseback combat with some gorgeous NFT horse armour.</p>


<p>We know that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe</a> is on the way along with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Animus hub</a> which will tie together all the games, but we’ve not heard anything about a new Rainbow Six or Far Cry.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>

<p>Rumours of a hostile takeover of Ubisoft appear quite regularly, but so far, the Guillemot family has remained in charge.</p>
