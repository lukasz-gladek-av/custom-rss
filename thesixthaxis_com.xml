		<p>Embark has revealed what’s coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another. There’s a new Cold Snap map condition to endure, and Flickering Flames to warm you up when you get back to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flickering Flames Winter Event | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdGMteCqknE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cold Snap is a new map condition from 16th December, as brutal cold and blizzard can roll in and force you to approach scavengine missions in a different way.</p>
<p>Embark say, “The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.”</p>
<p>And with the difficulties above, Speranza is also having to endure food scarcity and rolling blackouts by gathering in candle light and sharing what little they have. Flickering Flames is the name for this event, which runs from 16th December through 13th January.</p>

<p>You’ve got two new major goals when heading above the surface, looking to gather the Candleberry Bush which sustains the city through the winter, and also light and heat sources to boost morale.</p>
<p>Candleberries and light and heat special items will be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li value="1">Raider Tokens</li>
<li value="2">New items</li>
<li value="3">Rare utility items</li>
<li value="4">Weapons</li>
<li value="5">Cosmetics</li>
<li value="6">Merits</li>
</ul>

<p>And then, as a Christmas treat, the second free and permanent Raider Deck is coming to the game on 26th December. This is a string of items to unlock, Raider Tokens and cosmetics,, building up to the hockey-inspired outfit and hockey stick “tool” of The Goalie.</p>
