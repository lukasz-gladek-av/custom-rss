		<p>Ah, Let it Die. Quite possibly one of the most enigmatic free-to-play games of all time, it’s been 9 years since the original launched on PS4, where it introduced the world to Uncle Death, the Tower of Barbs and its Souls-lite hack and slash combat. It also introduced the world to the idea of paying real money to revive yourself, and while that might not have particularly caught on, the fact that it’s still going nearly a decade later shows that it got a lot of things right. Fans of the series can rejoice then, with the announcement of Let It Die: Inferno, a brand-new, full-price entry in the series that looks to take all those things that the original got right and make them better.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Tower of Barbs is gone, and instead you’re about to embark on a mission into hell, descending through the different levels on the way to… well, I’m not sure yet, since Death appears at the start of the game, and it’s called Let It Die. Perhaps the things it wants you to let die are all the beasts and badniks that get in your way, and from the look of the announcement trailer, there’s going to be plenty of those to send on their way. </p>
<p>Touted as a ‘survival action roguelike’ Let It Die: Inferno is due to launch on the PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on the 3rd of December, 2025. Just like the original game, Let It Die: Inferno is being published by GungHo Online Entertainment, but where that was developed by Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture, the team at Super Trick Games, who span off from the original developers and worked on the short-lived battle royale Deathverse: Let It Die, are once again taking the reins. </p>
<p>It already looks amazing, and seems to mix the characterful combat of the original with a thoroughly modern take on the Roguelike genre, while shifting to Unreal Engine 5 and a full-price release, which should hopefully remedy many player’s number one complaint with the first game. We’ll be checking it out over the next two days at the Tokyo Game Show, and we’ll be sure to let you know how it feels!</p>
