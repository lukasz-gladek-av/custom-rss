		<p>Critical Reflex has announced that the much anticipated multiplayer update for Buckshot Roulette is now available to all players. The development team has said that there are still some issues that were already identified in the multiplayer beta, and are currently working on ways to get those fixed. Creative Reflex is also going to be monitoring player submitted reports for other issues that could crop up.</p>

<p>In its statement, Critical Reflex said, <em>“Now, last time we spoke, we said, quote, “we don’t underestimate the capacity of you, High Rollers, to break games in half”. Turns out, we still sort of did. Here’s the thing: due to the peer-to-peer nature of the multiplayer, we have identified a few issues throughout the beta, so we’re already working on patches and fixes for those. Throughout the coming days we’ll be closely monitoring the community reports and react accordingly, so if you’ve got any thoughts to share — make sure to leave them at the Steam Forums or at our Discord server and we’ll certainly take them into consideration.”</em></p>
<p>Alongside multiplayer, the new Buckshot Roulette update has added brand new items to use, new music, new faces created by the fictional in game company Volta Standard Electronics. Buckshot Roulette is a dark horror card game in which players play Russian Roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. Players enter an arena within a nightclub to go three rounds with the dealer, and only one of you will survive.</p>
