		<p>Shrimp Industries has released a brand new trailer for Roll The Bones, which is described as dice rolling action roguelite in a fantasy setting. Oh, and there is some bullet hell mixed in there for good measure too. You can see all of this chaos in the trailer below which also shows some of the dice action that makes up the core of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Roll The Bones - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hDAL7Gjm1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Roll The Bones players can use customisable spell dice, which can have a different spell on each face, to take on the hand crafted dungeons alongside the challenge floors. The dice can also be upgraded with new materials which will alter spells and their impact on critical rolls. Additionally, certain combos will trigger the Artifacts which can further alter how a run goes in Roll The Bones. Artifacts can add burn effects or trigger meteor strikes.</p>
<p>Shrimp Industries is aiming to release Roll The Bones later this year for PC, with PS5 and Xbox Series XS ports expected further down the line.</p>
