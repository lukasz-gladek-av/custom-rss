<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 expands massively on the original game, with powerwashing just being one of the activities in the game. The town of Muckingham &nbsp;will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham. There will be additional locations to explore too including &nbsp;Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. You will have access to new tools including an abseiling rig and cherry picker to reach those hard to reach spots.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator 2 preview, Stefan said, <em>“There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.”</em></p>

		<p>Redemption Road Games has delayed Kingmakers just before its anticipated early access release date of October 8th, and the studio has not stated when the game is now expected to release. This is the second delay for Kingmakers, which was originally scheduled for early access in Q1 2025. If you need a refresher of what Kingmakers is, it is a game where you go 500 years back in time, fighting in a medieval battle to change the course of history using modern weapons and tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Redemption Road Games said, <em>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch of October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating the game. We are sorry for letting you down. Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</em></p>
<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles, where every room can be entered, and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore- with or without their thousands of soldiers. We set out to do all of this, with full drop in/drop out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So this is what we’re doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top of the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days. Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it. We will be presenting a half hour long deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.”</em></p>
