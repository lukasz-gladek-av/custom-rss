		<p>Last month, Not Knowing Software and Microprose confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/cleared-hot-has-got-an-early-access-release-date-for-november/">Cleared Hot</a> was going to be released on November 20th into early access. Today, the development team has released Cleared Hot’s early access roadmap, allowing players to see what content to expect and how updates will be delivered. No dates have been given aside from the release of Chapter 1 through Early Access, as the team will use community feedback to work on improvements before releasing additional content.</p>



<p>Cleared Hot Chapter 1 will give players access to the Texas biome and eight playable helicopters. This will be followed by Chapter 1b, adding side missions, another helicopter, improved controls, and helicopter skins. Chapter 2 is called Into the Jungle which will add the jungle biome, new enemies, and more customisation options for helicopters. This will be followed by Chapter 3, called The Final Chapter, which will see levels in the Arctic and urban areas. The release of Chapter 3 will also add Steam Trading cards and achievements. After that Cleared Hot will get its full 1.0 launch.</p>
<p>Cleared Hot will launch at a price of $14.99, with a 10% launch discount, but the price will rise as more content is added to the game. If you do not know about Cleared Hot, think of it as a new take on classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike.</p>
