		<p>PIONER is going to be launching into Steam Early Access on December 16th, GFAGames has confirmed following the game’s open beta. Those who purchase the PIONER Deluxe Edition will get three weapon skins, a creepy keychain accessory, a Founder title, the Renegade outfit, and the Katana watch accessory. Those who took part in the open beta will also get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals.</p>

<p>When the PIONER open beta ended, GFAGames did state that there would be a further stress test to address the issues and bugs that players experienced. In a statement at the time, the team said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort.&nbsp;<wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release.&nbsp;<wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand.</p>

		<p>StarRupture will be having a co-op playtest running from December 3rd to December 8th, Creepy Jar has announced. The co-op playtest will run continuously through these dates so players can try out what is on offer as much as they want. There is also no NDA so everything can be shared, and joining the StarRupture playtest is as simple as heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture Steam page</a> and clicking the request access button.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture Co-op Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDfmyjbHKWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Creepy Jar has stated that the those who choose to play the StarRupture playtest will give acces to an early part of the game, the single player tutorial, and a free play option which will give limited access to StarRupture’s map. Bugs have been addressed since the July single player playtest, and performance has also been improved. Creepy Jar also wants players to not worry about spoilers as plenty of content is being held back for its Early Access release.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

<p>StarRupture will launch on January 6th, 2026 into Steam Early Access.</p>

		<p>Dead By Daylight has been given a brand new update by Behaviour Interactive, bringing the game up to update 9.3.0. The update re-enables the Mindbreaker perk, but has disabled the Breakdown and Wicked perks. Another new major change applies to the Hook with a Resolve Bar being made visible to other Survivors while being hooked. There are also more balance changes, plus changes for both Killers and Survivors. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>
<h2>Dead By Daylight 9.3.0 Mid-Chapter update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Mindbreaker perk has been re-enabled.<wbr></li>
<li>The Breakdown and Wicked perks have been disabled.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Quality of Life</b><wbr></p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>The Resolve Bar is now visible to other Survivors while hooked.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To help bridge the information gap between players using voice chat and those who aren’t, we’ve added the Resolve Bar to the HUD. This will help Survivors determine if the Killer is camping and plan their next move accordingly.</i></p>
<p><wbr><b>Balance</b><wbr><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Anti-Facecamp meter now fills faster based on how long the Killer stays near the hook:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>0-10 seconds: 1x speed<wbr></li>
<li>10-20 seconds: 2x speed<wbr></li>
<li>&gt;20 seconds: 4x speed<wbr></li>
<li><i>Note: This multiplier only accumulates when the Killer is considered camping (the meter is gaining progress). The multiplier resets when the Survivor is unhooked.</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decreased the base fill rate of the Anti-Facecamp meter by roughly 50% to compensate.<wbr></li>
<li>Hooking a Survivor now applies a 7 second grace period to all hooked Survivors&nbsp;<i>(was only the last hooked Survivor)</i>.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To make the Anti-Facecamp mechanic fairer to both sides, we’ve reduced the base fill rate and added the time the Killer remains near the hook as a modifier. This gives Killers who are not camping more freedom to pass by a hook (particularly in cramped spaces like hallways) without worrying about the meter filling and giving the Survivor a free escape. This also means that Survivors who are being camped for extended periods gain the ability to unhook themselves slightly earlier.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Unhook Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survivors gain 10% Haste and Endurance for 15 seconds after being unhooked&nbsp;<i>(was 10)</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Decreased the time for crows to appear to 80/100/120 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 120/140/190)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Following the release of the updated AFK crow system, we increased the time it took to gain crows. This was much too generous, allowing for Survivors to avoid crows too easily. We’re dialing back the values a little bit to a middle ground between the original values and the live values.</i></p>


<p><b>The Shape</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slaughtering Strike’s camera controls are now identical to regular camera controls.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Skull Merchant</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the Drone Rotation speed to 105 degrees/second&nbsp;<i>(was 95 degrees/second).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the Hindered status effect from getting scanned to 10%&nbsp;<i>(was 8%).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Deploy Drone cooldown to 7 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 10 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Undetectable duration after deploying a Drone to 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 8 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the fast vault immunity to Scan Lines.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every 2.5 seconds spent standing underneath a Drone, the Survivor gains 1 Lock On&nbsp;<i>(was instant).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased Killer detection range for the Drone&nbsp;<i>(now only rises when colliding directly with The Skull Merchant)</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: The Skull Merchant has dropped fairly significantly in terms of kill rate and lethality. These buffs aim to make her Drones a bigger threat and bring her up a little bit. Additionally, we’ve decreased the cooldown to deploying drones, and consequently decreased the duration of Undetectable to keep some downtime between her Undetectable status effect. When standing underneath a Drone, Survivors would get instant Lock On, which felt like a bug whenever it happened. The gradual increase of Lock On will feel more natural and provide feedback to the Survivor that something bad is happening to them. Lastly, we reduced the Drone’s sensitivity to their mistress, to make sure they are always ready to scan Survivors during chases in tight spaces and don’t ascend unintentionally.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Original Pain (The Cenobite):</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a Survivor breaks free from a Possessed Chain, reveal their aura for 8 seconds&nbsp;<i>(rework).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Soma Family Photo (The Singularity):</b><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Slipstreaming a Survivor inflicts the Hindered&nbsp;status effect for 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 3 seconds).</i><wbr></li>
<li>Inflicts the Deep Wound status effect if the Survivor is injured&nbsp;<i>(removed).</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Both of these add-ons were notorious for their ability to disable the Endurance status effect Survivors get when they are unhooked. These changes aim to remove this ability to bypass the protection post-unhook.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Conviction:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated perk to require specifically healing another Survivor&nbsp;<i>(to prevent infinite interaction with Plot Twist).</i><wbr></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Re-added the ability to recover while crawling.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Haste effect to 30/40/50%&nbsp;<i>(was 15/20/25).</i></li>

<p><b>Anti-Exhaustion Syringe&nbsp;</b><i>(renamed Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe)</i>:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Removed the heal over time effect.<wbr></li>
<li>Removes Exhaustion on use&nbsp;<i>(rework).</i><wbr></li>
<li>Consumes the med-kit on Secondary Action use.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Styptic Agent:</b><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Removed the Endurance status effect.<wbr></li>
<li>No longer consumes the med-kit on Secondary Action use.<wbr></li>
<li>Increases the efficiency when healing yourself by 15%&nbsp;<i>(rework).</i><wbr><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chase Start<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased Bloodpoint amount to 500&nbsp;<i>(was 400)</i>.<wbr></p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooking Survivor<wbr></p>

<li>
<p>Increased Bloodpoint amount to 500&nbsp;<i>(was 200)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: With the above changes to hook improvements, we thought it was the right time to raise a few Score Events to encourage Killers to spread first hooks earlier in the match.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Pallet Density Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed all pallet tiles to evaluate and reduce the safety of pallet loops on MacMillan Estate, Asylum, The Red Forest, Yamaoka Estate, Haddonfield and Mount Ormond Resort.<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the spawn logic of certain structures (i.e. the main building in Disturbed Ward; the piers in Backwater Swamp) to better randomize items and balance the distance between windows and pallets. This also impacts The Red Forest<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the Crotus Prenn Asylum Realm, reducing the safety of the main building which could spawn near maze tiles and chain into other tiles.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: After collecting feedback from the community on the recent pallet density update, we made the above changes to address some of the most notable friction points. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts on its initial iteration and do let us know what you think of these changes.</i><wbr></p>

<li>We’ve introduced a fog effect across the map.<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve reworked the overall lighting and adjusted the hue of the Realm to improve visual clarity.</li>
