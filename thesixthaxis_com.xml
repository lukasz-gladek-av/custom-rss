<p>Set in the North of England in the 1960s, the game’s story branches off from reality following the Windscale fire, the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history at the nuclear plant now known as Sellafield. Following the fallout from the fire, the surrounding area has been put into quarantine, a grand coverup, it seems, for some other mysterious events. The whole quarantine zone has fallen into decay, with crashed helicopters and rusted out cars, while the locals in Windham village are monitored by Protocol – a military group sent in to manage the rescue and help operation. They come with more modern weaponry, and have towering 1950s sci-fi style robots equipped with machine guns and flamethrowers to keep order and patrol both the village and abandoned underground bunkers of BARD – locations key to unpeeling the mystery of the game’s world.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live for both the standard edition of Atomfall and the Deluxe Edition. The Deluxe Edition will include the base game, three days early access, a basic supply bundle, an enhanced supply bundle, and access to the first story expansion which will launch at a later date. No details have yet been released about the content of the story expansion. The standard edition is priced at £44.99 while the Atomfall Deluxe Edition is priced at £64.99. Those who pre-order the standard edition will also get the basic supply bundle.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4.</p>
