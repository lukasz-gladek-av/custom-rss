		<p>Koei Tecmo has announced and released a demo for its monster hunting game Wild Hearts S on Switch 2, ahead of the game’s release on July 25th. The Wild Hearts S demo consists of the first area of the game, called Haragasumi Way, and it can be played either solo or in multiplayer for up to four players to hunt together. You can grab the demo by heading to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/WILD-HEARTS-S-2848001.html#">WILD HEARTS S page&nbsp;</a>on Nintendo’s site, or on the Switch 2 store.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the Wild Hearts S demo, players can wander around all of Haragusumi Way, experiment with the different karakuri tools that get unlocked, and find the tsumoko robots that can assist in battle. There are also different weapons to forge and upgrade while in the area, so you can figure out what the best weapon style is for you from wielding the starter katana to other things like a giant hammer, and a deadly umbrella. If you are planning to get the full release of Wild Hearts S it is definitely worth jumping into the demo as all progress will carry over to the main game.</p>

<p>In our Wild Hearts review, Dom said, <em>“Wild Hearts has proved to be an immense surprise. It navigates the line between well-worn ground and exciting new innovation immensely well. It’s the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had, and a hugely enjoyable action RPG in its own right.”</em></p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that they are ending the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> subscribers, removing them from sale on 30th January 2026.</p>
<p>Any vouchers purchased prior to the end of the programme will still be valid for use for the usual 12 months before they expire, but no further vouchers will be sold after 11:59 PM in your local market on 30th January 2026. So the vouchers will last until 30th January 2027.</p>


<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were introduced as part of Nintendo Switch Online, a popular way of getting Nintendo’s games at a discount, outside of rare sale periods. Purchased in a pair for $100 / £84, you could then redeem these vouchers against two games from a curated catalogue of titles. With games often priced at $60 / £50, this could net a combined saving of $20 / £16. Potentially even more, as the £60 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a part of the program, and the new and upcoming titles, such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, can also be included.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for this program when Nintendo announced increased game prices for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers can only be redeemed against Switch games, as it stands, so the aforementioned Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Tears of the Kingdom would then need a further upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The value of the offer can also be seen to be diminishing for savvy gamers who are happy to wait for Nintendo to put parts of their back catalogue on sale. At those times, games can drop to around £30, which is obviously a much larger discount.</p>
