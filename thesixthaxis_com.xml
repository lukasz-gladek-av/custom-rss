		<p>11 bit Studios has released a brand new trailer for the console version of Frostpunk 2, which shows how the development team has adapted the game for controller use. The console version of Frostpunk 2 will make use of radial menus for a lot of aspects of the game, including construction of the city, decision making, and exploration. The user interface has been designed so console players can easily navigate the menus and options that make up the gameplay of Frostpunk 2, and you can see it in action below.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the events of the original Frostpunk, taking players into the age of oil and all of the issues that come with that, both technological as your society moves on from coal and social strife that will divide the inhabitants.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a>&nbsp;game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a>&nbsp;<em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</em></p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September,</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that it will be raising the prices of the PlayStation 5 consoles in the US. While Sony does not give the reasons why, it is likely to do with the the tariffs that the US Government has brought in over the past several months, which has caused prices to rise across various goods for consumers in the country. The full statement from Sony is as follows.</p>
<p><em>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</em></p>


<p><em>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em></p>

<p>As stated the price rises come in tomorrow, August 21st so if you are in the US and were waiting to get a PS5 now is probably the best time to get your order in.</p>
