		<p>New studio Intima Leaf, founded by developers Aymen Menjli and Mehdi Baccouche, has announced its first game called Riven Crown. It has been described as a mix of a Soulslike and a fighting game, with Intima Leaf giving the game the description of a Souls Fighter. Before we get into that you can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>

<p>Now, back to the phrase “Souls Fighter”. The main element of Riven Crown’s gameplay is that of a soulslike title, an action RPG with tough enemies to face. However, where Riven Crown differs is with its combat and combo system. Each weapon in Riven Crown has its own library of combos to learn and master, and putting those combos together to build up a meter to enter a Super State. In this state, combat becomes fast paces and the dodge roll is replaced with a swift dodge. The super combos will require to master both input sequences and timings to pull off each weapon’s combos. Along with attacks, players will also have to master both the standing and crouching block systems. Mistime a block and enemies will have an opening to strike.</p>

<p>Riven Crown tells the tale of a fallen hero who awakens in a mysterious new dimension, where four ancient civilizations stand, but they have been tainted by corruption. Kings and Queens ruled these civilisations but have succumbed to darkness, becoming demons known as the Deep Samum. Those who lived in these civilisations have become victims of the corruption and have turned into hell beasts that will attack the player.&nbsp; A separate faction of humans has also emerged in this chaos and it is governed by a Council of Elders. This council use dark magic to create the Bark Aggregation, an element that grants humans superpowers.</p>

</div>
<p>Riven Crown is said to last between 25 to 35 hours, with plenty to explore across the corrupted civilisations and plenty of fights to get into. The experience of Riven Crown will not just be limited to the game either. Intima Leaf has stated it will be running a cipher minigame with weekly challenges being presented, and real life prizes being put up for grabs.
