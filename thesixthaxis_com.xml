            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/control-update-will-add-hdr-and-ps4-exclusive-mission-for-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a big update for Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>, available now on PC and coming soon to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, that is bringing graphical improvements like HDR support, and making a previously PlayStation exclusive mission available for all platforms.</p>
<p>Available now on Steam and Epic, and with the GOG version to follow later, PC gamers are now able to take advantage of HDR support, 10-bit SDR support, support for up to 48:9 monitors – a ridiculously wide ratio – and a new Ultra ray tracing preset that increases the number of rays per pixel and gives higher temporal stability.</p>


<p>That last point goes hand in hand with, not only much better GPUs than were available in 2019, but also greater DLSS support. This has been updated to DLSS 3.7, includes DLAA support for more anti-aliasing and other tweaks and fixes. While it is possible to mod games with DLSS support to use AMD’s most recent FSR 4 instead, it would be good to see native support for FSR 4 down the line.</p>
<p>Additionally, all players will now have access to the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, which features voiceover by Hideo Kojima. Previously exclusive to the PS4 Digital Deluxe version of Control, anyone can now play it by picking up the first Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in&nbsp; the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector.</p>
<p>A subset of all this will be coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Control Ultimate Edition. HDR and improved SDR colour range will be the baseline improvement, but we could also see more bespoke PS5 Pro support with ray tracing enhancements. That would be pretty neat.</p>

<p>Remedy note that it’s a small team working on supporting this game, os they’re taking things slowly to avoid introducing bugs and problems as much as possible.</p>
<h3>OUTFITS</h3>
<p>The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)</p>
<h3>MISSIONS</h3>
<p>All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<h3>GRAPHICS</h3>
<p>Added HDR support<br>
Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability<br>
Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors<br>
Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera<br>
Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding<br>
Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12<br>
Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors<br>
Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus<br>
Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K<br>
Implemented texture streaming fixes<br>
Ray tracing bug fixes</p>
<h3>DLSS SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Added DLSS support for arbitrary resolutions<br>
Added DLAA support<br>
Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability<br>
Film grain added back to DLSS SR<br>
Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled<br>
Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</p>
<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p>Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn’t intended to be heard. (It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)<br>
Several bug and crash fixes</p>

		<p>Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is heading into Steam Early Access on 2nd April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year</a>, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games with World of Tanks, World of Warships and more. This free-to-play mech hero shooter blends together battle royale and extraction shooter ideas, and Wargaming are hoping that early access will help them to quickly refine that blend, with the expectation that they will quickly get to a full release after gathering community feedback. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/steel-hunters-open-beta-brings-stompy-off-on-steam/">This will build on what they learnt from closed beta</a> periods held over the last few months.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>
<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game when it launches in April… or both!</p>
