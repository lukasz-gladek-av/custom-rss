		<p>Rebellion know more than anyone how satisfying it is to blow the nuts off a Nazi. While that might not particularly trailer-friendly fare, it’s safe to say we all know that’s the first thing that anyone is doing when Sniper Elite: Resistance launches on the 30th of January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. The second thing you might want to do is indulge in some of the all-new features that Rebellion are bringing to bear in this entry in the storied series, with a fresh new trailer here to give a deeper dive into them all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfhRzW2lUfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, there’s a new Operative in the shape of Harry Hawker – excellent alliteration there – and an all-new threat for you to overcome, and you can enjoy shooting Nazi’s in whatever body part you choose in either solo or online co-op. Bring a friend, then you can shoot Nazi’s in two places.</p>
<p>There’s also the new Propoganda missions, which are individually unlocked by discovering Propaganda posters hidden within the main Campaign. This new game mode lets you play as a Resistance fighter in thrilling quick-fire challenges against the clock and they look very cool indeed.</p>
<p>This is currently the only aspect of the game that we haven’t been able to check out, as Tef has been hands-on with it at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">Gamescom ’24</a> and at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-spending-the-night-in-lyon/">another event</a>. He came away suitably impressed, calling it “Stealth action comfort food”, before continuing, “Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.”</p>

<p>So there you have it. Watch the trailer, find your comrade, and prepare to shoot some Nazis in the nuts on the 30th of January, 2025.</p>
