		<p>Frogwares has released the first proper gameplay for The Sinking City 2, alongside the launch of the game’s Kickstarter campaign. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2 was announced</a> in March last year following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/the-sinking-city-publishing-rights-now-fully-controlled-by-frogwares/">Frogwares successful bid</a> at securing the publishing rights to The Sinking City. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">The Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> has a goal of $105,000, with the funds primarily being used as a safety net for the studio, as Frogwares is based in Ukraine.</p>

<p><em>“After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</em> , said Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares.</p>
<p>In addition to the teaser, there is also a five minute deep dive into the game and the new direction of putting horror first, though The Sinking City 2 will also retain some of the investigative style of the first game.</p>

<p>The story of The Sinking City 2 will see you in Arkham, a city that is falling under the waves that you can explore on foot and in a boat. There are mansions and abandoned hospitals that will hold all sorts of mysteries and dangers. There will be 1920s styled weapons available but resources will be scarce, and the inventory will be very limited so you will have to decide on what to keep hold of, and what to ditch. There will be plenty of mysteries to discover and solve, with many being morally grey so no choice will be too easy. The Sinking City 2 is due to release this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
