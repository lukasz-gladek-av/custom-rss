<hr>
<p>Once again, 2025 has been a years filled with challenges for people all through the country and the world, and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With the deep impact of wars continuing to be felt in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we can only hope for peace and resolution and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>

<p>If you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, while Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, it can also bring up difficult memories. If you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support. You can reach them via the above links or at the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samaritans – call 116 123</li>
<li>Shout – text SHOUT to 85258</li>
<li>Childline – call 0800 1111 between 7:30 and 3:30pm every day</li>
<li>Mind – call their infoline on 0300 123 3393</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s so many different charities and causes out there that you can support and,&nbsp;if you’re in a position to do so, we would encourage you to do just that.</p>
