		<p>Last year, Starward Industries announced the disaster survival adventure Dante’s Ring, but today the studio has confirmed a renaming of its project alongside a new trailer. Dante’s Ring is no more with that name being replaced by Into The Fire. The name aptly fits the game as you play as a firefighter on the volcanic area of <span>Dante’s Archipelago, with the mission to save as many people as possible while also dealing with demons. Into The Fire will be coming to Steam Early Access later this year.</span></p>

<p>Into The Fire’s trailer shows just how high stakes everything is. The game’s fire replicates real fire in the way it quickly spreads and consumes things in its path for fuel. With your limited resources, including a fire axe and water, you will need to think on your feet to figure out the best path forward to save those trapped by the flames, while also dealing with the otherworldly influence of the fiery demons that are thriving in this environment. You will be armed with other unique tools including a shotgun that can extinguish flames. Maybe that will help with the pesky demons too. The terrain is not going to be easy to navigate but you will have different modes of transport including a sled and an acid resistant boat.&nbsp; When not in a disaster zone, you will be monitoring things from the Hub. The Hub is your command centre where you will get information, upgrade gear, and plan the rescues using data including seismographs. It will also be a place to rest and take stock of the events you have come across, peeling back the layers to understand the secrets of Dante’s Archipelago.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/the-invincible-review/">The Invincible Review</a></h2>
<p>Starward Industries last game was The Invincible, and in our review I said, <em>“The Invincible is a novel brought to life, blending its story and stunning visuals with engaging exploration. The Invincible goes back to the roots of sci-fi, offering something both classic and new when it comes to exploring the relationship between humanity and the final frontier.”</em></p>
