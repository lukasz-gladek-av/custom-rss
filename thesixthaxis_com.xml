		<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/">dealabs.com</a> has got the scoop on one of the games coming to PS Plus January 2026. According to their sources, the main title for January will be Need for Speed: Unbound on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Need for Speed Unbound - Speed Race Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBPZapIh4MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Criterion developed the game and it was published in 2022 by EA, and when it was released we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/05/need-for-speed-unbound-review/">9/10 in our review</a>, calling it “the best arcade racer of 2022”. Since then it has had multiple updates but support for the game ended in in 2024 when Criterion moved on to help make Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 title is the PS5 version as Sony&nbsp; announced that January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>

<p><em>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 games should be officially revealed later today on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/">PlayStation Blog.&nbsp;</a></p>
