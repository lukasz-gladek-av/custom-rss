		<p>Konami, Evil Empire and Motion Twin have announced Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse, an all-new 2D side-scrolling metroidvania that will release this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Castlevania: Belmont‘s Curse Announcement Trailer (ESRB) | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3k9Yy-o6tpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set more than two decades after Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse, Belmont’s Curse is set in 15th century Paris. The whip has been passed on to Trevor Belmont’s successor, who must head out into the city and battle monstrous creatures, heading into a mystical castle and threatens to doom Paris to eternal darkness.</p>
<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of the Castlevania series, and so it’s a massively fan-pleasing announcement to see a new 2D game announced, and then to have such highly regarded developers behind it. Original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a> studio Motion Twin is here in an advisory role, while their successor studio at Evil Empire are the main developers alongside Konami on Belmont’s Curse. Evil Empire was founded in 2019 to continue to support Dead Cells, but since wrapping up that game’s DLC in 2023, moved on to adapt <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> as a roguelite, which hit its full release last year.</p>
<p>Evil Empire are no strangers to Castlevania, though. The fourth and final expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/13/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review/">Dead Cells was Return to Castlevania</a>, arriving in 2023 with characters, weapons and enemies licensed from the Castlevania series. With a working relationship already established, and that DLC well-received, they’re getting a second crack of the whip at the franchise. What’s interesting is that, where Dead Cells and TRPOP were both rougelites, this is described as a “2D Action-Exploration”, implying a more traditional metroidvania. One to keep an eye on, that’s for sure.</p>

		<p>It’s a funny old time isn’t it? After last night’s State of Play, it’s got me thinking about how we find out about all of those lovely games we’re going to be playing. It used to be practically once-yearly, the industry taking over LA for E3, and a blast of information that you’d pore over for months afterwards. Now, though, there’s practically an E3-like wealth of knowledge every week thanks to a Nintendo Direct here, a State of Play there, oh, and of course, Geoff’s TGA trailer extravaganza. As gamers, we’ve never been closer to developers and publishers, learning all the intricacies of a game before it even arrives, and in some ways, that’s good, but, as with everything now, there’s something to be said for a good old surprise. Thankfully, we still get those, and Sony pulled that off with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-and-god-of-war-son-of-sparta-out-now/">God of War Son of Sparta</a> last night!</p>

<p>While I’ll be giving that a go later, this week I’ve spent a lot of time hatching eggs. Monster eggs. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-preview-ecology-and-environmentalism-thrive-in-capcoms-latest/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is already doing a lot of things better than its predecessors, and I think Capcom may have another big hit on their hands at this early stage in the year. Besides that, I played Citadelum on the Switch 2 and enjoyed the magic of Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, while getting involved in Dosas Divas and Earth Must Die too.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> was the first to show her face, but she did so in the kitchen, brandishing a wrench, which was a bit disconcerting. That’s because she’s been reviewing Clue: Murder By Death, which you’ll see a review about shortly. She also cheated the Wolf Spirit bosses in Spirit of the North 2, “by sitting my fox on a wall where the attacks couldn’t hit me. I stayed there all the way through while the wolves huffed and puffed and I occasionally popped down to get a hit in when they got tired. I probably wasn’t supposed to do it that way but it was much less stressful!”</p>
<p>It was the reviews train for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review/">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> and the new Styx stealth ’em up, adding Halls of Torment to the mix. Coming down from the high of reviewing and playing Nioh 3, <strong>Jason</strong> put time into Hordes of Hunger, “which is fine”, and a lot more into Heretical, “which is amazing”. He also made a start on Mewgenics, the new game from the maker of Binding of Isaac, but he’s not sold on either its humour or playstyle.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> gaming this week was all about the gruesome platforming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/">Reanimal</a>, which he was filled with praise for in his review.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> returned to the 2010s with Red Dead Redemption’s remaster. “I originally played it at launch back in 2010 and it’s fair to say that I didn’t have as much of an appreciation for the story and setting that I do now that I’m (slightly) more mature. Given its age, I was also worried that it would feel a little too dated, especially given how busy open world games are nowadays. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at just how much I’m enjoying it. Turning off the auto-aim has certainly helped to make the gunplay more engaging, something that has always felt lacking in Rockstar’s games.”</p>
<p>He’s wrapped up Star Wars Outlaws this week, so <strong>Aran</strong> will be trying to convince you it’s a cosy game in a blog this weekend. He’s since moved on to The Expanse Telltale Series, “which is decent but suffers as a prequel, as none of the events are mentioned again in the show that I can remember.” So he’s also started&nbsp;Like A Dragon Gaiden The Man Who Erased His Name, and is enjoying getting back into the Yakuza world.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> played Arknight Endfield, which sounds to me like a shonky Batman game knock off, but he’s impressed by it: “A lot of new gacha games feel like they’re just vehicles to get you to spend money, but this one really takes its time just letting you play an interesting game for the sake of playing it. Soooo much Death Stranding style and vibes and even gameplay mechanics in it, too. I’m a fan!”</p>
<p>Having bounced around various genres with Mario Tennis Fever, Under the Island, The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest, and Crisol: Theatre of Idols, <strong>Steve</strong> has embraced the 90s nostalgia of &nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom and Rage, and is passing an eye across Steam Next Fest demos while waiting for Resident Evil Requiem.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> been getting into High on Life 2, which has much the same tone as the original game, but has evolved its bizarre riffing on the first person shooter genre.</p>

		<p>Sony and Arc System Works have announced that the release date for their upcoming fighting game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> will launch on 6th August 2026 for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Oh, they also revealed some more characters, too…</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - Unbreakable X-Men Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4C_0Yf43fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Unbreakable X-Men will feature in Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls. This team of mutant heroes has been assembled with Storm as their leader, and the endlessly popular Wolverine. Joining them is the young mutant Magik, who can use both magic and her Soulsword, and the now autonomous AI of the Danger Room, Danger.</p>
<p>The X-Men’s appearance will tie into a new narrative mode that Arc System Works is creating in collaboration with Marvel Games. They’ve adapted the narrative, world and characters specifically for this game, blending together the comics and manga, and collaborating with an as-yet-unnamed writer to do so.</p>

<p>The story will be presented as motion comics, featuring full voice acting across&nbsp;English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin American Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.</p>
