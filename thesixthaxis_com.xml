		<p>If you like Helldivers then I recommend you keep an hour free to watch For Liberty! which is a new fan-made film based on Helldivers 2. It is exceptionally professional with spectacular animation and a rousing score that features familiar-sounding riffs.</p>
<p>It’s also very funny and captures the expandability of the Helldivers along with the fascist regime hiding under the name of Managed Democracy. There’s even a little Drag Race reference which I was not expecting.</p>


<p>For Liberty! finds the Helldivers on a planet where the Automatons are conducting experiments on the Terminids and creating cyborg bugs, but for what reason? The plot follows a female Helldiver as they investigate what is going and, of course, kill an awful lot of robots and bugs. It also cleverly uses the first person perspective from the game for a dramatic key moment, and like all good franchise films, teases a sequel right at the very end of the credits.</p>
<p>You can watch the entire movie below, but if you like it go and give them a like and follow on YouTube where you can find out more about the film.</p>

A Helldivers Film (Full Movie)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7nXj34kwIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a huge hit for Sony with an<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/"> Xbox X|S version launching this yea</a>r. On December 2nd 2025 the Python Commandos Premium Warbond will launch with three brand new stratagems and a new primary weapon. The new gun, a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. It’s “heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one!”</p>

<p>You will also get the M-1000 Maxigun is belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, and there’s a new Guard Dog assistant, this one is armed with a flamethrower. There is new armour, new emotes, new capes and all the usual cosmetic bobbins.</p>
<p>Alongside For Liberty! there is also an official Helldivers film<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/"> on the way</a>. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, but there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>
