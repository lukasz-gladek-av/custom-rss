		<p>One More Level, the development studio behind the Ghostrunner games, has released a brand new gameplay trailer for Valor Mortis. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs/">Valor Mortis is a first person soulslike</a>, and it was annouced by the development team back in August. The new gameplay trailer, which is approximately a minute long, shows the main character William, a resurrected soldier from Napoleon’s army, using melee weapons, fire, and guns to take on all sorts of horrors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis | Gameplay Trailer - The Crimson Plague" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjGtfrFmxxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis will take historical figures from Napoleon’s time and see them twisted into horrors, in a world where plague has consumed Europe but whose powers you can control. As this is a soulslike you will die over and over again in Valor Mortis, but each time you could get stronger by learning new skills and abilities, as well as working out how you need to take advantage of openings to take out the most dangerous of foes. The first playtest for Valor Mortis has concluded and that saw a culmination of 515,000 player deaths and 3 million enemy kills.</p>
<p>Valor Mortis is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
