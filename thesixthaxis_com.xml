		<p>Stellar Blade shattered expectations when it arrived as a PlayStation 5 exclusive last year. Despite being the debut console title from Korean gacha game developer Shift-up, the game was knocking it out of the park with striking gameplay, incredible music, and gorgeous high-definition visuals that stood confidently alongside Sony’s first-party heavy hitters like God of War and Spider-man. The fervor around an eventual PC port of this game has been bustling since it released. As someone who only ever played a demo of the original PlayStation 5 release, this PC port combined with it’s bundled assortment of crossover DLC served as my wake-up call to finally dive in. And across my desktop PC and my Steam Deck OLED, Stellar Blade has impressed me on every level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The graphics and display options on offer here are comparable to other Sony PC ports in how exhaustive and detailed the list of settings to tweak are. Resolution scaling will be set to either NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-FSR-TECH-PREVIEW.html">FSR 4</a> or FSR 3, depending on the GPU you use. FSR 3 is the universal option, comparable to the upscaling used on PS5, while FSR 4 is closer to DLSS in how it works and exclusive to the new Radeon RX 9000 GPUs.</p>


<p>With upscaling enabled, the game raced to an average 90-100 FPS when played at 1440P with max graphics settings on my GeForce RTX 3080. A couple cutscenes full of lots of monsters would cause minor dips, but they were rare and I never felt like the resolution scaling was a distraction. This can even be combined with DLSS frame generation, the game easily hit smooth framerates without major graphical downgrades.</p>


<p>What blew me away, though, was that even with resolution scaling turned completely off, the game was able to maintain a locked 60FPS at 1440P nearly the entire time. As is typicaly, the RTX 3080 easily outperforms every base PlayStation 5 graphics mode, which relied on scaling solutions to hit those targets. Playing any new games at 4K and a steady FPS feels like a pipe dream unless you’ve got a beefy rig or generate half your frames, but Stellar Blade shows a level of optimisation that so few AAA games nowadays do.</p>
<p>Even better, this all means the game is great on Steam Deck. So many recent Sony PC ports require a lot of visual compromise to just barely run on the Valve’s handheld PC, but Stellar Blade feels like it was made for this form factor. The game stays at a steady framerate and maintains a shocking amount of it’s original visual detail and quality.</p>

<p>Packed in alongside the base game content is a duology of crossover DLC with other games that carry a similar thematic through-line of “if android, why hot?” – Square Enix’s&nbsp;Nier Automata&nbsp;an Shift-up’s own title&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory.&nbsp;Both DLC are more a collection of easter eggs and bonus activities than they are a massive expansion or story continuation. If you’re a fan of either property though, the amount of references and call-backs and familiar costumes tossed in from each game are a delight. The&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory&nbsp;DLC in particular, which launched alongside this port, includes a new fishing mini-game, a cover-shooter mission series replicating the gameplay from the fanservice-filled gacha game, and an entire new boss fight against a major character from that title. My only complaint? No love for my favorite&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;character, Elegg. BOOM is life.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade&nbsp;is incredible on PC, and doesn’t compromise at all on any of the quality from the original PlayStation 5 release. For existing fans, the upgrades in resolution and framerate potential are a revelation and the new&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;dlc is a blast. For those who haven’t played the game yet, this is easily the most accessible and versatile way to check it out.</p>

		<p>It’s been a long and busy week, with last weekend being a mad juggle of trying to play as much Switch 2 as possible while also covering Summer Game Fest streams and showcases. The Switch 2 gaming has continued through to this week, as Dom and I led the charge on doing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">a broad look at backward compatibility games</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077’s impressive port</a>, and I published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/">hardware review</a> after gathering my thoughts from the first week.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty more Switch 2 stuff to do, though. I’ll soon be telling you about how the Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a “transfigurational” port. Can you tell that I’m happy with this reference?</p>

<p>For some reason, I asked everyone to tell me relay their week’s gaming while making it rhyme. Not everyone was up to the task, but we did get some nice poems.</p>
<p>Here’s <strong>Ade</strong>:</p>

<p><em>For review I played Alter, and I didn’t falter. It was very hard, like frozen lard, but I saw it through to the end, and confirm that money on it people should spend.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> was more of a limerick:</p>
<p><em>I played Switch 2 with my wife</em><br>
<em>I thought to myself ‘what a life!’</em><br>
<em>But I didn’t let her win</em><br>
<em>My Switch 2 is in the bin</em><br>
<em>Who knew Mario Kart causes such strife?</em></p>
<p>And here’s <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> effort:</p>
<p><em>I start by playing Balatro,</em><br>
<em>Then Warhammer, I’m sure you know,</em><br>
<em>But then I remembered a review,</em><br>
<em>That is what I should do,</em><br>
<em>So I looked at Baldur’s Gate and said no!</em></p>
<p><em>Instead I played Zombie Army,</em><br>
<em>And after that the Atomfall DLC,</em><br>
<em>The reviews will come soon,</em><br>
<em>Before the full moon,</em><br>
<em>Because then a werewolf I’ll be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’m a werewolf.</em></p>
<p>Sadly nobody else was willing to take on this task, <strong>Steve</strong> even said that these efforts caused him “significant discomfort as a lecturer in English Lit and Creative Writing.” So we’re back to the boring land of basic prose, and he played “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ten-horror-game-demos-to-chill-and-thrill-you-in-steam-next-fest-this-week/">a whole bunch of Steam demos</a> and put a few hours into Mario Kart World.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Mario Kart World, <strong>Nic’s</strong> son decided to add a little bit of “4D haptics” to his gaming by whacking him in the Mushroom Kingdom’s crown jewels. Ouch! He also played Split Fiction, Survival Kids and Bravely Default’s remake on Switch 2, with reviews for them all still in the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> tired of playing games where he wasn’t the named protagonist, so went back to Blades of Fire to fight some things. He’s also reviewed Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, which is a good game marred by so many technical issues.</p>
<p>After checking out Nioh 3’s demo some more, and revisiting Dynasty Warriors: Origins for a Shu playthrough, <strong>Jim</strong> moved on to the Cairn demo. “It’s a truly unique game about climbing a mountain, from the devs who created the fantastic Furi, that somehow manages to be zen and infuriating at the same time. I’m looking forward to playing the full release though I’m hoping the performance improves drastically on PS5 (the demo was super choppy).”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> got to keep quiet about Death Stranding 2 a little longer.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>
