		<p>Valve has announced three major bits of new hardware coming in 2026, with a PC called the Steam Machine, a new wireless VR headset called Steam Frame, and a brand new controller simply named the Steam Controller. The hardware will allow you to play all of your games in your Steam library from indie titles to AAA titles. Additionally, the Steam Machine will let you install apps and different operating systems.</p>

<p>So what kind of specs are we looking at? Let’s start with the Steam Machine, which will come in two models with those being one equipped with 512GB NVMe SSD and the other a <wbr>2TB NVMe SSD. All the other hardware will be the same internally, and both will include a high-speed microSD card slot.</p>
