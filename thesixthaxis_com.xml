		<p>Cats are lying with dogs, a seven-headed beast has emerged from the ocean, the city walls have crumbled, Halo is coming to PlayStation 5. Truly, the end times are upon us. Or, well, the end of the notion that Xbox gamers will meaningfully breathe the words “console exclusive” ever again.</p>
<p>Still, it did look nice. Here’s hoping Halo: Campaign Evolved does a better job of retaining the visual feel of the original than the first Anniversary Edition.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week. Let’s get all the biggest stories we’ve caught, though.</p>

</ul>
<p>Phew! Well, what else could we squeeze into the features this week? Well, I had some thoughts about the revisionist storytelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/"><strong>Star Trek: Voyage – Across The Unknown</strong></a>, which lets you take different paths through the 90s Trek series story, and Amazon might have one of the first good uses for LLMs in video games, to create more interactive characters, starting with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/amazon-luna-wants-to-take-over-family-gamenight-with-snoop-dogg-presiding-over-courtroom-chaos/">Courtroom Chaos starring Snoop Dogg</a></strong>. Yup, he’s basically Judge Judy for the relaunching Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Rounding out the week, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/what-we-played-jurassic-world-evolutions-3-pokemon-z-a-battlefield-6/">What We Played</a></strong> featured Jurassic World Evolutions 3, Pokémon Z-A &amp; Battlefield 6.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww </strong>has finally finished the story of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, switching down to story mode to get past the button mashing of combat and the more enjoyable environmental riddles. He also made a start on Cocoon and the Silent Hill 2 remake, the latter of which had monster much too early for his tastes. He just wanted to walk round in the fog.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>
