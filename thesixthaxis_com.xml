			<p>Developer Monster Theatre has created an approachable roguelike in Atomic Owl, the studio’s debut title. You’re cast as Hidalgo Bladewing, out for revenge after losing a battle against Crow Sorcerer Omega Wing, which saw Hidalgo imprisoned and lose his friends to dark influence. The game itself is a compact Metroidvania that can be beaten in around six hours, but does it sustain its runtime?</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Owl - Official Launch Trailer | Indie3 Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XhW86Kdn9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomic Owl follows a standard roguelike formula of making as much progress as possible, dying, getting some upgrades, and then progressing further on your next run. That’s made easier, though, as Hidalgo levels up during runs by collecting green Meza. As Hidaglo levels up, his health increases, which means each run becomes that little bit more forgiving. Alongside green Meza, there’s a blue variant, which is collected from defeated enemies, and this is the currency used to unlock or improve abilities, such as getting permanent extra lives or increasing the range to absorb Mesa. </p>


<p>There are also further abilities called Wing Remnants. Some enemies drop Wing Remnants and provide bonuses for that specific run, with these including triple jump, an additional dash, or being able to deal fire damage. Wing Remnants are removed at the end of each run, and you never know what you’re going to get.</p>


<p>Atomic Owl is relatively straightforward, with combat and platforming easy to pick up. Hidalgo has access to four weapons, including a greatsword, a whip, throwable axes, and a big hammer. There’s also a scythe, which has limited throws and a cooldown. It does decent damage and can take out multiple enemies if they are in range, which is great when you are getting swarmed. Occasionally, you to need to use a specific weapon to destroy an enemy shield. The combat is not challenging, including the boss fights, with easily readable patterns. Considering the bosses are supposed to be powerful warriors, I was quite surprised how easy it was to defeat them. It may be due to wanting players to keep moving forward, but a little challenge would have been welcome.</p>
<p>The platforming is good throughout Atomic Owl, although there were a couple of moments where it felt a bit fiddly. There was one section where Hidalgo would fall off moving platforms every so often while being swarmed by enemies, and there’s a section near the end where you’re being pursued, which has moments of frustration as you need to be precise to avoid being caught. The platforming is, in my opinion, more of a challenge than the game’s combat.</p>

<p>The visual design of Atomic Owl follows classic pixel art and it has a lot of colour to it, though you can add a CRT and/or Samurai filter to give it a retro or black and white look. There’s a mix of styles across each level, from a small cityscape and woodlands, to more retro-futuristic looks in the training rooms and later levels. The blend of styles helps to keep things fresh as you make progress. The only real complaint I have is that in a couple of darker areas is can be a bit hard to see the platforms you’re supposed to leap onto. The great visual design is matched by the catchy accompanying soundtrack , though there is a level near the end where things are purposefully out of place, which won’t be for everyone. </p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Atomic Owl is a satisfying roguelike with a simple progression that allows you to make headway quickly through the levels. This does come at the expense of the combat, which is a bit too on the easy side, with the platforming much more challenging than any boss fight. Overall though, if you want a short, simple, and good looking roguelike then Atomic Owl is worth a go.	</p></div>

		<p>Microsoft has integrated an optional age verification system in the UK to comply with the newly implemented Online Safety Act, with the long-term consequence being that some social features on Xbox will be limited in the UK for those that do not verify starting in early 2026.</p>
<p>As outlined on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire news story</a>, from today, “players who indicate their account age as 18 and over, based in the UK, and signing into an Xbox experience with a Microsoft account will begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age.”</p>


<p>“Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites. Players who don’t verify their age between now and early 2026 can continue to play and enjoy Xbox. However, starting early next year, their use of social features on Xbox will become limited to friends only until they complete the age verification process. Whether a player verifies their age will not affect any previous purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games, however we encourage players to verify their age via this one-time process now to avoid uninterrupted use of social features on Xbox in the future.”</p>
<p>What’s amusing here is that game purchases will not be affected in the slightest. Little Timmy can buy at 18-rated game like Grand Theft Auto 5 without verifying his face – perhaps using gift cards – but won’t be able to chat to other people online. Except he still will be, because social features to friends will still be possible, and there must surely be some kind of facility for under-18s to make friends through chat and invites.</p>
<p>Age verification will be possible using “proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, and credit card check,” and Microsoft assures that “The information players provide during the age verification process is protected with industry-standard encryption and is not stored or used for any other purpose.”</p>

<p>Microsoft has partnered with Yoti for the facial age estimation, which was not fooled by Norman Reedus’ face as rendered by Death Stranding over the weekend.</p>
<p>The UK Online Safety Act was voted and given royal assent under the previous Tory government in 2023, with the scheduled implementation of July 2025 meaning that it is now coming into effect under the current Labour government. It might be egregious and, for the time being, exceptionally fallible for all the main things it was trying to block, but it’s also potentially a precursor to similar legislation that is being proposed in other countries and regions – the EU and US are both considering similar, we’re just so forward thinking and futuristic in the UK.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that “we’ll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process. We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences.”</p>
