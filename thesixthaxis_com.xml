		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that BlizzCon will be back in 2026, with the weekend of September 12th and September 13th selected as the date of its return. It will be taking place in Anaheim, California. BlizzCon did not take place in 2024, and nor will it take place this year either. Obviously, it is a bit too far out to speculate on what to expect but World of Warcraft will likely be a central focus.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said, <em>“One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together. We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.”</em></p>
<p>BlizzCon 2026 tickets are not on sale but you can head to the official <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-gb">BlizzCon website</a> and sign up for updates on what to expect, and get notified for tickets.</p>

		<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> on 27th March, IO Interactive has confirmed, bringing a freshly enhanced VR version of the hit assassination trilogy to Sony’s latest headset. You can see snippets from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> level, The Finish Line, played in VR in the latest trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN World of Assassination - PS VR2 - VR Games Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPfdRYXgjNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PSVR 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/hitman-3-will-become-world-of-assassination-with-free-upgrade-to-include-hitman-1-2/">Hitman World of Assassination</a> will feature all 22 locations featured through the Hitman trilogy, adding new VR-specific mechanics, designed around the headset and its independent Sense controllers. That grants you dual-wielding, full ambidexterity, and room-scale play, as well as generally improved controls and gameplay mechanics, when compared to the original PSVR release. New interactions mean that you’ll have active reloading, on-body weapon holstering, sniper scope aiming, and manual motions to take on disguises. You even see how you can throw two items at the same time to knock out guards.</p>
<p>Pricing for this release has also now been confirmed. Players who own Hitman: World of Assassination on PS5 can get a VR Access upgrade for $9.99 / €9.99 / £8.99. Alternatively, newcomers to the game can buy Hitman WOA Part One – VR2 Edition, which includes the Hitman 1 campaign and locations with PSVR 2 support for $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99. You can then upgrade to the full version with Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 levels… I’m assuming. The number of variants and options for Hitman are needlessly confusing on the PS Store, I’ll be honest. The whole rebrand to World of Assassination was meant to fix that, but then IOI created new sub-bundles and versions along the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/moon-studios-is-now-self-publishing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-after-split-with-take-two/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moon Studios has secured the publishing rights <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, their action RPG which is currently in Steam Early Access, cutting ties with Take-Two following the closure of original publishing label Private Division.</p>
<p>Characterising the change as making them “fully independent”, the studio states “We have secured the publishing rights for No Rest for the Wicked, allowing us to execute our vision without restrictions.”</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Further to this, the team revealed the next big update for the game, The Breach, which will arrive on 30th April, confirmed that co-op is coming after that, and that Ori series composer Gareth Coker is returning to contribute new music to the game.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is the first game from Moon Studios after their fruitful partnership with Microsoft for Ori and the Blind Forest and its sequel. The studio signed on with Take-Two’s indie-oriented publishing label Private Division, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-next-game-from-ori-developer-moon-studios/">announcing</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">releasing the game into Early Access</a> in early 2024.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/take-two-sells-private-division-label-to-a-secret-new-owner/">Take-Two decided to sell off Private Division</a> late last year, confirming the closure of multiple studios in the process, but with the sole exception to the sale being that they would retain publishing of No Rest for the Wicked. An odd situation, and while we’re obviously not privy to the behind-the-scenes negotiations since then, it’s clear that Moon Studios felt that they and their game would be best served by self-publishing.</p>
<p>To mark the shift to self-publishing, the studio has launched a 30% off independence sale. This is leading through to The Breach next month, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Story &amp; Areas</strong> – Players will continue their journey, exploring <em>Lowland Meadows</em> and <em>Marin Woods</em>, encountering fresh threats like the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Combat &amp; Builds</strong> – New weapon archetypes (Gauntlets &amp; Wands), new enemies, and an updated loot system for more build variety.</li>
<li><strong>Replayability Enhancements</strong> – Dynamic world changes with the ‘Alive’ System, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape the game worldt<br>
The Plague System unleashes powerful new plagued enemies and bosses. Pestilence outbreaks now occur all over Sacra, and the player can cleanse these regions to gain potent new plagued resources.</li>
<li><strong>Revamped Systems</strong> – Ability to teleport directly to their house, Improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, and major quality-of-life improvements, including improvements to timers and an entirely overhauled storage system.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> – A new option for the most dedicated players.</li>
<li><strong>Visual &amp; Performance Upgrades</strong> – Enhanced lighting, improved DLSS implementation, and optimizations for smoother gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>We looked at the game with its early access release, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">our preview</a>, “No Rest For The Wicked is a beautiful dark fantasy epic, and here at the outset of it’s journey through Early Access there’s very few reasons for you not to experience its dangerous charms.”</p>
