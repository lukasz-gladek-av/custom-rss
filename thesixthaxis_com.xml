			<p>The Switch was never known as a place for serious racing games. There’s any number of reasons for that – younger audience demographics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario’s karting stranglehold</a>, it’s lower processing power – but that didn’t stop at least one company dipping their toe in. Admittedly, the GRID series isn’t the most serious out there, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/01/grid-autosport-switch-review/">GRID Autosport</a> was a showcase for what could be achieved on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, handily shrinking down a racing game from yesteryear to run on the go. It’s fitting, then, that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grid-legends">GRID Legends</a> is arriving on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, once again becoming a beacon for Nintendo-owning racing fans who want to race wherever they are. Oh, and gamers who know that there are racing options that don’t feature moustachioed plumbers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pre-order Now — GRID™ Legends: Deluxe Edition Arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 January 29th!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1xP3-wlwyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/grid-legends-review/">GRID Legends originally released in 2022</a>, appearing across the last generation PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the shinier PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. That immediately puts it in a good spot for the Switch 2, with Nintendo’s newest system sitting somewhere between the two, performing comparably to the PS4 in many scenarios, while tapping into some of the latest techniques like DLSS and ray tracing.</p>


<p>As with GRID Autosport, Feral Interactive has taken the high octane reins from original developer Codemasters. Their approach here is certainly successful, especially because they put the game’s performance and visuals directly within your control.</p>


<p>There’s multiple graphics options, split between docked and handheld, and I immediately love that there’s defined options for both, meaning that you can have different choices set up for either situation. Docked is more straightforward. Here there’s a Graphics option, with the game set to 30fps, but with all of the effects and visual eye-candy turned up. You’re getting some lovely reflections here, enhanced weather effects and a higher resolution, sharper image, and it really does look very good indeed, albeit with the odd spot of pop-in here and there.</p>
<p>All that said, the moment you switch to the Performance mode, all of those visual niceties are forgotten. At 60fps the game just feels so much tighter, more accurate and responsive. If you’re truly a fan of racing games, you’d be hard pressed to go back to the solid, but ultimately slower-feeling Graphics option.</p>

<p>Handheld play brings even more choice and granularity. There’s four different options here, and alongside the previous Graphics and Performance, there’s Balanced as a mid-point between the two, and Battery Saver, which tunes down both graphics and performance in order to keep you playing for longer.</p>
<p>You can also toggle enhanced effects on and off too, for a further performance to power option. Crucially, every one of these visual options feels valid in some way. Saber Interactive have given players an amazing suite of options to choose from, and in aping a more PC-like suite of options, they’ve set a new benchmark for Nintendo Switch 2 ports. It could be argued that’s too many options for a fixed platform, but it doesn’t hurt to have.</p>
<p>Even at the lowest Battery Saving mode, the visuals are clean and crisp, and the game is thoroughly playable, though it looks more like the original GRID Autosport than you’re probably expecting, losing all of the visual bells and whistles that you’ll see further up the graphical options.</p>
<p>GRID Legends story mode has aged surprisingly well. The huge, ongoing popularity of racing series like Drive to Survive and Nascar Full Speed, means that GRID Legends documentary-style live action footage and in-engine racing still feels of the moment, and becoming Driver 22 puts you in the midst of it all. You are an unknown rookie, joining the upstart team Seneca Racing, aiming to take them from paddock nobodies to the talk of the track.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a little too earnest at times, and it sometimes doesn’t entirely match up with your race performances, but it’s fun, mostly well acted, and lends the game a real sense of drama. You can also become the Leonardo di Caprio pointing meme looking out for the current Doctor Who, with Ncuti Gatwa appearing as one of the race drivers.</p>

<p>Despite being four years old, there’s a lot that feels pulled from Brad Pitt’s big-budget F1 movie, especially the intense, Hans Zimmer-esque music that rises and falls through each race. I can see it being a point of contention for some – you can always turn it off – but if you want to feel like you’re in the middle of an underdog racing story, GRID Legends has it nailed.</p>
<p>One of the other reasons that the Nintendo Switch wasn’t the preferred home for serious racers was the lack of analogue triggers on either Joy-Con or Pro Controller, which are a practical necessity for modern racing games. You can adjust, though. I grew up when all racing game controls were digital, and I still find myself reverting to taps on the stick and triggers rather than small, smooth adjustments. After a moment’s adjustment, I barely noticed when playing GRID Legends. It helps that the handling and ultra-grippy cars make this rather forgiving and intended to be welcoming, and &nbsp;it all comes together really well on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Feral Interactive have built in analogue control options though. The first is to utilise the right analogue stick, giving you precise control over the cars braking and acceleration, though in a way that feels deeply unusual to me and hard to get used to. The easier option? GRID Legends supports the official Switch 2 GameCube controller, which has two, great-feeling analogue triggers. Suddenly, racing games seem a lot more appealing on the Switch 2…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While some manufacturers throw out older designs and emblazon their logo across a swathe of all-new devices and designs, iteration has become more powerful than revolution. You can look to products like the iPhone or Google’s Pixel line for design language and ideas that have shifted and developed, rather than being wholly replaced. That’s Thrustmaster’s approach with their eSwap range of controllers. These wired, modular PC and Xbox-centric controllers got so much right the first time around, that they’re fully committed to incremental improvements. That’s certainly the case with the eSwap X2 H.E. , a new, hall-effect-equipped version that retains all of the eSwap’s previous strengths while upgrading the sticks. It once again places the eSwap at the top of our favourite wired controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hall Effect H.E.A.R.T. explanation | Thrustmaster" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hfhoz4pG1s?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The eSwap X2 H.E. is a thoroughbred pro controller. The wired USB connection ensures the lowest latency, while there are four additional ‘pro’ inputs on the back that you can customise as you see fit. It’s the Hall Effect sticks though that are the headline feature, boasting much improved longevity and accuracy over the previous potentiometer sticks.</p>


<p>Calling the Eswap X2 H.E.’s build quality ‘bombproof’ is something of assurance of how well-built it is, short of actually attaching it to some sort of explosive. This is the third iteration of the eSwap that we’ve covered, and each of them continues to serve faithfully, no matter how many hours of Overwatch 2 we put into them.</p>
<p>The eSwap X2 H.E. is crafted from sturdy black plastic, weighing in at a hand-friendly 300g. Thanks to the lack of an internal battery, it easily undercuts devices like Microsoft’s Elite Pro 2 at 345g, while still maintaining enough heft and firmness to feel like a premium device.</p>


<p>There’s no textured plastics to help with grip, but two rubberised pads down either of the controller’s arms provide some extra purchase. The key to how the eSwap X2 H.E. feels is the swappable modules, which let you switch from asymmetrical to symmetrical stick layouts, buy additional modules to turn it into a competent fight pad, or even a diminutive steering wheel.</p>
<p>Each module is held in by strong magnets, but they’re easy enough to pull out whenever you need to do it. In fact, it’s pretty moreish to do so, and I find myself treating the eSwap range like some kind of fidget toy, removing and moving the modules while waiting for things to download or update. This is the third iteration I’ve reviewed, and no matter how many times you mess with them, they just keep on going. They are incredibly well built, and the eSwap X2 H.E. continues that.</p>
<p>The Hall Effect stick units are the key point of improvement here, and they feel very good indeed. I prefer the feel of Thrustmaster’s Hall Effect sticks over the previous Potentiometer versions, and they give a perfect response via HardwareTester.com. The longevity for Hall Effect sticks is far higher, and they shouldn’t ever develop the dreaded stick drift. The industry is beginning to view TMR sticks as the next iterative step for gaming controllers, but Hall Effect’s reliability and tried and tested tech will make the eSwap 2 H.E. a long-term gaming companion.</p>

<p>It’s a shame not to also find Hall Effect analogue triggers round the back, with the added reliability and precision that would have brought, but there are two ways you can tailor them to your playstyle. Firstly, there’s physical lockouts that reduce the trigger travel, making them fast and easy to activate. While playing another heap of Overwatch 2 this is tech that now feels essential, and I really don’t enjoy using controllers that don’t have this feature.</p>
<p>The other key to customising the trigger response lies in the ThrustmasterX software. Available for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, you can dig into all aspects of your controller setup, including the trigger activation point, as well as the Hall Effect sticks’ deadzone and sensitivity and your button mapping.</p>
<p>The four ‘pro’ inputs are obviously amongst the buttons you can customise, and the eSwap’s inputs definitely set it apart from the competition. There are four circular buttons, incrementally raised to sit beneath your fingers. The buttons are definitely smaller than most of the other rear pro inputs out there, but, for me, they sit really well beneath my middle and ring fingers. I could easily activate them precisely when they were needed, and I think they helped give me a much-needed edge in Overwatch 2. To be fair, I need all the help I can get.</p>

<p>The main face buttons are also here to make you as fast as possible. The four face buttons and the D-pad are all mechanical, giving an excellent click every time you press them, and reducing your response time further than ever before. That’s the resounding feel of the eSwap X2 H.E.. It feels lightning fast, rock-solid and reliable. It’s not flashy: there’s no RGB, no OLED screens, and it doesn’t even have a wireless option. It’s just an excellent, well-made controller.</p>
<p>Therein lies its strength, but you do have to wonder if we couldn’t have expected more from this version. Wireless and Bluetooth connection options would definitely make sense at this point, as would an enhanced package with case, different D-pad tops and perhaps other modules included. It feels like Thrustmaster are in a holding pattern with this release, rather than keeping pace with the competition.</p>
<p>At £139.99, the eSwap X2 H.E. is certainly a premium wired option. There’s a couple of competitors in the modular space though, with the first being Turtle Beach’s Stealth Pivot at £119.99, which has rotatable sections that perform a similar function to the eSwap’s units. However, the sticks are much shorter, and the body of the controller just isn’t as comfortable as the eSwap. That said, it gains both wireless and Bluetooth functionality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there’s also the Victrix Pro BFG, which is a good deal more expensive at £179.99, but you also get the six-button fightpad module included in the box, as well as both wireless and wired connections. Swapping your units around is a little more complicated, needing the included square screwdriver to remove them, but it’s a much more generous package overall.</p>
<p>If you’ve got any of the previous versions of the eSwap controller, though, you can simply buy the new eSwap Hall Effect modules for a very reasonable £24.99, with two different heights available to tailor your setup even further. This has to be one of the most consumer-friendly approaches in the peripheral market, and one which puts Thrustmaster at a clear advantage. More of this sort of thing, please.</p>
