		<p>Oh man, not only is the sun shining, but Nintendo are shining down on us too with the glorious reveal of all the Switch 2 details you could want (apart from pesky things like what chipset it’s rocking or the amount of RAM, but who needs to know that when there’s Mario Kart!). The battle is now on for pre-orders, and ShopTo have already told me I’m not in there first allocation. This has caused panic, but I’m sure that when the Nintendo store invites roll out I’ll be there. Surely, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>So this week, I asked the team what they were playing, and whether they were going to jump right into the Switch 2, hold off, or just play on the consoles they already have!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played Croc for review, saying, “I found it pretty average. I’m currently playing Blue Prince for review and I’ll have more on that next week. Regarding the Switch 2, I won’t be getting one. I have a Switch that was barely used and I just don’t have the time I used to have to be able to keep up with games on multiple consoles anymore. I’m still playing Witcher 3 and I started that back in November!”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has returned from Japan, and has dipped his toe into Monster Hunter Wilds in anticipation of Mizutsune (coming soon) and MTG Arena in anticipation of Tarkir (also coming soon). He says, “It’s gonna be a good month for games I like, but boy do I miss Japan already! As for the Switch 2, I’ll get one as soon as I can, but I doubt I’ll be in the preorder list as I haven’t had Switch Online for two years straight (I let it lapse when I have nothing to play online)!”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Balatro, Phasmo, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Hitman regrettably not in VR. When asked about the Switch 2, he simply said, “Price increases on games sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still very much in his ‘play one game at a time’ mode so he’s been putting a few more hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He told us, “I wasn’t really vibing with the gameplay and open-ended story progression but something seems to have clicked – getting to this point has taken longer than what I would have liked but there’s a lot of fun to be had stalking the cities and castles of feudal Japan as Naoe, then bull-rushing everything as Yasuke.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Atomfall, saying, “It’s just a brilliant setting and great characters make it a joy to explore. Combat is perfunctory but the amount of dialogue options and accompanying meaningful choices that have genuine impact on the world more than make up for that. I’ve also just started on Commandos Origins for review. I’m not gonna pre-order a Switch 2, mostly because I’m poor. Though I’m sure I’ll eventually pick one up when Nintendo’s brilliant first-party stuff starts coming through.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing the required Destiny 2, but also Black Myth Wukong which he says, “Is how games should be, nice short intro with stabby bits and not too long to get in to the game, and Indika in which I go against type and play as a nun. It’s very atmospheric.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been enjoying Atomfall, whilst persevering with the ridiculous amount of collectables in Lego Skywalker and getting stuck into Metroid Dread. He says, “I’ve got a load of Switch games I’ve yet to play so no plans to pick up a Switch 2 any time soon – especially as many of the things it has to offer can already be done by my Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> meanwhile, has been out in Paris playing on the Switch 2 in real life! He has lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">thoughts</a> and words about it, all of which you can find on TSA over the next few days.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played? And were you impressed enough by the Switch 2 Direct?</p>

		<p>Nintendo love a gimmick. Sometimes it ends up with three prongs on your controller, other times it’s waggle controls that even your nan can have fun with, and sometimes it’s something that you think is going to be a quirky niche idea, but that has the potential to be so much more. That’s the Joy-Con 2’s mouse input mode.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, this is destined to be one of the many console-specific features that most third parties are going to overlook or pay the most minimal lip service to, but when it is used effectively, it can be, dare I say, game-changing?</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s optical sensors in the connection rails of both left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers, making them both equally usable as impromptu computer mice. It’s as simple as tipping or holding the Joy-Con on its side with the sensor to a surface and, combined with the gyroscope and motion sensor, the Switch knows immediately that you’ve got it in mouse mode. You don’t need to have the strap attachment on the Joy-Con to do this, but with the two glides at top and bottom of the rail, they do help give you a smooth motion when using it as a mouse.</p>
<p>Thanks to modern optical sensors, which take tiny pixellated images thousands of times a second for motion tracking, the Joy-Con 2 can be used on many surfaces. Sure, a tabletop with a large mouse mat gives the best experience, but this is adaptable and, just like using a computer mouse in an awkward spot, you can use the Joy-Con 2 on your trouser leg or arm of your sofa.</p>


<p>From the initial batch of games, Drag x Drive is the one that is really built around the mouse controller. It’s not about using it as a pointer here, but rather as a physical motion to simulate pushing left and right wheels on your character’s wheelchair. Just push the mouse along the surface to get yourself up to speed, use only one in order to turn, the triggers to brake, and then motion controls to lift up the basketball and shoot from range –&nbsp;you can, naturally, go in for a sick ramp jump and dunk the ball.</p>
<p>It’s a tiring game from the repetitious, uncommon arm movement, and it takes a while to adjust to manoeuvring yourself like this –&nbsp;speaking as someone who does not use a wheelchair. In that way, I’m reminded somewhat of ARMS, the boxing game from around the launch of the Nintendo Switch. Physical motion and controls, a small-scale sports game, and a testbed to prove the potential.</p>

<p>More likely, mouse mode will be used for smaller spin-off modes and minigames. That’s exactly what you find in Super Mario Party Jamboree’s Switch 2 Edition expansion. We got to try out six of these, with a mixture of shaking and spray painting, air hockey, pulling back to launch windup cars, and one of those precision mazes where you can’t touch the sides. They’re great little games and rather intuitive, but some will be more suited to trouser play than others.</p>
<p>But for me, the most impactful use was actually with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. If you’re holding individual Joy-Con 2, then at any time you can switch from standard gamepad controls to mouse mode just by tipping the controller on its side. It sounds dumb, but it was an ample reminder of just how much more precise mouse controls are for aiming than gamepads are.</p>
<p>The section that we played was action heavy with plenty of battles against Space Pirates that build up to a boss battle against a Metroid-infested monstrosity. The precision of the mouse mode let me track and aim at enemies just so much better and more intuitively.</p>

<p>However, there’s a few added quirks here. For one thing, there’s still a target lock-on, a bit of a holdover from earlier Metroid Prime titles, and there’s also a free-aim toggle that can be used with motion or mouse mode control. Motion felt floaty and vague here, when trying to hit multiple targets on a door, but mouse mode was absolutely precise.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I thought that I’d switch back to gamepad controls, but found that I basically couldn’t aim anymore. I quickly just tipped my hand over and went back to mouse mode.</p>
<p>And that’s the power of this option. It will only really be applicable as an instant control mode shift when playing with Joy-Con in hand, but if that’s how you play (as opposed to with a Pro Controller or in handheld mode), then this has the potential to be a great option. But that caveat of needing to play with separate Joy-Con is probably what will doom this to being a niche and oft-overlooked feature.</p>
