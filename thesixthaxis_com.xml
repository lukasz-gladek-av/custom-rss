			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/echoes-of-the-end">Echoes of the End</a> was a pleasant surprise, when it originally released last year. It’s an action adventure game that draws inspiration from the God of War reboot pretty heavily, but dispenses with the open world for a linear experience and a more focused story. The result was a good game with particularly well written characters that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/01/echoes-of-the-end-review/">held back by some polish and control issues</a>. So to improve all that, Myrkur games released a free Enhanced Edition update.</p>
<p>Not only has combat been reworked to improve the overall flow, which was perhaps my biggest issue, but it’s even changed the opening of the game to get you to the main story that bit quicker. Then there’s a new gear and armour system, allowing you to customise Ryn’s outfit and abilities and adding further depth to the game as well. They’ve since added a photo mode and some additional outfits on top of that.</p>
<p>It’s also been added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue, so it’s easier than ever to try out for subscribers. I revisited to see some of the improvements for myself and reevaluate my initial review, now the game has been thoroughly updated.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Updates &amp; PlayStation Plus - Echoes of the End" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q58Ype92SHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First off, the combat is clearly improved, but still not perfect. The issue I had with not flowing between inputs – for example, dodging, and then a follow-up input to aim an ability not being registered, leaving you vulnerable – has been reduced, but not eliminated entirely. It doesn’t happen as often, but it does still happen. The combat overall is improved though, whereas previously it could feel a little too loose to the point that I lowered the difficulty because it got frustrating. It now feels tight enough that I don’t feel that the challenge is unfair anymore, and that’s a significant enough improvement on its own.</p>


<p>But then there’s the outfits and relics system, which is quite a large change to patch into a game. The outfits are crafted once you find a schematic in the world, using a resource called Glimmerweave that you’ll loot during gameplay. However, an outfit can come with a relic that can be added into one of two slots for a gameplay bonus, such as gaining additional health whilst draining enemies or extra damage reduction. These relics can also be found in the world and some of them are meant to game-changing effects, though I’m too early in my new playthrough to have found one of those yet. What’s already obvious is that they add a more depth to character customisation, allowing you to tailor Ryn to your playstyle, not to mention some more rewards for exploring the game world. In New Game+, you even have an extra relic slot to use as well.</p>

<p>Then there’s the newly added photo mode as well, which obviously lets you take photos of the game. Frankly it’s surprising it wasn’t already in the game, as Echoes of the End is a really stunning game. The Icelandic-inspired environments in particular are gorgeous and the huge backgrounds give the game an impressive sense of scale, so there’s plenty of places to be taking pictures.</p>
<p>Outside of all this, it’s still Echoes of the End. The combat was already a lot of fun when it worked properly – I mean, what’s not to like about throwing enemies at other enemies, or slamming them into the ground? Now it’s been improved, it’s even better, even if it still isn’t perfect. However, the characters are the star of the show here. Ryn and Cor are convincing from the off and Abram, once he arrives an hour or so into the game, is immediately engaging. This is all thanks to well written, witty dialogue and excellent performances particularly from Ryn and Abram’s voice actors. The conversations can be surprisingly introspective and vulnerable, and it doesn’t hurt that there’s plenty of mystery in the background to keep you guessing about what’s happening.</p>

<p>Echoes is a pretty short game by the standards of other games that play similarly these days, taking me just under eleven hours on my first playthrough, though there’s no doubt it would have been longer if there were relics and outfits for me to find as well. Frankly, restarting the game made me realise I actually miss some of the characters a little bit. I don’t think there’s much higher praise for writing than that, which is why I’ll be giving New Game+ a go.</p>

		<p>One of the original team who pushed for the creation of the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley,&nbsp; has suggested that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, has been appointed to see the gradual wind down of the brand – because it’s nothing to do with AI.</p>
<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” Blackley told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night.”</p>


<p>“It just seems really true. I imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn’t like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who’d never seen a live show. Why would you do that?” he adds.</p>
<p>“The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI,” he continues. “That’s what you’re seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that’s what we’re seeing.”</p>
<p>He also had some views on how the gaming community would react to Sharma’s appointment, first stating the gamers are very tolerant of non-gamers telling them what to believe, but then make it’s clear he is joking, “No, they’re not tolerant of any of these things. That’s the wall she’s about to discover.”</p>

<p>Seamus Blackley is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-blackley-25733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently</a> CEO of Pacific Light &amp; Hologram, a “technology start-up working in stealth mode to realise fully immersive 3D experience.” He also taught the world how to make Sourdough bread using ancient yeast and historical baking methods during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>You can read the full interview over on <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>, it’s well worth a read. You can also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">read our thoughts about outgoing CEO. Phil Spencer’s legacy here.</a></p>
<p>Do you think Xbox will continue as a brand or get sidelined by Microsoft as the chase AI? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced the requirements for the PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, some free DLC, and the performance options for the game.</p>
<p>“Death Stranding 2 for PC offers a range of Graphics Presets from Low to Very High, catering to both budget gaming PC’s and high-end systems,” say Nixxes, who are handling the port. “We’ve also added a Portable preset, aimed at handheld gaming devices, for those Porters who want to “keep on keeping on” while on the go.”</p>



<p>The performance-enhancing options are a special Chinese herb that has been used for millennia, which guarantees at least three extra inches to satisfy…. wait, wrong press release.</p>
<p><em>“The PC edition of Death Stranding 2 launches with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 4 and Intel XESS 2. Both upscaling and frame generation options are available for all technologies.”</em></p>

<p><em>“For the first time on PC, you’ll find Pico as an option in Upscale Settings. This “Progressive Image Compositor” is developed by Guerrilla for the Decima engine and is the same upscaling technology that’s used for Death Stranding 2 on PS5. Pico upscaling can be used with all supported graphics cards and can be combined with the various options for frame generation offered in the game.”</em></p>
<p><em>“All upscaling options can be used in combination with Dynamic Resolution Scaling, or with an upscaling quality setting of choice to improve performance. Native AA options are also available for maximum fidelity.”</em></p>
<p>You will also be able to play on ultra-wide screens if you have one, with all of the cut scenes in 21:9 aspect ratio and gameplay in 32:9 ratio.&nbsp; If you do not have an ultra-wide screen monitor you can still play in those resolutions but with some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>This mode will also be coming to the PS5 version of the game, and PS5 players will also get the Porter Suit: Link and Patch: Link for free when the game launches on PC.</p>

<p>I reviewed the PS5 version of Death Stranding 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/"> scoring it 8/10.</a> “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end,” said I. “The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>
