		<p>Liquid Swords, the development studio founded by founder of Just Cause dev Avalanche Studios Christofer Sundberg, has announced its first game. That game is Samson: A Tyndalston Story, a new open world game where the stakes are always high. You play as the as Samson who lives in the city of Tyndalston where he has built up a mountain of debt and the lenders want their money back.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt. Samson has a points system and you have to spend those points to select which missions to undertake. Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progess in the game, you will be able to improve Samson’s skills from fighting to driving as he tries to survive in this world, before the debt gets too much and he runs out of time. Samson will have to keep improving as things progress, as the world changes around him and things get more dangerous. At the moment, Samson: A Tyndalston Story has been confirmed for PC only with a release date yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> relaunch is set to arrive on 17th December with a big gameplay realignment and rebranding as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, 1047 Games has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded | December 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is a major gameplay direction shift from that of Splitgate 2 at its launch in June. The Factions have been removed and so have the Abilities that were bound to them, making for a more purist focus on classic arena shooter combat. Because of this, the game progression has been rebuilt and the Ranked system overhauled.</p>
<p>There’s five new maps alongside six that have been fully-reworked, and you’ll play on them with new Arena modes, including a Classic Arena mode that has even starts and powerups to grab. Oh, and there’s three new Primary Weapons and a Railgun as a new Power Weapon.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, store prices have been reduced, the battle pass has been simplified, and they’re promising improved cosmetics quality.</p>

<p>Instead of studio founder Ian Proulx, who appeared in a bungled stage appearance at Summer Game Fest for the Splitgate 2 launch, 1047 Games Design Director Josh Watson provided the main quote, “Splitgate has always been a love letter to the arena shooters we grew up playing. We’ve been hard at work rebuilding the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2, removing what didn’t work, and refining what did.”</p>
<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will launch on 17th December for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4 and Xbox One, and 1047 will be really, really hoping it’s better received this time around, and that they can generate enough good will to recapture the breakout popularity of the original game’s first open beta tests.</p>

		<p>The Game Bakers have announced a new release date for their mountain climbing game Cairn, which was delayed back in September as the team needed more time. The new release date for Cairn is January 29th, when it will be released for PC and PS5. Ahead of the full release, you can play the Cairn demo on Steam and PS5 to get an idea of what to expect on your climb of Kami.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Game Bakers has also revealed the details of the Deluxe Edition, along with pricing for the different versions of the game. The Cairn Deluxe Edition will include a Kami travel book, wallpapers, and three keepsakes that can be added to main character Aava’s rucksack. Both versions will have a 10% launch discount with the standard edition priced at $26.99/26.99€ / £22.99 / JP¥3060 / CN¥98 and the Deluxe Edition priced at $34.20/ 34.20€ / £28.60 / JP¥3924 / CN¥129.</p>
<p>In Cairn, players climb the mountain Kami as explorer Aava. On this journey, Aava will find traces of past climbs, historical artefacts that tell the story of the mountain, and run into other climbers who are on their own journeys. Cairn is a realistic climbing simulator where you will need to guide Aava to suitable holds for her hands and feet, while also maintaining balance so she does not fall off of Mount Kami.</p>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun developer Auroch Digital has announced its next FPS, and you will be shooting at aliens but not in the Warhammer universe. This time, Auroch Digital has turned its attention to Starship Troopers announcing Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War, which is a single player retro styled FPS where players will shoot a lot of bugs to do their part.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFb2E7IzXKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! will see the return of General Jonny Rico, with Casper Van Dien reprising his role, along with new character Major Samantha “Sammy” Dietz. In the game’s campaign players will have access to over 30 weapons to use against the bugs as the war across the galaxy rages on.</p>
<p>While a release date has not be confirmed yet, Auroch Digital is aiming for an early 2026 window. Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! is due to be released for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>Well, I don’t think anyone was expecting a new Carmageddon game to be announced, and yet 34BigThings has revealed Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. The new Carmageddon game is a roguelite racer where vehicular combat is central to every event. Players will have a number of different vehicle bodies and weapon types to use to build their own deadly racer. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is also taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>A big cinematic story trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, revealing some of the alien races that you’ll battle and a surprise Space Marine team-up in the fight for the future of the planet Kronus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - Story Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja6IOle_Thg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The planet Kronus was the setting for the second DLC campaign for the original Dawn of War game, and this leads us back to battling some familiar foes. Co-written by Black Library author John French, the story sees Kronus beset by an Ork infestation, now with two rival Ork Warbosses vying for power, while the Necrons are emerging from their tombs beneath the surface, as well as with an invasion fleet appearing above.</p>
<p>That’s a lot for a Space Marine Chapter to deal with, as formidable as they all are, so it’s a good thing that they’ll be getting a hand. The Adeptus Mechanicus will feature in the game, and the Dark Angels are also turning to to ally themselves with the Blood Ravens. You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. They’ve also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>

<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>
