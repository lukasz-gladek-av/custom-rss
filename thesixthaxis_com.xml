		<p>Hot on the heels of the most recent Steam Next Fest, and just in time for Halloween, here’s a selection of some of the most promising horror titles coming your way over the next few months. This year has already been a strong one for horror with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, whilst I previewed the great <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/becrowned-is-as-close-to-an-old-school-silent-hill-as-you-can-get/">Becrowned</a> a few weeks ago, but the future is looking even more scarily good with these eight games.</p>
<h3>Among Ashes (PS5, PC – December 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Horror Game Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game on this list actually comprises three different gaming experiences in one spooky package. You begin by playing a generic Doom clone on an early 2000s looking PC before your gaming is interrupted by a chat message from a friend telling you about a cursed exe that he has heard about. Once you’ve downloaded this in-game, you then embark on a wonderfully retro first person Resident Evil style adventure. The demo gives a decent amount of gameplay in this second style before closing out by teasing an intrusion into the real space of the player in the game.&nbsp;I’m excited to see how these different levels will interact in the full version.</p>

<h3>Below, Rusted Gods (PC, Q1 2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2895680/Below_Rusted_Gods/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Below Rusted Gods - DEMO AVAILABLE for FREE on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9gGtygCFsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A deeply atmospheric management game where you are the sole radio contact for a group exploring a mysterious passage that has opened up in a research lab. You have to monitor various machines that monitor the team’s progress and give appropriate advice whilst also dealing with strange happenings in the base. The demo feels quite self contained as a short experience so I’m intrigued how a longer version will work.</p>
<h3>Butcher’s Creek (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BUTCHER'S CREEK - Pre-Release Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHYGSdC1x0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This grubby grimehouse first person melee focused game absolutely nails the exploitation vibe and takes clear inspiration from both Condemned: Criminal Origins and Manhunt. You get captured by a snuff film making gang and must bludgeon your way out. Healing requires you to take photos of blood and gore so you have to actually check out your surroundings which is neat. This is looking perfect for fans of Puppet Combo games and their ilk.</p>
<h3>Don’t Fret (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716830/Dont_Fret/"><em>Demo available on Steam</em></a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DON'T! FRET - DEMO ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER | Upcoming Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkCD_dxdNc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m not normally one for mascot horror, having bounced off the original Five Nights franchise, but Don’t Fret is far more of a game than is usual for the subgenre. You play as an anthropomorphic guitar lost in a dark and mysterious musical college that serves as a metaphor for childhood traumas. You must explore, solve puzzles, and avoid the dangerous teaching staff that embody your deepest fears. The soundtrack is produced by a number of prominent YouTube musicians and this plays like a real labour of love.</p>
<h3>Echoes of the Living (PC, 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2173460/Echoes_of_the_Living/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living - Updated Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDq9X0_ldI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bucking the trend for recent Silent Hill inspired titles, Echoes of the Living is a clear homage to vintage Resident Evil. I’ve played several demos of this game over the past few years and it is just getting increasingly more polished and exciting every time. The most recent demo acts as a prologue and introduces you to one of the playable characters, Liam. The game plays out much like an HD upscale of Resident Evil 2 or Nemesis and absolutely nails the look and feel of the genre. Without any hyperbole this is my most anticipated indie horror game.</p>
<h3>Heartworm (2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Heartworm Trailer | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvuFt-JyvQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Probably the most well known title on this list, Heartworm has had a somewhat troubled time in development with publisher difficulties but has now found a home with Dread XP. Completing a trilogy of Silent Hill inspired games alongside Hollowbody and Becrowned, Heartworm embraces tank controls whilst offering both fixed camera and over the shoulder perspectives. You play as Sam, who has lost those she loves and finds herself trapped in a nightmare of ghosts and alternate dimensions. The demo also included a boss fight with a giant spider that shows off how the camera based combat will play out. This looks set to be a new classic of the genre.</p>
<h3>Ritual Tides (PC, Consoles – Q3 2025)</h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ritual Tides - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBt0urULPAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the most mysterious and enigmatic title on this list, as it was only officially announced this week, but has already made quite a stir in horror circles. This will be the first game from Vertpoint Studios, but the team is made up of industry veterans who clearly have ambitious plans. Little is known yet outside of some concept art and the vague description of the player washing up on an isolated island off the coast of Cornwall but the premise and sounds fantastic and the pedigree of those involved is unquestioned. Look out for more details as we get them.</p>
<h3>Sparrow (PC, coming soon)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983920/SPARROW/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPARROW - Gameplay Footage #1 | Sci-Fi Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpNodZgCzaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a complete departure from the nostalgic homages to genre classics, Sparrow is an original and awesome concept for a horror game. You play as a little sparrow looking for your chicks, but are in constant danger from lots and lots of spiders. The main flying mechanics proved to be a little tricky at first in the demo, but that just adds to the challenge. Once you get the hang of them you’ll be pulling off some sweet moves swooping and diving away from predators. The demo ends on a real cliffhanger, by introducing an entirely new type of enemy. The whole thing reminds me of a species switch of the fantastic but forgotten Wii exclusive Dangerous Creatures.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, there you have it, eight incredible horror games to look out for between now and next Halloween. The sheer range and depth of the indie horror scene is fantastic to see and there are many other titles that just missed out on this list. So, whether you want nostalgic survival horror, creepy mascot frights, or entirely new takes on terror, you’ll find something to suit you. And remember, kids, horror games aren’t just for October and can be played and enjoyed all year round!</p>
