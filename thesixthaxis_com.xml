		<p>Developer 34BigThings has posted a new blog giving details on five of the 17 vehicles that will be available in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. Each of these five cars has different attributes changing how you can handle the track and the weapon load outs. With such varied styles for each one, there will be clear favourites depending on your own playstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Eagle GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxKie2O5ZoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first of the cars is the Eagle GT which is considered a good allrounder muscle car, with its best attribute being its handling. It also has armour and is heavier than most of the other vehicles in the game, making it useful for close melee encounters with others. The Eagle GT’s starting weapon is the machine gun which can be lethal against metal and flesh, but its effectiveness drops the further away you are from your target. The starting perk is Boost Refill which lets you start a race with a boost bottle, and refunds it if you get reset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Clunker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4d9jXu92N84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first unlockable vehicle in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is the Clunker. The Clunker is one of the tankier options available where its durability and defense is very high, but this comes at the cost of speed so it will not win outright. Instead, players using The Clunker should be more focused on getting close to other players and taking them down by either bashing into them or using the shotgun. The Tank Return perk increases damage output the more you improve the Clunker’s defense.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Firecracker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJYzOm3olY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Firecracker Turbo is the care for players who value speed over all else. Acceleration is this vehicle’s top stat followed by speed, meaning players can dominate in a straight line but there is the risk of spinning out if control is not maintained. The Firecracker Turbo comes equipped with missiles to take out anyone who passes, while the Magic Number perk gives boost and ammo bonuses but only on every 7th use.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - SQR-NE55" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmvm6PA_Obs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The SQR-NE55 is the most balanced vehicle of the bunch, an allrounder with no standout stats, with this being a car to choose once you are confident with game. While it has no standout stats, the SQR-NE55 does have a laser gun that can do heavy damage at all ranges. The vehicle comes with the Whale perk which gives upgrade discounts and free restocks so you can shape the SQR-NE55 into your own style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Hawk GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsbBYSbkvTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hawk GT is a vehicle that as top speed, offense, and acceleration but at the sacrifice of handling, meaning all of that power under the hood is useless if you can’t keep it on the track. The Hawk GT is armed with a high-caliber shotgun which is slow to use but deals high damage to targets, and the vehicle also comes equipped with the Meat Shield perk which increases durability with every undead that is defeated.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>
