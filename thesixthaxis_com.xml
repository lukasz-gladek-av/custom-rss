		<p>We love a good MOBA here at TSA Towers. Heck, we probably like the odd bad one too. One of the latest and greatest entries in the mega-popular genre is SMITE 2, the sequel to Titan Forge Games breakout hit. While it’s currently rumbling through an open beta launch, the team are adding new content virtually daily, getting it ready for its full launch, with the latest addition being a returning new god in the form of Cabrakan, and the Wandering Market, a bazaar where players can spend their hard-earned – or potentially hard-bought – Coins on new skins for their favourite characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 Free-to-Play Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTbb9B3UinQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Everything was announced at this past weekend’s SMITE 2 Founders Series event in Las Vegas. The Wandering Market will provide a rotating store for all players to access for free, with additional cosmetic items available via the paid, Premium Collection.</p>
<p>Players will be able to earn Coins to spend in the Wandering Market by completing quests and gaining XP each day. All those lovely Coins will be spendable across the various different collections released in the Wandering Market, so players will be able to save them up for future storefronts/sales as they play, and spend them whenever the mood takes them.</p>
<p>In turn, they shadow-dropped player-favourite Cabrakan into the sequel, delighting many long-term fans. Cabrakan, the destroyer of mountains, represents the Mayan Pantheon of Gods and uses earthquakes to disrupt and crowd control the opposition. We can’t wait to go hands on with him now he’s arrived.</p>

<p>While all this lovely information dropped, they also played a spot of competitive SMITE 2, with the first Founders Series Champions being crowned in Las Vegas when ‘Team Name but with 5 Ms’ beat Team Risk 3-2 in the finals, with BennyQ being crowned MVP. </p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online in the US after being caught up in the TikTok ban that came into effect for a day at the end of the Biden administration, and developer Second Dinner has now said that they are looking for a new partner and publisher to ensure that the game is unaffected by any future trade wars and legislation.</p>
<p>Chief Development Officer and Second Dinner Co-Founder Ben Brode said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3lg7txo2bcc2j">BlueSky</a>:</p>


<p>WHEW. MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than answers. We appreciate your patience, but in the meantime enjoy playing MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to update with more information as soon as possible!</p>

<p>The TikTok ban, a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._7521"><span>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a>, wasn’t just about banning TikTok, but any app created, owned, published or controlled by Chinese tech company ByteDance, or other companies branded as foreign adversary controlled. While Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner is an independent studio based in California, the game is published by ByteDance subsidiary Nuverse.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/20/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/">takedown of Marvel Snap</a> came as a complete surprise to pretty much everyone – the developers included – and has seen the game removed from digital storefronts looking to comply with the law. Within hours, it became clear that service would be restored, off the back of comments from incoming President Trump saying that he would grant the companies a 90 day reprieve to sell TikTok or find some other workaround – he’d actually said this prior to the service being cut and the ban coming into effect, mind you.</p>

		<p>Just as we’re winding down in the UK a flurry of news drops through the virtual letterbox to keep us on our toes, and the first of these is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II’s roadmap. Developer Warhorse and publisher PLAION are obviously keen to let gamers know just what they can expect in the months following the game’s release on the 4th of February, when it arrives for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Roadmap Trailer (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC7NdeLnMjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most crucial thing, is that a batch of this content will come via free updates, meaning they’re not nickel and diming you for every little addition – a welcome relief in the current gaming sphere.</p>
<p>Seasonal highlights will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring: Enjoy a selection of updates, free for everyone, introducing a Barbers feature to customise your look, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a greater challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</li>
<li>Summer: Brushes with Death – Embark on a thrilling quest as Henry aids an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. Journey across the lands of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, facing perilous encounters and unravelling a web of dangerous schemes.</li>
<li>Autumn: Legacy of the Forge – Dive into Henry’s roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Work to restore a once-renowned forge and prove your skills in the art of blacksmithing as you uncover forgotten tales of the past.</li>
<li>Winter: Mysteria Ecclesia – Enter the Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue runs deep. Tasked with a covert mission, Henry must navigate the complex dynamics of the region, discovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these expansions will be a number of free quality-of-life updates to ensure that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reaches its full potential.</p>


<p>We’ve been lucky enough to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">make a start with the game</a>, and Gamoc is already deeply impressed with it, though it’s definitely not been an easy start for him. He says, “Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 seems like an uncompromising marvel. It’s slavishly devoted to realism and accuracy in a way that likely makes it a very niche game, as working out how to do things can be difficult and requires real attention and care. Then again, that was exactly what drew millions to the first game, and as those fans will attest, it’s also incredibly rewarding.” He continues, “The first time I finished a quest that involved combat without it feeling like too much trouble I physically punched the air in celebration, and when I finally reached the blacksmith, got a job, and forged myself a new sword I was grinning from ear to ear. This is a unique game that turns being a peasant in medieval times into an enjoyable experience. Ironically, perhaps.”</p>
