		<p>That’s that then. 2024 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2025, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today. we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of over-the-top shenanigans too!</p>
<h2>50 – Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>


<p>Kicking off the list is Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn. Coming off the back of a successful and well received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, there will be much anticipation for Bloober’s next foray into the survival horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has time travel at its core, with your character being a Traveler. This Traveler goes back to the past, where the world falls to an event called The Change which has killed much of humanity and turned the remnants into monsters. As a Traveler, you scour the future for rifts to travel to 1980’s Poland looking key people and bringing their Essence to the future. However, the job won’t be easy and every encounter with an enemy will be extremely dangerous. Get ready for some scary timey-wimey stuff.</p>

<h2>49- The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, you just want a violent, revenge story to dive right into, and it looks like The First Berserker: Khazan will be that game. Ben Starr, the iconic voice behind Final Fantasy XVI’s Clive Rosfield, has been cast as General Khazan. General Khazan is betrayed by his Emperor and exiled to the the mountains, where he nearly dies. However, after surviving he merges with the Blade Phantom, and sets out for revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan - Early 2025 Launch Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvdSisTLPhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world of The First Berserker: Khazan will be merciless. Set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, every foe will provide a challenge in combat. Bosses will be even tougher, and defeat will come easily to those who are not prepared for it.</p>
<h2>48 – Bionic Bay</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 13th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Bionic Bay is a platformer that looks like it will be combining a lot of elements to bring a challenging experience for players. The game will feature abilities to slow down time momentarily, flip gravity, and teleport to avoid dangers. You will also use these abilities to open up and create paths to move forward.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bionic Bay - Gameplay First Look Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpaMbI7Awqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the trailer, it looks like Bionic Bay will really test player skills and reactions, as well as expect puzzle solving to figure out how to pass obstacles. The most exciting looking part though has to be the online racing, where you compete against others to run through courses in the quickest time. It looks like absolutely exhilarating carnage. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/">Bionic Bay demo</a> on Steam.</p>
<h2>47 – Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – May 2025</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> was a fun time, pitting players on a hostile world and leaning right into the comedy. Revenge of the Savage Planet looks like it will continue right in that vein, but with one major change to the gameplay. Where Journey was a first person title, Revenge of the Savage Planet will be in third person.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Revenge of the Savage Planet Gameplay Preview | PC Gaming Show" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WQ8EEDycDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet looks colourful and chaotic, but with plenty of danger to watch out for. You will need to shoot, scavenge, and upgrade to survive after being abandoned by Alta Interglobal. Interestingly, there is not just one savage planet to learn to survive on. There are four this time around, all enjoyable on your own or in co-op.</p>
<h2>46 – Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 21st February 2025</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza/Like A Dragon series is as much known for its leftfield side quests and spin offs, as it is for its more serious crime stories. Yet, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii may just be the most out there for the series, and placing Goro Majima as a pirate captain with his own ship. It is bonkers and fits the character of Majima so well, who is probably only second to Kiryu when it comes to the franchise’s cast.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCmDF0NqZQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin off set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/25/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-let-you-build-your-dream-home-holiday-island/">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. In this spin off, Majima has lost all of his memories and wakes up on a desert island. Soon, after he is the captain of his own pirate ship, engaging in naval battles with other pirate captains, and setting foot on a pirate enclave known as Madlantis. Combat will be more of the classic action style of Yakuza, rather than the turn based of Like A Dragon, and we are expecting the story to be both bonkers and full of feeling when it drops anchor.</p>
