<p>Fold &amp; Fly will have procedurally generated levels, which means you are unlikely to have the same layouts to fly through during each play session. Additionally, the game will map generator using seed inputs, allowing players to create and save new maps to play through as well.

<p>✦ Intuitive, smooth flying gameplay with paper plane physics<br>
✦ Infinite procedurally generated worlds to explore<br>
✦ Score-chasing action: collect stars and chain near-misses<br>
✦ Glowing origami dragonflies that summon portals to new worlds<br>
✦ A whimsical, handcrafted art style<br>
✦ Easy to pick up, satisfying to master<br>
✦ Great for quick sessions or long flow-state flights</p>
