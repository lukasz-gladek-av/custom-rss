		<p>Aspyr Media have announced that the remaster of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deus-ex-remastered/"> Deus Ex </a>will no longer launch on February 5th 2026 and as usual, the delay is because they think the game needs more work.</p>
<p>The full statement reads:</p>

<p>The game was only revealed in September this year via a collaboration of Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal. They seemed to be taking the right approach to the game stating The mission: preserve the truth, modernize the tools, and prepare a new generation of agents for what lies ahead.”</p>

<p>“This remaster isn’t just a visual upgrade, but a preservation of Deus Ex’s DNA – carefully modernized without sacrificing the conspiratorial paranoia that made the original game so iconic,” he adds. “Each location has been overhauled with new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,” they added.</p>
<p>The title was scheduled for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The reception to the trailer was not exactly warm as the remaster adds new textures, upgrades the models and adds new lighting, but the levels are still very empty and sparse.&nbsp; However, the models are not exactly modern and it looks more like someone has put an Instagram filter over the original game.</p>
