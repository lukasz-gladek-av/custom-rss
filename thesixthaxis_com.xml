            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now available alongside today’s full launch of the game. It’s a big one for PC gamers, with the addition of path tracing (AKA full ray tracing) for NVidia GPUs, but there’s also bug fixes across the game.</p>
<p>Path tracing completely replaces the game’s lighting and reflections using the ray tracing tech built into Nvidia GPUs, where the fallback mode is a hybrid that includes ray traced global illumination and more traditional techniques for light, reflections, shadows and the like. It will be equivalent to the path tracing option that was patched in for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>… and it’s similarly expensive on the GPU, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/indiana-jones-and-the-giant-circle-minimum-specs-recommended-ultra-pc-requirements-4k-ray-tracing/">MachineGames recommending GeForce RTX 40 Series cards</a> and requiring the use of upscaling.</p>


<p>Speaking of which, the only upscaling techniques are currently Nvidia’s DLSS and a generic TAAU, but AMD FSR will be added in a future update. Oh, and a pesky dynamic resolution bug that affected us when playing with an AMD GPU has also been fixed by this update.</p>
<p>Out now across PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and via certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Darktide on PS5 – Another standout Warhammer 40K shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/darktide-on-ps5-%E2%80%93-another-standout-warhammer-40k-shooter.1055514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The wait for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> on PS5 was made a little more bearable for 40K fans earlier this year with the release of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. Saber Interactive’s surprise sequel to the 2011 hack n’ slash/shooter hybrid has achieved phenomenal success, and is certainly a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>However, Darktide is a markedly different kind of game, hailing from the same school of shooter as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> and indeed developer Fatshark’s flagship title, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>. No doubt seeing how popular their co-op action series has grown, the Swedish studio applied a similar template to Game Workshop’s gritty sci-fi universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - PlayStation &amp; Grim Protocols Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqQH6IJgpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For the most part, it’s a great fit. Darktide delves deep into the dark underbelly of 40K, far away from the warring Space Marines and their xenos rivals, instead focusing on the spreading corruption of Chaos within the Hive City of Tertium. Here, hiding within a labyrinth of habitat zones, factories, and pleasure districts, sedition manifests in the form of mutant cults who have turned their backs on the Emperor, seeking salvation instead from dark and ancient deities.</p>
<p>One major difference between Darktide and Vermintide is the shift away from named playable heroes. Instead, you create your own avatar, choosing from one of four classes that each have their own distinct weapon loadouts and abilities though all are equally capable in combat. As you’d expect, the hulking Ogryn is a bullet sponge who excels in taunting foes and pulling aggro away from squishier squadmates such as the magic-wielding Psykers. Although Darktide gives you the tools to customise your own grimdark misfit, this isn’t to say they’re devoid of any character. In fact, there’s plenty to be gleaned about the 40K universe from the banter, barbs, and exchanges between heroes as they go about their Chaos-thumping crusade.</p>


<p>We won’t do a complete retread of our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Darktide review</a>, though what we praised about the game at launch still rings true. There’s an immense amount of joy to be had shooting and pummelling huge waves of enemies as you steadily push along each gauntlet-like stage, completing objectives. On the lowest rung of the difficulty ladder it can be presented as mindless fun though there’s plenty of challenge to be had, pressing even the most coordinated of strike teams to work together.</p>
<p>One common critique of Darktide is also still true. Repetition is pretty much baked into the core experience, encouraging players to rerun stages over and over, gradually dialling up the difficulty while earning experience points, as well as new weapons and abilities. This is a game about perfecting your ideal loadout rather than seeing a concise narrative unfold from beginning to end. Thanks to various updates and major content drops – including the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/cry-havoc-let-loose-the-grim-protocols-of-warhammer-40000-darktide/">Grim Protocols</a> – Darktide gives players much more to see and do while expanding the previously limited character progression system.</p>

<p>Through two years of toil and improvements, PlayStation fans get to experience Warhammer 40,000: Darktide at its very best complete with system-specific features such as DualSense haptics and a PS5 Pro performance boost. Online crossplay is another big boon, allowing you to matchmake with Xbox and PC players (something that was disappointingly absent from Vermintide 2). Speaking of which, Fatshark’s Skaven-stomping sequel is now long in the tooth and tail yet remains an ongoing success story within the blighted realm of live service video games – one that Darktide is looking to emulate.</p>
<p>Die hard fans have already managed to wring plenty of value from the game so far and there’s plenty of room to expand, though we doubt Fatshark will want to fragment its matchmaking pool by introducing premium maps. Having launched on all platforms, we’re eager to see what’s next as we go into 2025 and beyond, whether it’s new playable classes, enemies, and endgame modes.</p>

		<p><strong>Update 11AM 09/12</strong> – It looks like itch.io is back online, hopefully for good.</p>
<p><em>The original story follows.</em></p>


<hr>
<p>Popular indie game marketplace itch.io has been taken offline, the company blaming “bogus phishing reports” submitted AI brand protection used by Funko. Yeah. The plastic toys company…</p>
<p>Taking to <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829">social media</a>, the company explains:</p>
<p>I kid you not, itch.io has been taken down by [Funko] because they use some trash “AI Powered” Brand Protection Software called [BrandShield] that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain. […]
</p><p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it’s not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar’s automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>

<p>This is potentially a major headache for all the developers who rely on the platform. While itch.io is often a compliment to hosting and selling games on Steam in particular, it also has other opportunities that Steam doesn’t necessarily accommodate – it can host game jams, it’s great for prototyping and it’s DRM free.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is able to be resolved quickly, though itch.io say they will try to get a new domain if downtime lasts longer than 8 hours.</p>
<p>We’re probably going to wait this one out. We considered putting up a new domain but there are implications with third party services that make it not a trivial swap. In the meantime, if you know how to tweak your hosts file use: 45.33.107.166</p>
<p>It’s a situation that highlights the flaws of both “AI powered” automation and online copyright claims, which can often be used indiscriminately or extra-judiciously by large companies to take down things they don’t like, whether they have an actual case or not. Adding AI to the mix without human hands as a check and balance doesn’t exactly help the situation…</p>
