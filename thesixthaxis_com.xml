			<p>Sometimes a game just meshes so well with you that you feel as though the developers reached into your head just to get the idea for it. The first Heroes of Hammerwatch was one of those for me, and not just me either, but a group of my friends. The lovely graphical style, the music, the exceptional gameplay loop, the meta-progression, and perhaps most importantly the ability to play with as many players as you wanted, are still sublime. Well, Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is now out, and it’s basically all of that again, but with a new take on some classes, some new skills and systems here and there, and more awesome bosses to get beaten by.</p>

<p>Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is a roguelite action RPG, think original Diablo with more dying, that has you trying to fight off an evil cult. To do this, you have to venture out of the town you save and fight a bunch of stuff. You’re going to die a lot, but that’s very much the point. The overarching progression in Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 comes in a lot of forms.</p>


<p>Building up your town is a surefire way to unlock new upgrades for characters, new buffs to choose at the beginning of your run, and even ways to alter the dungeons you’ll be delving into. You can then keep levelling your character up to get new skills, upgrade their stats, and find equipment as well. Equipment is permanent, but in each run, you’ll also find trinkets to serve as passive boosts during just that run. So, you’ll always be more powerful by the end of a run, but whether that’s powerful enough to beat the game depends on how you started things.</p>


<p>Along with all of that, you unlock in-game achievements as you play the game that grant stat boosts, or extra points to spend on skills, and so on. Each class also grants a special buff that gets better the higher the level is, which means you’re encouraged to play every class, and each time you make a new character, they feel a lot stronger. It just all ties together really well, and makes for an incredibly engaging gameplay loop.</p>
<p>The seven character classes all feel varied too, with each one having its own skills and strengths, along with the skills that different weapons can give them, and then each of those has three subclasses too. You can respec basically all of this whenever you want too, which means that if you get a piece of gear you think could carry an entire build, you can switch it up and try it out.</p>

<p>When you add the ability to play with friends or strangers, and the ability to create lobbies as large as you want, you’ve got a game that just wants to be played, and will always reward you for doing so. Sometimes, you’ll pick your buffs to make sure you can gather resources to buff your town, sometimes to buff your character, and sometimes, you’ll choose violence.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even when you do eventually beat the game, you're then thrown into a new game plus cycle that means you can just keep playing and making your character stronger and stronger. It's such a blast to play. In fact, it's so good that I've been meaning to write this review for about a week now, but every time I think about Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 I seem to end up playing it instead. Speaking of which...	</p></div>

			<p>After an incredible year for indie horror in 2024, Dead of Darkness looks to continue the genre’s resurgence in the new year. At first sight, Dead of Darkness looks like it might be paying tribute to Konami’s classic series Silent Hill, with main character Miles sporting the obligatory grieving Dad uniform of beige jacket, jeans, and floppy hair parting, but the game itself is far more inspired by Capcom’s earlier Resident Evil.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead of Darkness - Story Trailer (2D Pixel Art Survival Horror Action Adventure)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jiS9Q9KZQZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin the game as burned out PI Miles Windham. After receiving a mysterious message recorded on a cassette (the game takes place in 1985) he sets out for Velvet Island in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Ireland. His unknown messenger claims to have information about the tragic fire that claimed the lives of Miles’ family. Mysterious and tragic backstory – check; unexpected journey to an isolated mansion – check; immediate meeting with a blonde woman who will probably be more than she first appears – hell yeah. This opening sounds clichéd but I think it’s more correct to consider it deliberate homage to the genre traditions. Dead of Darkness is clearly deeply immersed in the world of survival horror for better or for worse.</p>


<p>Dead of Darkness has a distinctive top down pixel aesthetic that feels straight out of the Super Nintendo days. The resultant lack of clear detail in the backgrounds is alleviated by the use of shiny circles to show where collectable items can be found – ironically the same tactic used in the highly detailed pre-rendered PS1 games.</p>


<p>While initially enemies are entirely made up of identical zombies, as the game progresses there are some wonderfully disgusting creatures waiting to eat your face off. The characters are nicely designed and the static figures used in dialogue sections look good too.</p>
<p>Audio is solid with suitably creepy moans and screams and a surprising amount of voice acting. I was taken aback, though, by how foul-mouthed the script is, with some characters throwing out the C-word like they’re auditioning for an Irish sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a>. I have no problem with strong language, but wasn’t expecting it here.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for Mile’s trip to take a turn for the worse and you quickly obtain a pistol that will be your main weapon for much of the game. Later on you’ll also obtain a shotgun, but I would have liked a little more variety in your arsenal beyond this. There are upgrades for both weapons which you’ll need to take out the more dangerous foes towards the end of the game. The positive to this limited arsenal is that it does help reduce the inventory management that is such a core aspect of the genre. Aside from some quests that require you to carry multiple items you can generally get by having both pistol, shotgun, and healing items at all times.</p>

<p>What initially seems to be a standard retread of familiar spooky mansion shenanigans becomes something far more interesting as the storyline develops. Yes, you have the inevitable sinister Umbrella-analogue corporation, but there is also a backstory that feels closer to folk and cosmic horror.</p>
<p>Alongside a lot of combat (with many narrow corridors not making evasion a workable strategy) there is the usual gamut of puzzles and key fetch quests. One neat addition here though is the use of Clues. Reading some files and notes can unlock Clues which you can use like objects to interact with the environment or your inventory. This is a great way to incentivise actually reading the notes and really brings the world of the game to life.</p>
<p>Less welcome are a bunch of instadeath timing puzzles that don’t quite gel with the top down perspective. Moving up the screen across retracting spikes when your character obscures the view is less than ideal, with one very late-game area being a particularly egregious example. I would also put the instadeath enemies in the bin as well, especially when the shotgun sometimes seems to fire through them and necessitate a game reload.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		All in all, Dead of Darkness is a great 2D Resident Evil tribute that brings plenty of its own ideas to the table. There could have been less reliance on instakills late in the game and the attempts to feed in some Eternal Darkness style sanity effects are underdone, but the core gameplay, the puzzles, and the twisting narrative are all well worth the price of entry.	</p></div>
