		<p>It looks like Square Enix are winding down support for Foamstars, their cartoony foam brawler.&nbsp; Someone at Square seems to have an ironic sense of humour as the final season is called “Party Goes On!”.</p>
<p>“In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customize shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future,” say Square Enix.</p>


<p>“All online services will remain available after the “PARTY GOES ON!” season ends. In addition, we plan to hold the FOAMSTARS CUP, a series of in-game events named after each character.<br>
Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy FOAMSTARS, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>

<p>The PS5 exclusive game went free to play in October this year but that doesn’t seem to have helped boost the popularity of the game.</p>

<p>Launched in February as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly game and PS4 and PS5 exclusive, before transitioning to being a moderately priced premium game in March. However, it seems that this hasn’t given the game a large enough community, pushing Square Enix to shift business models. An additional benefit of this change is that, as a free-to-play game, Foamstars will no longer require a PS Plus subscription in order to play online.</p>
<p>Foamstars was quickly pegged as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon</a> copycat by gamers, but introduced some quirky ideas alongside, such as being able to build up the foam into 3D structures, instead of just blanketing the level in your team’s colour.</p>
<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/12/foamstars-review-ps4-ps5-ps-plus/">Foamstars review</a>, Jim said, “Foamstars is a vibrantly inventive take on the hero shooter and Splatoon, though the bubble will quickly burst for those who can’t gel with its floaty, fluid-based gunplay.”</p>
