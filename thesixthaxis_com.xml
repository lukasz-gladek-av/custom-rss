		<p>There was a pleasant surprise for fans of Nintendo’s biggest hit of 2020, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> update 3.0.0 went live a day early!</p>
<p>Update 3.0.0 for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings a bunch of new features to the five year old game, alongside today’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> release and paid upgrade to bring more support for the new generation of Nintendo’s console. This update is all about the universal new features, with the paid DLC giving 4K support, Joy-Con 2 mouse mode and larger multiplayer lobbies to the game for Switch 2 players.</p>


<p>The free update has a major addition with a new resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel, but there’s also a big old list of quality of life improvements that includes an increased storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and the ability to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s now more! Nintendo hand-wave all of that previously announced stuff away and then include things like letting you craft using your home storage materials, purchasing up to 50 customization kits at once, additional Nook Miles tasks and more.</p>

			<p>The giant inflatable multi-coloured spider demon looms towards us. My co-op partner and I unleash a barrage of bubbles towards the beast, each bubble affixing to the ball-like structure of the creature, distorting it into a misshapen nightmare version of Bertie Bassett. Once three coloured bubble balls meet, in a match-3 style, they burst, leaving our opponent missing several legs and spasming on the ground. Akin to a daddy-long-legs that just fell afoul of a particularly vindictive three-year-old. With a final whimper, the boss explodes in a brightly coloured eruption. This is totally bonkers. This is Popucom.</p>
<p><iframe title="POPUCOM Nintendo Switch Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDm9YuO8y1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A third-person puzzle shooter, Popucom is intended to be played with a buddy in split-screen co-op. There’s a plot, but it amounts to little more than establishing the mission of rescuing dozens of little fried egg looking aliens. To do this, the players must navigate linear levels cram-packed with rather ingenious puzzles and colour coded bad guys made up of a load of balls.</p>


<p>With a series of bizarre inventions – including a drone flown by a kitten, force shields, teleportation devices and the ability to transform into a Nintendo-lawyer baiting Samus Aran ball – the two of you must work with something resembling synchronicity to overcome countless physics-based traps. Proceedings are tremendous fun, and all constructed around the simple premise of each player being able to switch between two colour types, and every interactable object or enemy to shoot being one of those corresponding four colours.</p>


<p>One moment, you’ll be in a purple colour configuration, walking along a purple path, holding aloft your force shield with your partner stood on top. They, in turn, are using their blue force shield to deflect blue laser beams, before switching to yellow mode to blast some yellow light-sabre wielding minion-looking dude. Suddenly, both the path and the laser beams change colour, and you and your buddy must quickly switch roles to prevent death by touching the wrong colour. It’s frenetic, furious, and often demanding, yet oh-so satisfying when you finally manage to clear a challenge that’s take several attempts.</p>
<p>The game starts off simple enough, but through the twelve hours of content, the difficulty soon rockets up, demanding swift reactions and expert off-screen communication to beat later levels. Thankfully, frustration is mostly alleviated by frequent and smartly placed checkpoints, though there will be some teeth-gnashing when a handful of particularly nasty challenges respawn you too far back, forcing you to get through a particularly tricky bit just to have another go at the trap that killed you.</p>

<p>Collision detection can be occasionally poor, with players slipping from a platform even though they just successfully made that tricky final leap. Indeed, jumping in general feels a little woolly, often failing to provide the responsiveness the game demands. Still, with numerous accessibility options to tweak, including activating temporary invulnerability and granting auto-aim, this is perfect family gaming, and something people of varying gaming abilities can enjoy.</p>
<p>Other than some notable frame rate drops when things get busy on screen, this is bright, bold, over-the-top brilliance. The sort of sunny fun that will effortlessly pass a rainy Sunday afternoon or two.</p>

		<p>Amazon have found their Kratos and he is not new to the God of War universe.&nbsp; Ryan Hurst will be playing the PlayStation icon, having previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok.</a></p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek games and beginning in Norse mythology, but one would assume they are going to have explain why Kratos is covered in white ash and has giant chains wrapped around his forearms.</p>


<p>Ryan Hurst is best known for playing Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and will be seen on the big screen later this year in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.</p>
<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence, having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>

<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-467828">Ryan Hurst</p>
<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>
