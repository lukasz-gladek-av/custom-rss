		<p>A few weeks on from the early access release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate-4">Skate</a>, EA and Full Circle have now revealed what’s coming in Season 1: Hesh &amp; Fresh, kickflipping off on 7th October.</p>

<p>The free-to-play reboot of the popular extreme sport series, Skate has taken players to the skate park paradise of San Vansterdam. Now the city is getting even bigger with new locations, weekly challenges, a skate pass with both free and premium reward tracs, and seasonal events for Halloween and Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Skateable Areas</strong>: Find seasonal decor at spots like The Orb and The Skateway plus other new areas for you to discover throughout San Van.</li>
<li><strong>New Events:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skate-o-Ween (Oct. 21 – Nov. 11): </strong>Skate-o-Ween in San Van is a lighthearted Halloween celebration that’s less about the spook and more about getting a chuckle, creating an inventive costume and just skating in a fun outfit.</li>
<li><strong>7-Ply Maple Harvest (Nov. 18 – Dec. 2): </strong>The annual San Van 7-Ply Maple Harvest is a long-standing festival celebrating the city’s unique maple trees; in the 70s, skaters discovered that the trees’ wood were perfectly suited for skateboard construction. It’s a community tradition rooted in accomplishments, growth, and reflection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Challenges and Tasks: </strong>Season 1 will introduce 40 new Challenges that will rotate in and out weekly. Players can also take on all-new daily, weekly, seasonal and event Tasks to earn Tix and unlock fresh rewards.</li>
<li><strong>New Brand Partners and Soundtrack Additions: </strong>New brands are joining the in-game store, including NHS’s Santa Cruz, Independent and Creature. Season 1 also brings 21 new songs with a 90’s vibe – featuring tracks from Bad Religion, Dinosaur Jr., Ice Cube and more. The full track drops soon!</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Update and skate.Pass: </strong>Launching alongside Season 1 is the brand new Lighting Update and skate.Pass, which you can read more about in <strong><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six">The Grind Vol. 6.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Skate might technically be in early access, but the game is free-to-play and available across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>
