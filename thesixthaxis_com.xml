		<p>As tradition, the PSN January Sale has kicked off before Christmas so it can tempt you to spend those PSN Gift cards straight away.&nbsp; Also as tradition, the savings depend on where you are in the world so there’s no easy way to collate them all but hopefully this should give you an idea of what’s on offer.</p>
<p>The final tradition is that the banner adverts on the store lie, you can actually save up to 90%, not 75%.</p>


<p>There are some really good offers this time, especially if you are picking up older games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-ultimate-edition/">Control: Ultimate Edition</a> is cheaper than a pint and under £6 so if you have not played that, then you really should grab it, and I can also recommend <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep: The Complete Edition</a>, which is a few pennies over £13. You are also completely mad if you don’t pick up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/limbo/">Limbo</a> AND Inside for £2.19.</p>
<p>A word of warning, the store is still packed full of rubbish shovelware, but if you really want to jack up your Platinum trophy count then Beanball is on sale for seven pence – yes, 7p – and you can get the Plat in 5 mins.</p>
<p>More recent games with savings include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f/">Silent Hill f</a>, <span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, and ARC Raiders. I think I am going to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch/">Dispatch.</a></span></p>
