		<p>The next big update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will arrive on 26th June, adding a new Siege game mode, new cosmetics and more. This will be another free update for the game across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>Siege mode is a new endless PvE challenge. Set on Kadaku, the 3-player game mode pits you against increasingly challenging waves of Tyranid and Chaos enemies as they assault an Imperial fortress. While death and failure is inevitable, fighting for as long as possible is admirable in its own right.</p>
<p>Siege mode will be playable on the Public Test Server on PC from 4th June, with more details coming in the next Community Update.</p>
<p>Alongside the Siege Mode, Patch 9 will also bring two new customisation DLCs for Ultra Edition, Gold Edition, and Season Pass holders. This adds the White Scars Chapter Pack with a new Champion skin and three White Scars inspired weapon skins. Much more popular will be the Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack, with a selection of armour pieces that can be added to any Space Marine classes, as well as heraldry markings for the Blood Angels’ Successor Chapters.</p>

<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this month’s modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

		<p>Two classic Warhammer 40,000 games are getting fresh remastered releases this year. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition is coming later this year to PC, while Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition is launching on 10th June for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass.</p>
<p>Relic Entertainment’s Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War was a fantastic take on the RTS genre when it launched in 2004, with the game receiving four expansions in the years that followed. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition brings all of that together and gives it a technical spruce up to make it more compatible with modern systems and give it a little graphical spit and polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will feature 4K support, upscaled textures to 4x the originals, and adds in image-based lighting for increased fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have also been improved, and unit now have gloss and emissive lighting. There’s also an improved gameplay camera and the HUD has been optimised for widescreen.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the game has been upgraded with 64-bit support, making it much more compatible with modern operating systems and CPUs. This should allow the modding community to flourish and take the game to new heights.</p>

<p>. An improved gameplay camera will show the battlefield like never before and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. It has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods.</p>
<p>But it’s really Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 that is still in the forefront of gamer’s consciousness for this grim dark universe, and so the only thing surprising about a Space Marine remaster is that it’s taken Sega this long! Launching on 10th June, the original Space Marine has been enhanced by SneakyBox.</p>

<p>“Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a thoughtful restoration,” said Producer Vaidas Mikelskas from SneakyBox.</p>

<p>The game will now support 4K resolutions, has modernised controls and an overhauled UI, there’s also improved character models and remastered audio – Ork models now align with modern Ork factions and have 100 new voice lines added, for example. Also, the game has 64-bit support on Windows.</p>
<p>Best of all, this release still has online multiplayer support, keeping the original 8v8 online servers up and running.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising that there’s no PS5 release, though…</p>
