		<p>Auroch Digital has announced a sequel to their well-received Warhammer 40K boomer shooter. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving your Space Marine a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way.</p>
<p>Building on the combat of the first game, you’ll still be able to charge straight into battle with the chainsword in hand, and a wide arsenal of 40K weapons to blast them with. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

<p>The first game is currently available within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/may-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-features-balatro-boomer-shooting-dinos/">PS Plus Monthly Games for May 2025</a>.</p>

		<p>Owlcat Games has announced that their next game, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, is now in development. This CRPG will tell a new story within the Calixis Sector, the same region of space that was featured in their last game, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmfu_Spm-6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s some of the announcement blurb:</p>
<p><em>By the decree of the Holy Inquisition, you have been chosen for a perilous mission that will dictate the future of the Calixis Sector. Become an agent of the Holy Golden Throne and hunt down all those who would dare stray from the Emperor’s light. Hold fast to your duty, eradicate the enemies of the Imperium and battle the horrors of the void in the long-anticipated Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy!</em></p>
<p><em>Explore the Warhammer 40,000 universe like you’ve never seen it before! Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is an upcoming turn-based CRPG with a unique and thrilling narrative that follows the shadowy agents of the Inquisition. Take on the mantle of an Inquisitor, and use every tool at your disposal to root out corruption, sedition and heresy, bringing the Emperor’s wrath to those who would see the Imperium fall. Hunt down clues, investigate mysteries, and uncover vile conspiracies.</em></p>

<p>Playing as an Inquisitor will afford you extraordinary privileges within the 40K grim dark universe. In particular, Inquisitors have the freedom to align themselves with alien races, if this prove beneficial to your mission. Five companions have been revealed alongside the announcement including the medical specialist Epione Spes, Catachan fighter Haymaar Devos, and the Ogryn Conscript 0-118-B (AKA Cogg). However, there’s also a Kroot warrior, Ra’akhti, and and Eldar Cosair, Laarthyr Cainareth.</p>
<p>If Rogue Trader is anything to go by, this is going to be another vast CRPG from Owlcat, with Rogue Trader promising over 130 hours of game time. Of course, there’s even more game time if you account for the 15-ish hours each in Void Shadows and Lex Imperialis. This second expansion is set to release on 26th June, so the announcement of Dark Heresy is perfectly timed to make the studio’s shift between projects.</p>

		<p>The next big update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will arrive on 26th June, adding a new Siege game mode, new cosmetics and more. This will be another free update for the game across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Siege mode is a new endless PvE challenge. Set on Kadaku, the 3-player game mode pits you against increasingly challenging waves of Tyranid and Chaos enemies as they assault an Imperial fortress. While death and failure is inevitable, fighting for as long as possible is admirable in its own right.</p>
<p>Siege mode will be playable on the Public Test Server on PC from 4th June, with more details coming in the next Community Update.</p>
<p>Alongside the Siege Mode, Patch 9 will also bring two new customisation DLCs for Ultra Edition, Gold Edition, and Season Pass holders. This adds the White Scars Chapter Pack with a new Champion skin and three White Scars inspired weapon skins. Much more popular will be the Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack, with a selection of armour pieces that can be added to any Space Marine classes, as well as heraldry markings for the Blood Angels’ Successor Chapters.</p>

<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this month’s modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two classic Warhammer 40,000 games are getting fresh remastered releases this year. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition is coming later this year to PC, while Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition is launching on 10th June for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass.</p>
<p>Relic Entertainment’s Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War was a fantastic take on the RTS genre when it launched in 2004, with the game receiving four expansions in the years that followed. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition brings all of that together and gives it a technical spruce up to make it more compatible with modern systems and give it a little graphical spit and polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will feature 4K support, upscaled textures to 4x the originals, and adds in image-based lighting for increased fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have also been improved, and unit now have gloss and emissive lighting. There’s also an improved gameplay camera and the HUD has been optimised for widescreen.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the game has been upgraded with 64-bit support, making it much more compatible with modern operating systems and CPUs. This should allow the modding community to flourish and take the game to new heights.</p>

<p>. An improved gameplay camera will show the battlefield like never before and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. It has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods.</p>
<p>But it’s really Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 that is still in the forefront of gamer’s consciousness for this grim dark universe, and so the only thing surprising about a Space Marine remaster is that it’s taken Sega this long! Launching on 10th June, the original Space Marine has been enhanced by SneakyBox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition | Announce Trailer [EN PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12D1xaoEqGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a thoughtful restoration,” said Producer Vaidas Mikelskas from SneakyBox.</p>

<p>The game will now support 4K resolutions, has modernised controls and an overhauled UI, there’s also improved character models and remastered audio – Ork models now align with modern Ork factions and have 100 new voice lines added, for example. Also, the game has 64-bit support on Windows.</p>
<p>Best of all, this release still has online multiplayer support, keeping the original 8v8 online servers up and running.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising that there’s no PS5 release, though…</p>
