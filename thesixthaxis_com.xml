		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

		<p>Still riding the highs of the success of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team has released a new dev diary to reveal more about their upcoming original horror game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Co-directors Jacek Zieba and Wojciech Piejko gave us a tour of this setting. Amongst the inspirations are games like Dead Space and the challenge of Dark Souls, while movies such as Twelve Monkeys also provide some similar tones. The unusual looking suit for the Traveller is intended to look a bit like a deep sea diver, the heavy plates and the large dome-like helmet in particular. You’ll need that armour to survive encounters with the Orphans, the twisted human forms of what is left of humanity from this time, delving into a bit of body horror.</p>
<p>There’s some small snippets of gameplay within the dev diary, but Bloober say that a broader gameplay reveal will likely be coming soon.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/fbc-firebreak-gameplay-reveals-a-new-supernatural-threat-sticky-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> will launch this summer for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, shared a healthy dose of gameplay and revealed one of the big supernatural dangers you’ll face in the game: Sticky Notes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jobs and Gameplay – FBC: Firebreak (Community First Look)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Oh sure, yellow sticky notes seem innocuous enough to you and me, their small size (often cut into cute shapes these days) and weak glue making them mildly useful, but in The Oldest House and with the Hiss still running rampant? Well, haunted sticky notes are a real problem. The gameplay reveal for FBC: Firebreak focuses on this Job, a crisis-filled mission that will take you to the Executive Sector of the Federal Bureau of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. This mission, titled Paper Chase, is just one of many to take on in the game, with the sole objective to destroy as many sticky notes as possible. Other missions might have you try to find mannequin ski instructors and load them onto a paranatural ski lift…</p>
<p>With three-player PvE co-op at its heart, you’ll have three saved loadouts to choose from, Crisis Kits, which are themed around a particular tool and playstyle. You’ll then pick the Threat Level and Clearance Level of a Job, determining the difficulty of enemies and then the complexity and length of the mission.</p>
<p>The trailer and dev diary both show plenty of what you’ll expect to face. There’s regular Hiss zombie-type enemies, bomb squad Hiss with much heavier armour, and then humanoid forms constructed entirely of sticky notes. There’s even a giant Sandman-like boss to battle. One thing you’ll have to be wary of is getting covered with sticky notes yourself, with allies able to wash you down or showers dotted around the world to do the same – albeit at the cost of slowing you down for a bit from the cold water, unless you fix the heaters for the showers.</p>

<p>In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.&nbsp;There’s plenty of Left 4 Dead vibes to the action here, with safe rooms helping to provide some structure to the levels, and the need to defend from alerted enemies.</p>
<p>Remedy has already confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be available day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, PC Game Pass, PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium. In addition to this, they’ve now confirmed that all playable content will be available to all players for free, meaning any new levels will be playable for all. There’s no word on monetisation outside of that, but Remedy will share those details another time.</p>

		<p>Developer Path Games has announced its next game and it is called Dark Mass. Much like its previous game Insomnis, Dark Mass is a first person horror title but it swaps a regular, land based mansion for a manor that is deep underwater in the middle of the sea. How did it get there? Well, that’s one of the mysteries. The announcement trailer gives a sense of what to expect in this unusual deep sea dive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Mass - Announcement Trailer | 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2sv9NAia24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dark Mass puts you in the role of deep sea explorer Alice who, along with her brother Reed, set off to to explore a ship wreck. However, they instead find the out of place manor that still retains much of its identity, despite being on the sea bed. Alice soon becomes trapped within the manor and has to solve its puzzle and avoid the horrors that still inhabit the house, including the monster Silas, who stalks Alice through the manor. Throughout the story, Alice maintains contact with Reed, who is on the boat, through a walkie talkie. Navigating through the manor will be slow at times as Alice’s movement is impacted by the deep sea currents. The story will have multiple choices with these leading to different endings.</p>
<p>A release date for Dark Mass is yet to be confirmed, but it is expected at some point this year.</p>
