		<p>Square Enix wasn’t content to reveal just one HD-2D game, and has also announced Octopath Traveler 0, a prequel to the title that originated this art style, which is coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klKrQZXDWkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Embark on an adventure of your own creation,” reads the trailer blurb. “Start from zero in a quest of restoration and retribution! Confront powerful villains and rebuild your hometown in OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – a new entry in the HD-2D series.”</p>
<p>For the first time, you’ll be able to create your protagonist in this series, but will still be gathering a large party of fellows to journey with you.</p>
<p>There’s also a new town-building side to the game, which is glimpsed in just moments from the trailer, which could be really interesting.</p>

<p>We loved the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, with Reuben saying “Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, a Switch 2 exclusive branch of the HD-2D visual style, embracing it for an action RPG.</p>
