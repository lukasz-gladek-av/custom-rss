		<p>Mutliverse has announced that it is delaying the launch of its colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid PAX Autocratica by a month to address performance, stability, and balancing issues that have been raised. Initially, PAX Autocratica was going to launch on February 2nd into early access, but now it will launch on March 4th instead.</p>

<p>In a statement the dev team at Multiverse said, <em>“After review by the Supreme Council, a directive has been issued regarding the deployment of Pax Autocratica. <wbr>The Early Access launch has been rescheduled to March 4, 2026. This decision was not made lightly. Recent internal evaluations and field reports have identified several areas that require further refinement before the State is ready to open Early Access operations. <wbr>These include:<wbr><wbr><wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Core balancing adjustments<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Stability and performance improvements<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Initial onboarding and tutorial refinement</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, we have received a significant number of Quality of Life requests that we intend to address Our objective remains unchanged: <wbr>to launch Early Access with a build that is stable and fully enjoyable.”</em></p>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also previously confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse has previously made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em>&nbsp;“1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark has released a new update for ARC Raiders, and while update 1.11.0 is not a big one it does come off the back of a big milestone. Embark has confirmed that since launch ARC Raiders has had 12 million players, and that everyone who has logged into the game since launch up to January 13th would be gifted a gilded pickaxe raider tool. The update itself addresses a key card exploit so players can no longer keep them after use, and balancing changes to a couple of weapons. There is also the launch of the Abyss cosmetic set.</p>

<h2>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kettle – <wbr>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
<li>Trigger ‘Nade – Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
<li><wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.<wbr></li>
<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our ARC Raiders review, Tuffcub said, <em>“ARC Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Traveller’s Refrain Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/travellers-refrain-review/</link>
            <guid>1405426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Traveller’s Refrain is a game that will make you feel sleepy. I don’t mean to suggest the game is boring, far from it. Rather, this isometric Zelda-like has a meditative thoughtful vibe that brings on a state of mindful chill that could, just could, make you briefly close your eyes. For a few minutes. Just make sure you’ve got your little wrist holders on to avoid any unnecessary damage to your Switch when you nod off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Traveler's Refrain - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXhR--g3f9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Traveller is a rather mysterious fellow with a lovely, well-trimmed beard. Awaking in a dream-like forest, with memories of past traumatic events clearly haunting him, our surprisingly trendy hero must journey on a quest of discovery, learning more about himself and this world he now inhabits in the process. </p>


<p>If this all sounds a little navel-gazing for you don’t worry, developer Red Essence Games smartly follow the show-don’t-tell model, getting out of the players’ way for the most part and keeping dialogue brief. As such, you pick up on the melancholic mindful elements in brief breaks between all the action, rather than being subsumed in sadness by never-ending dialogue.</p>
<p>Exploration and puzzling are where Traveller’s Refrain excels. Puzzles are basic but satisfying, demanding you find and light all the beacons, as an early example. It’s nothing you haven’t solved before, but these puzzles are well delivered. Even better, there are some fascinatingly fresh characters to encounter, many unlike anything I’ve encountered before in an RPG. </p>


<p>Visually distinctive, meeting new NPCs is the real drive behind your journeying. It also helps that everything looks sumptuous too, the hard-drawn cartoon aesthetic is brimming with details, and full of flair, creating a distinctive game world to explore. No mean feat when your game is set in a forest, likely the most done to death setting in all of video gamedom. That and ice levels, I guess.</p>
<p>Combat is reminiscent of a calmer version of Hades. Traveller can dodge dash with the best of them, nimbly avoiding flailing stone golems, sentient giant blobs of gloop and enormous plumes of flames. Armed with numerous close combat weapons over the course of this sixteen-hour adventure, the risk-reward of Traveller’s Refrain’s combat is clear, the player must get in close to dish out damage, before rapidly escaping enemy reprisal. </p>
<p>That’s not the only weapon at Traveller’s disposal, as he can also strum out a tune or two on his guitar. Basically, his wizard book, spells are summoned by flicks of the thumb stick in different directions. The player has to remember these, rather then being constantly prompted, though you can remind yourself of the inputs in Traveller’s song book. As such, there’s a delightful sense of risk as Traveller stands still to strum his guitar in the middle of a bunch of foes in a desperate attempt to heal himself. Get it wrong and it’s game over, get those inputs right, and you have a chance.</p>

<p>It’s exciting stuff, with hordes of enemies on-screen at anyone time. Though this isn’t without its problems, as Traveller may be fast and smooth in his movements, but the frame rate on Switch 1 certainly isn’t. In handheld mode, the game is almost unplayable at times. Even when there’s no onscreen fireworks, and Traveller is simply running back and forth, the frame rate chugs along like a particularly decrepit diesel train. Docked is better, of course, but the frame rate still struggles far more often than it should. Which is a real shame, as there’s some great Zelda-akin puzzling and exploration to be had here.</p>

		<p>Former Xbox spokesperson, Larry Hryb, more commonly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/major-nelson/">Major Nelson</a>, has announced that he has been laid off and lost his job Unity.</p>
<p>“As many of you have been with me during my career in gaming, I’d like to share personal news. Like many in the gaming space recently, I’ve been laid off from Unity,” he wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me">BlueSky.</a> “After leaving Microsoft, I joined the Unity team in 2024. I am proud of the goals my team and I accomplished in just 18 months, and I am grateful for the creators and teams I had the chance to support. Now, I am excited to explore the next chapter.”</p>


<p>“I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships. I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</p>
<p>He is part of the latest in a&nbsp; long line of redundancies at game engine developer Unity, with over 25% of the staff being laid off at a cost of over $205 million.</p>
<p>The company suffered a huge backlash in 2023 when it instituted a “runtime fee” that, if &nbsp;a game reached specific revenue and lifetime installation thresholds, the publishers would pay a fee for every installation.&nbsp; Previously, developers only had to pay a license fee for the engine. When it became clear that the fee would apply to older games that were updated there was another backlash, but in response, Unity only changed some of the terms of the new payment plan.</p>

<p>The furore continued until Unity finally backed down, announcing they would be discontinuing the runtime fee model – but would be increasing the pricing of the original license instead.</p>
<p>Unity is used by many mobile developers, and the vast majority of VR games are created using the engine.</p>
<p>We wish Larry all the best for the future.</p>
