<p>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac is a faithful remake of the early 2000s 3D platformer. The Ghosts have snuck into Pac-Village and stolen the Golden Fruit, freeing their ghost king, Spooky, and forcing Pac-Man to travel the lands to reclaim the fruit and foil his plans.</p>
<p>Originally released for PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC, the game is getting a serious glow up with this remake, with Now Production giving a solid modernised take on the source levels and themes, adding a ton more detail and more nuanced lighting.</p>
<p>But it goes beyond that, as they promise new actions for Pac-Man, updated boss battles,&nbsp;characters, collectables, customisations, and a 2-player mode.</p>
