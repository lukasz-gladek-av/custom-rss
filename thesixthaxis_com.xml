		<p>The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it.</p>

<p>After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch">Dispatch</a> has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years.</p>


<p>Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look.</p>
<h3>Hades II – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-ii">Hades II</a> does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system.</p>

<p>Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Ball X Pit – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a> is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls.</p>

		<p>Slavic Magic has released a major new update for Manor Lords, its medieval strategy game, with the update adding a new option to choose starting locations, new maps, new buildings and jobs associated with them, ladder climbing for units, and a whole host of changes for resources. Additionally, policies have been removed temporarily from Manor Lords as they require additional development time. You can check out the full list of changes below.</p>

<h2>Manor Lords Update 5 Version 0.8.029–0.8.050 patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Starting Location Selection</b>: Ability to select the starting location in the game setup screen for the player and adversaries.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Maps</b>: Devil’s Hill, Jagged Cliffs, Divided and Lake Lemm.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Game Modes</b>: Duel (1 vs 1 with AI) and Fractured Realm (4 Lord free-for-all).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Buildings, Jobs &amp; Resources</b>: Quarry, Stonemason, Lime Kiln, and their connected resources: Rough Stone, Dressed Stone, Mortar.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Positioning</b>: A new system for positioning units on walls.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Ladder Climbing</b>: Units now climb ladders to access higher floors.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Hover Fortifications</b>: The player can now hover the castle fortifications and see the soldiers inside.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Gate Control</b>: Added the ability to open and close each castle gate individually.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Castle Upgrade System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Module Upgrades</b>: Every castle module, including walls and gates, can now be upgraded to lv2.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Placement Logic</b>: Module placement is no longer restricted by distance to the nearest major module. The planner now displays the total Bailey Area. The Bailey area allowed for construction is limited by your lord’s or lady’s Rank (still WIP).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Platforms</b>: You can now attach platforms to the castle walls. The level of platforms is capped by the wall type.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Affinity System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Environment Types</b>: Each Region is divided by area into multiple Environment Types: (Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Urban, Rural).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Building Affinities</b>: Different buildings can have Affinities with different Environment Types, for instance, the Animal Pen has a “Pannage” Affinity which decreases the time to yield for Pig Pens relative to the Woodland area.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maintenance System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Workplace Maintenance</b>: A lot of workplaces now must be maintained by delivering resources to function properly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Failure Risks</b>: Failure to maintain a building can result in various risks, such as collapse for mines, injury and even a minor death chance.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rate Tuning</b>: You can tune a workplace’s level of maintenance, affecting Labor Speed.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yield System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yield Definition</b>: Yield is a measure of how much your workplace produces. Various buildings use different timespans and benchmark values depending on their nature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Yield Influencers</b>: Yield can be affected by Labor Speed, Efficiency, and Productivity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Labor Speed</b>: Labor Speed measures how fast your workers perform workplace related tasks.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Efficiency</b>: Efficiency measures how much output you get per input when crafting, per plant when farming or per passive income cycle, depending on the production type. High Efficiency means your Gardens will produce more Vegetables and your Crafting tasks may produce extra items.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Productivity</b>: Productivity is a measure of your logistics: transport and labor times vs idle times, sickness, extension work and militia assignments.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Approval Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory Weight Shift</b>: Approval memory weight was shifted to dramatically favor current events versus past events.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Approval Tiers</b>: There are now 7 approval Tiers. Landing in a specific Approval Tier will give various penalties and bonuses to growth, influence, income among others.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Food Resource Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Food Categories</b>:All foods now fit within food categories; Foraged Goods, Meats, Fishes, Vegetables, Grains and Animal Produce.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Burgage Plot Requirement overhaul</b>: Burgage Plots now require a variety of foods from different categories, encouraging more diverse variety as they upgrade.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Vegetables</b>: Vegetables resource was split into Cabbages, Carrots and Beetroots.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Orchards</b>: In addition to Apples, Pears and Quinces were added as new Orchard options.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Meats</b>: Meat was divided into: Mutton, Chevon, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Small Game, and is produced by their respective animals accordingly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Fish</b>: Fish was divided into Carp (from ponds) and Eel (from rivers).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Food:</b>&nbsp;Milk is passively produced by Goats for the Animal Produce category.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wild Animals</b>: Deer were replaced by Small Game since it’s more plausible in historical terms. Small Game also yields Pelts, which is an early trade commodity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Foraged Goods</b>: Alongside Berries, Mushrooms have been reintroduced as a Foraged Good.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Honey</b>: Honey is no longer consumed. It is intended for use in a future update, but for now can be sold, while the Apiary Extension boosts the yield of Farms and Orchards through the Pollination Affinity.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Regional Development System Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development Perks</b>: To a lot of players, the development tree was a weak point of the game and described as immersion breaking. Therefore, a new, more grounded system of Development Perks has been introduced. The player will now face more realistic choices at each settlement level and those choices reflect the settlement development stage.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Perk Design</b>: The perks are also designed to be more nuanced from a game design perspective so that choices are less immediately obvious, but compound into strong specializations over time.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rollout Status</b>: Since it’s still in progress, only the first batch of perks (Origins) is available.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Policies</b>: Policies are temporarily removed (still undergoing rework).<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>General:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a lot of chance based mechanics in favor of more deterministic calculations to make yield balance more predictable (this includes farming and mining which used to be chance based).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Yields are more linear as Orchard Trees and Field Crops mature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Moved consumption &amp; approval data to the Family structure instead of storing it on husbands (this was a temporary workaround to represent per family consumption and approval effects).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Since individual villagers no longer have a consumption update, we also moved the disease data to the Family structure. As a side effect, whole families will now get sick together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Fishing nodes often spawn in rivers now (allowing river fishing).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Streams now use the river system and therefore will spawn small bridges.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new Elevation overlay for use with Farming and Livestock.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Replaced the Brewery extension placeholder.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an additional road to Wirnitz in Germanic Valley<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an extra hard cap for storage distribution limits, eg. if a stall has 21 items for some reason but only 20 storage space, the extra item will not count as supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality of Life Improvements:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a “Protect Resource Area” checkbox for the Logging Camp and Firewood Cutter which makes workers automatically avoid deforestation near vulnerable resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Worker families assigned to a building being upgraded will now participate in the construction.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber for construction will get the nearest log instead of nearest on the ground before from buildings.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber will now prioritize delivering to a target near where the Timber is picked up.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Blocked sons with jobs from refueling the home if there is a female family member without any task that can do it instead.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Workplace animals will now be assigned a home as close as possible to the workplace.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When debranching a tree, Workers will always pick the one closest to them.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When cutting down a tree, Workers will pick the nearest one, unless too far away from the Logging Camp.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Changed order of goods produced for Blacksmith and Joiner to list Spears and Large shields first.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Artisans will start producing the first listed good when their workshop is built.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Trading Post Workers will now only use Horses that are assigned to their Trading Post (Horses are automatically assigned when they arrive).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Due to tester feedback, storage building workers supply their Stalls from their own Storehouse/Granary only.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When taking care of the dead, bodies will now be moved to the nearest Corpse Pit or Church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Manor Specific:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Manors no longer have families living in them (since Manors aren’t residential and can’t fulfil requirements it was always a bit weird).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When castle modules are placed on a wall, they will split the wall and snap the walls to edges instead of clipping with the module.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an option to join 2 walls into 1 after you snap their ends together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added missing wall snapping points to the outer towers.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When rotating a module, the attached walls should now stay attached. The rotation is limited if a module has wall connections.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Castle modules now collide with each other when placing in order to avoid building areas impossible for pathfinding and reduce clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adjustments:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated some jobs since they no longer were fitting the game design: Removed Dye and Dyer in their previous implementation. Removed Firewood Cart and Food Cart.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Cloaks are removed, instead, there are two recipes for producing Clothes – either from Wool or from Linen.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Apiary is now a backyard extension. Wax is now produced every third cycle from an Apiary.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the “Fence up” Upgrade from fields since it’s a leftover of the previous development tree and doesn’t quite fit anymore.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Temporary removal of the “Force Early Harvest” button in the Farmhouse.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Granary workers no longer supply Windmills since it was inconsistent with all the other workplaces needing to get their own crafting resources.<br>
<wbr></li>

</ul>
<p><b>Technical:</b><br>

<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Burgage Plots &amp; Families:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of Vegetable Gardens and Orchards scale based on the size of the Extension Area. This can be viewed as the “Planting Cost” when placing the Burgage Plot.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Vegetable Gardens need to be replowed and replanted after harvest.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Chicken (meat) is now produced every fourth cycle from a Chicken Coop, while Milk is produced from Goats with Chevon and Hides every third cycle.<br>

<wbr></li>
<li>Removed Tool cost from all Artisan Workshops as Maintenance replaces it.<br>
<wbr></li>

		<p>Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Latest In the Jungle DLC News, 2025 Recaps &amp; More! | DEV DIVE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5_pWDFRca0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill.</p>
<p>When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.</p>

		<p>Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified.</p>
