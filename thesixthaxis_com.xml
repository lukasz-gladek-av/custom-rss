			<p>It’s the big Four-Oh for Mario, and while that would signal a bit of a midlife crisis in many men, he’s already taken up all manner of sports, been an avid kart racer for decades, and even spends many a weekend playing board games. What else to do, then, but reminisce about that time he went to space in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2?</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmwOnsJoj8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This pair of games are rightly held up as two of the very best platformers of all time. Those opening hours of Mario Galaxy are still an absolute delight as you bounce between small celestial bodies, run any and all directions around oddly shaped planetoids and structures, head into a strange space pill for some gravity-shifting 2D platforming, and then still find that there’s more traditional feeling Mario levels as well. Well, about as traditional as you can be when you turn into Bee Mario and have to clamber around on a queen bee. Super Mario Galaxy 2 showed just how fertile this platforming concept was, adding Yoshi into the gameplay mix, using his tongue to grab things with the pointer, new power ups, and more.</p>


<p>Remastering these two beloved platformers is no small feat. One of the problems with Nintendo’s more experimental phase starting with the Wii and DS is how difficult it can be to translate their Wiimote pointer and touchscreen to more typical controllers. Mario Galaxy was built with the screen pointer in mind, to gobble up star chunks, fire them at enemies and interactive objects, grab onto items on screen and to trigger spin moves with a quick waggle (with a button press backup). It becomes even more integral in Galaxy 2 as you often rely on Yoshi to gobble things up and grab things with his tongue.</p>


<p>None of that’s a problem for the Switch or Switch 2, with motion sensors built into all the official controllers, and playing on a TV with Joy-Con in hand, moving with the left stick and pointing with your right hand, does a great job of capturing that original Wii feel – just tie the wrist straps together for a truly authentic Wiimote and nunchuck experience. The one thing missing is that you can’t use your right hand as a mouse pointer, which is reserved only for a player 2. I guess this might have required a few too many button remapping gymnastics. Playing with a Switch Pro Controller also works great, though it feels a bit more clumsy to be tilting both hands together to move that cursor.</p>
<p>The real pain point for the 35th anniversary 3D All-Stars rendition of Mario Galaxy came with the handheld experience. Here, instead of letting you tilt the console to move a pointer, you were forced to lift a hand and touch the screen to interact. That’s still an option with these 40th anniversary remasters, but now you can use motion as well.</p>

<p>The handheld experience is just one sign of a remaster that digs deeper and goes much further to make these two games feel as native as possible. It extends to many more areas as well, so while the menus still look and feel like Nintendo Wii menus with gigantic buttons you can point at or touch, the cursor can also snap to buttons when using an analogue stick. New and revised game options are built into the game’s menus instead of a Switch Online-like emulator overlay, you’re no longer prompted to save after every level completion, and there’s a whole new Assist mode that modifies the game with more health for Mario, health recovery when standing still, and easy recoveries from falls into oblivion.</p>
<p>And then there’s the graphical improvements. On Switch 2, you now have 1080p when playing handheld and a 4K output to TV. Nintendo’s aversion to anti-aliasing remains, but when the resolutions match your screens, it feels better, and it’s paired with revamped textures that generally feel like someone’s wiped the Vaseline off your glasses – other petroleum jellies are also available to smear on your glasses. Grass textures go from mottled colours to having more distinct shaped patches, or there’s now a checkerboard pattern overlaid on the sky of the Honeyhive Galaxy.</p>

<p>Is it perfect? Not quite. There are some texture swaps that shift in what feels like a less detailed direction, and there’s also places that aren’t improved, like Captain Toad’s very low poly count model, and I’d argue that the Switch 2 in particular should be able to handle a longer draw distance and remove some more shadow pop in.</p>
<p>I also feel like the pre-rendered cutscenes could have had a bigger improvement. They’ve been re-rendered and have an opened up aspect ratio, but they still come off as being relatively low resolution from the massive amounts of depth of field in place. Still, this is a generally handsome set of remaster works that (judging by the initial reaction to the announcement thinking that it was a simple upscaling) does a great job of capturing what you remember these games as having looked like 15+ years ago.</p>

<p>There’s not too much more to this bundle beyond that – a new storybook in Galaxy 2, for example – and that’s part of why the £34/$40 per game and £59/$70 combined pricing might feel steep. In truth, it’s in keeping with the Metroid Prime remaster, per game, and if you’re still into physical games, you can get a good few quid off that way.</p>

		<p>The use of AI is one of the most contentious points in modern culture, as people lean on it more and more, for everything from research and programming through to fashion tips and companionship. Within gaming and the wider arts, its use to replace voice actors and other professionals has opened up questions about putting hard-working actors out of work, and where these AI models have been trained – almost certainly on copyrighted material that has not approved that use. SAG-AFTRA, the labour union that represents 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists, influencers and other entertainment and media professionals, has made a fresh statement on where they stand on the use of AI performers.</p>
<p>The following statement was released following the announcement of “Tilly Norwood,” an A.I.-generated “actor” that is reportedly seeking representation:</p>


<p>“SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.</p>
<p>“To be clear, “Tilly Norwood” is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any “problem” — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.</p>
<p>“Additionally, signatory producers should be aware that they may not use synthetic performers without complying with our contractual obligations, which generally require notice and bargaining whenever a synthetic performer is going to be used.”</p>

<p>This conversation isn’t going to go away any time soon. AI should be used to improve and ease humanity’s daily struggles, not replace our artistic and creative ventures.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[UBOAT Console Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/30/uboat-console-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uboat-console-review.1312234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Styling itself as a spiritual successor to the popular Silent Hunter series, UBOAT is a World War II submarine sim that places you in command of your own crew, patrolling the North Sea. Developed by Deep Water Studio, it offers a rich, detailed simulation that, like most games in the genre, comes with a steep learning curve with many plates to spin. Console players will also have to contend with inherently awkward controls, sifting through menus and action screens that were clearly designed for keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="UBOAT - Full Release Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pu93U02aUjo?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can jump into one of several campaigns, each taking place during different flashpoints as the war rages across Europe. This timeline will determine several factors, such as the occupation of various ports and territories, as well as the availability of more advanced torpedoes. Whatever campaign you choose, and whichever submarine you start with, there’s no option to change your faction. As the name implies, UBOAT is focused on the Kriegsmarine, which naturally means playing from the perspective of Nazi Germany.</p>


<p>UBOAT wants you to develop an intimate knowledge of the vessel under your command. Actions that sound relatively simple, such as mapping a course, scanning for enemies, or firing a torpedo, each require several steps to complete, with various factors and resource checks determining their success. For example, attempting to track down another vessel in the North Sea will require assigning a crewmate to listen for contacts, using the hydrophone to triangulate a location. You’ll need to then assign another crew member to man the periscope and manually identify any vessels that come into sight, all while trying to keep a low profile. This is all done while keeping an eye on not just your fuel, but electric power, morale, and air quality too.</p>


<p>Even on its most casual difficulty setting, UBOAT throws players in at the deep end. It’s just that kind of game. Fans of hardcore simulations will revel in the game’s immersive web of overlays, dials, gauges, and menus, while newcomers may want to pare back many of these features, offloading and automating tasks such as setting daily schedules for each crew member. If you’re a total maniac (or just so happen to be a submarine boffin) you can go the opposite way, micromanaging to your heart’s content and engaging in the most authentic, most rewarding UBOAT experience.</p>
<p>The tutorials do a decent job of explaining core concepts, though it will take a long time before you feel adept at handling engagements with other ships. Launching torpedoes is where the real action is at, though these set pieces take a lot of preparation to pull off, calculating the size, range, speed, and bearing of a target before lining up a missile perfectly. Again, for those playing on harder difficulties, this process is a lot more involved, as you use rulers and protractors to work out your calculations, even whipping out a stopwatch to monitor how fast an enemy ship is moving while monitoring them via the periscope.</p>
<p>Those moments of practiced ingenuity, narrow escapes, and unexpected scenarios will form an emergent narrative as you progress through the campaign. Not only will your knowledge of the game’s systems grow over time, your crew will also advance and learn new skills as you unlock various submarine upgrades, allowing you to tackle tougher assignments.</p>

<p>Bringing such a dense simulation game to consoles wasn’t going to be the smoothest of transitions. While it’s perfectly playable using a gamepad, there is a constant sense of unwieldiness as you cycle between the various icons and menus, using a combination of button shortcuts and the on-screen mouse. This is very much a PC-first game, and although UBOAT only hit version 1.0 a year ago, the game spent half a decade in early access being tweaked and refined for players who favour keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>The visuals aren’t exactly pushing console hardware to the max, either, though it’s hard to poke too many holes in UBOAT’s presentation. The menus and UI manage to streamline a wealth of information in a way that’s easy to process, even under pressure. There’s nothing uncanny in the way crewmates look or move around the submarine, though you’ll usually be seeing them from a distance, focusing more on the carefully recreated vessels themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>FBC Firebreak, the 3v3 co-op shooter set in the Control universe, blasted onto the scene a few short months ago, and while it was relatively well-received, the team at Remedy have set out to make sure it reaches its full potential with the game’s first major new update, coming under the title Breakpoint. This massive update includes various new improvements, including new missions, additional gun mods and a host of new enemies to blast to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Breakpoint Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the update trailer, Breakpoint really does look like it takes the game up a notch, and the idiosyncratic action of Firebreak looks better than ever before. The key changes and additions that the team have made are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Playable Crisis</b>&nbsp;– Outbreak: A mission set in the Research Sector where Firebreakers face a dangerous Mold infestation, new enemies, and unique challenges.</li>
<li><b>Crisis Board</b>&nbsp;– A redesigned structure that replaces the Job Board, delivering curated missions with more dynamic and unpredictable play.</li>
<li><b>Gun Mods</b> – 27 weapon modifiers that add customisation, power, and flexibility to every loadout.</li>
<li><b>Expanded Arsenal</b>&nbsp;– Three new heavy weapons and three new grenades for added firepower and tactical depth.</li>
<li><b>New Threats –</b>&nbsp;Five additional enemies, including Mold-specific foes and new Hiss enemies with variants.</li>
<li><b>Economy &amp; Progression Overhaul</b>&nbsp;– Gear is now fully powered upon unlocking, and currencies have been streamlined for a clearer, more rewarding experience.</li>
<li><b>Improved Onboarding</b>&nbsp;– A new tutorial, orientation videos, and redesigned early-game flow make it easier for new players to join the fight.</li>
<li><b>Gameplay Improvements</b>&nbsp;– More impactful augments and devices, improved harmful condition visuals, better survivability options, and full Crisis Kit access from level one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remedy have said that they’re going to continue to expand <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> with further, completely free updates. The next major Update, codenamed “Rogue Protocol”, will arrive in late November 2025, introducing a brand-new game mode and much-requested cross-platform voice chat to strengthen teamwork. A balance and tuning update will then follow in December, before another Major Update is currently planned for March 2026, which will add new content to the game, including a new Crisis Kit.</p>
<p>Tef <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">quite liked Firebreak FBC at launch</a>, but he felt it still had a ways to go, saying, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

<p>With Breakpoint, it really feels like Remedy are addressing some of those issues, and here’s hoping that it’ll bring even more people into the Firebreak fold. As part of that, the game is 40% off on Steam from today, so if you’ve been on the fence about jumping in, now is the perfect time to.</p>
