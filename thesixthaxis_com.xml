		<p>Konami’s Motoi Okamoto, producer of the Silent Hill franchise, has said that the company hopes to release a Silent Hill game every year.</p>
<p>“Following the release of&nbsp;Silent Hill 2&nbsp;in October 2024, we were able to deliverSilent Hill f &nbsp;​​in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track,” said Okamoto (via Google Translate). “We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We’re not sure how far we can achieve this, but we’ll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we’d like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant. We’ll do our best to provide you with new updates, so we hope you’ll wait a little longer.”</p>


<p>The announced games are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/19/silent-hill-townfall-is-in-development-by-no-code/">Silent Hill Townfall,</a> which is in development at No Code, and a remake of the original Silent Hill by Bloober Team is also in the works. There’s also the new Silent Hill film that was meant to be out in 2025, but that seems rather unlikely now.&nbsp; Bloober Team announced the remake of the first Silent Hill game in June 2025 and at the time said they had been working on for three years. Quite why Konami remade <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> first is a bit odd, but they must have had their reasons.</p>
<p>It seems that Konami are going to farm out the Silent Hill IP to different development teams to create games, so they may not all be in the classic Silent Hill mould.</p>

<p>Nick loved Silent Hill f and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">gave it 10/10 in his review.</a> “Silent Hill f isn’t just a return to form, it’s a landmark entry in the series. Konami. NeoBards and Ryukishi07 have knocked it out of the park. For me, this isn’t just Game of the Year material, it’s an integral piece of Silent Hill history.”</p>

		<p>The servers for Rainbow Six Siege X have been offline for over twenty-four hours after hackers managed to get into the hardware, gifting billions of in-game currency and unbanning players.&nbsp; The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status"> official Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp; server status page</a> is rather coyly calling this an “unplanned outage”.</p>
<p>The issues began late on the 26th December when players started noticing billions of currency, known as Renown, dropping into their accounts. Ubisoft’s anti-cheat software then started suspending accounts. Others found strange messages appearing on the side of the screen, or super-rare skins in their inventory.</p>



<p>Ubisoft have shut down all servers for all platforms and have posted a couple of updates. Firstly they say that no one will be banned if they managed to spend any of the credits they received, but a rollback of accounts is in progress to remove the pirate treasure.&nbsp; They also say the ban ticker that was turned off in an old update had been reinstated, but will now be removed again, and “an official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but it is not related to this incident.”</p>
<p>“A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes,”&nbsp;posted Ubisoft on X&nbsp; “The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more.”</p>

<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>
