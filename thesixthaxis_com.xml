		<p>It seems as though lots of people have jumped on the VR train this Christmas, with a Meta Quest 3 or a PSVR 2 lurking under the festive tree, ready to help you escape from the remaining leftovers and a visit from Auntie Maureen. It’s the perfect time too, as the VR scene has seen some amazing games appear in the last twelve months, with the latest hardware allowing developers to really push experiences further than ever before. At the head of the pack has been a steady flow of games from beloved series, and our game of the year manages to capture the feel of the original games in an awe-inspiring way.</p>

<p>Being Batman in VR has felt amazing before, but where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review/">Batman Arkham VR</a> let us inhabit the hero in his guise as a detective, Arkham Shadow fully translates the experience of being a master of martial arts as well. If you’ve ever played any of Rocksteady’s Arkham games, Arkham Shadow is that, but in virtual reality. You are Batman, and from the earliest moments where you catch sight of the pointy-eared shadow of his iconic headpiece, Arkham Shadow lets you embody him in a way that’s simply never been possible before.</p>


<p>The key part here is the combat, which uses the same measured and clear approach as the other Arkham games to give you the awareness to attack and counter several enemies at the same time. It works seamlessly and feels incredibly powerful, letting you flow from punch to punch, grabbing enemies and knocking-in their heads. If you’ve ever wanted to be Batman, this is it.</p>
<p>It’s helped by the fantastic visuals, which feel absolutely in keeping with the rest of the Arkham-verse. They let you feel as though you’re truly in Gotham while you explore its dank and gloomy buildings, and even with a generous eleven-hour campaign, you won’t want it to end.</p>

<h2>Metro Awakening VR – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro Awakening</a> grabs a hold of you right from the first minute, the prologue immersing you immediately within the dark tunnels and rooms of the post-apocalyptic Moscow Metro system, wandering through a station camp that’s packed full of small details, has NPCs chattering away, and some superb lighting and graphics.</p>
<p>Vertigo Games has done a great job of adapting the main Metro series to VR, the simple acts of needing to hurriedly pull on a gas mask, change its filters, or to flip on a head lamp adding to the feeling that you really are within this world. And then there’s all the tension and fear that you feel when trying to sneak past enemies, creeping around in the dark and craning your neck to spot where they are, and the eternal fear that you’re going to run out of ammo, given the limited resources of this world.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best VR games of this year, Metro Awakening is another example of just how far VR gaming has come.</p>
<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h2>Vendetta Forever –&nbsp;Runner-up</h2>
<p>You know when the action movie hero is grabbing weapons as they run out of ammo to continue their ongoing killing spree? That’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/vendetta-forever-review/">Vendetta Forever</a>. In fact, you grab a gun out of the air, teleporting to its position to traverse the level and, most importantly, get out of the way of the hail of gunfire that’s on its way. It’s fast, a little frantic, and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It’s more than that though, Vendetta Forever plays around a lot with the premise, whether recreating the lobby scene from the Matrix, Roadhousing a bunch of people in a bar, or the amazingly cool Daredevil-style levels, where you can only see sounds. It’s a creative, fast, fun, and frankly just incredibly cool at all times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/27/snow-bros-wonderland-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Every holiday growing up, we’d head off to our caravan. I spent each day embroiled in outdoor activities like riding my bike, climbing trees and skateboarding exceptionally badly, and I loved every single second of being there. When all that fresh air wore thin, the other thing I loved was the arcade. This wasn’t a huge arcade, it was a room in the central caravan site centre, with three or four arcade machines and an air hockey table that never worked. Still, this was my haven, and my first experience of classic games like Rainbow Islands and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs. There are formative moments in your life, and this place played a huge role in my love for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Snow Bros. Wonderland - Launch Trailer - PS4 | PS5 | Nintendo Switch | Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfOEWzJbNQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Snow Bros. was a major part of that. An absolute favourite amongst those machines, it was a riff on the original Super Mario Bros. game, giving you a single-screen platform arena that saw you coating enemies in snow before booting them across the screen, taking out any enemies stupid enough to get in the way, plastering them all over the place. It was the right side of chaotic, and visually appealing, and my supply of 20 pence pieces would clink satisfyingly into the beckoning coin slot until my pockets were empty.</p>


<p>This is all to say, I was astounded and eternally happy to discover that the Snow Bros. would be returning. Snow Bros. Wonderland is a sequel to the original two games, following on from their storyline, with the children of the original Snow Bros. taking up the mantle to save the kingdom from the evil King Atchich. It shifts from the 2D perspective to an isometric 3D one, but the overarching gameplay remains the same: cover the badguys in snow, and then yeet them around the screen. As a starting point, it’s a great one.</p>


<p>The team at Tatsujin, under the watchful eye of original developers Toaplan, have captured plenty of the charm of the original, though I preferred the slightly chubbier build of the original Snow Bros. to that of their slender sons. The enemies have made the jump to 3D as well, and though it’s not as immediately arresting as the original, it’s a fine attempt. The game is broken up into different worlds, with the landscape and enemies changing as you advance, each one headed by a massive enemy boss, each of which are simple, but visually appealing.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises is the challenge that you can face in Snow Bros. Wonderland – its cheery visual style belies some tough moments, particularly against the bosses. That said, it’s just the right side of challenging, and there’s plenty of reward for seeing off the final enemy or firing the last snowball into a particularly annoying enemy.</p>
<p>You’re aiming for the highest score as possible as these are then converted into a currency you can use to upgrade your Snow Bros. abilities and their visual look. I loved being able to deck them out in cute hats and boots, and they really become yours, while the slow and somewhat puny feeling attacks they have at the start soon advance into powerful and uproarious abilities later on.</p>

<p>You’ll need them too. My favourite moments were where you have to survive against a steady stream of enemies for a set amount of time, and the game pours it on here, dropping wave after wave into your area. This, in turn, lets you ride a giant snowball through a ton of enemies, resulting in a deeply satisfying combo. You can multiply that enjoyment by playing in four-player co-op too, as there’s plenty of amusement to be had yeeting snowballs at each other on the way to clearing an area.</p>
<p>The only yellow mark in the snow is that the Nintendo Switch version of the game has a poor frame rate when docked. It’s not aggressively bad, with inconsistent dips, but you’ll notice it the moment you start playing. It’s still playable, but it makes the game feel hastily put together when that isn’t the case. Things improve greatly when you play in handheld mode, and everything becomes brighter and more vibrant here, rather than the washed-out look it has when blown up on a TV, and I happily played here for many hours through the campaign.</p>

		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO - Everything You Need To Know" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jH5hZqNirVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>
