		<p>With just a month before the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> release on 12th February for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared a gameplay deep dive to reveal a bunch of the details to the latest Mario sports game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – A courtside deep dive! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-jpcJnnllI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mario Tennis Fever is built, of course, around the core rules of Tennis with basic shots like Top Spin, Slice and Lobs, with slides and leaping shots to reach the ball… but this is a series that always brings something pretty extra. This time around it’s Fever Rackets, which can unleash all sorts of special shots and wild effects.</p>
<p>Having charged up your Fever gauge with a long enough rally, you can pull off a Fever Shot, with each of the game’s 30 rackets having a unique effect. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Racket – Freeze a patch of the court</li>
<li>Pokey Racket – Summon a Pokey</li>
<li>Shadow Racket – Summon a shadow double to play alongside you</li>
<li>Golden Dash Racket – Get a burst of speed to reach the ball</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky thing is that you can block a Fever Shot, so long as you reach and return the ball before it lands on your side of the court – Sneaky! The various Fever Shots that deal damage can also reduce your HP until you’re forced to take a time out. Oh, and in doubles, you can both unleash a Fever Shot at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s 38 characters in total, including all of the usuals and with a special shoutout for Baby Waluigi, Goomba and Nabbit. The full list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Pauline</li>
<li>Wario</li>
<li>Waluigi</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Luma</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Bowser Jr.</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Boo</li>
<li>Shy Guy</li>
<li>Koop Trooper</li>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Diddy Kong</li>
<li>Bow-Wow</li>
<li>Birdo</li>
<li>Koopa Paratroopa</li>
<li>Petey Piranha</li>
<li>Piranha</li>
<li>Boom Boom</li>
<li>Blooper</li>
<li>Dry Bowser</li>
<li>Bry Bones</li>
<li>Baby Mario</li>
<li>Baby Luigi</li>
<li>Baby Peach</li>
<li>Wriggler</li>
<li>Nabbit</li>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Baby Wario</li>
<li>Baby Waluigi</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has particular stats, but you can match them up with any racket.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of modes to play in, from a standard tournament (now with commentary), to the tricky&nbsp;Trial Towers and Mix It Up mode, where you’ll have to play minigame modes like Ring Shot, Forest Court Match, Pinball Match, Racket Factory Match, Wonder Court Match (with Super Mario Wonder effects).</p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a ton of multiplayer. Up to four players can play on a single system in split-screen, while there’s local wireless multiplayer, and support for GameShare (which also supports streaming to the original Nintendo Switch, even though this is a Switch 2 exclusive). Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever also has amiibo support, with various Mario amiibo changing the design of the ball used within play, but not actual gameplay effects.</p>

		<p>Epic is kicking off 2026 with their first major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> collab event of the year, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-park">South Park</a> has been smushed into the enduring battle royale. There’s some fun new twists here, from the 5-player Quints playlist, to the Cartmanland POI and a free Born in the Chaos battle pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Born in Chaos - South Park Drops Into Fortnite!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13QoRmIFK0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having dredged up the powerful Stick of Truth, Butters has forced Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny to play Fortnite with him. The stick is so powerful, it’s managed to bend the game code to allow all five of them to team up in the Quints playlist.</p>
<p>Here’s what else you’ll find in this event, running from today through 5th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gameplay Items:</b>&nbsp;Players can restore health, heal allies, or damage enemies with <b>Cheesy Poofs</b>; reboot automatically after being eliminated with the one-time-use <b>Kenny’s Respawn Token</b>; and for the first time ever, control where the Storm goes by retrieving the one-time-use <b>Stick of Truth</b> from the sky.</li>
<li><b>Cartmanland:</b> Drop into a new POI: Cartman’s massive personal theme park! Cartmanland features rideable thrills such as CHAOS BLAST, Voyage to the Center of the Planet, and Pi Pi’s Splash Town.</li>
<li><b>The Born in Chaos Pass:</b>&nbsp;With no V-Bucks required, the Born in Chaos Pass features 13 South Park-themed items players can unlock – including a Cheesy Poofs Emote, Back Blings, Pickaxes, and more – by completing new South Park Quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epic has always been pretty hot on the IP collabs, but it certainly feels as though they’re picking up the pace on some of these. In the last few months of 2025 along, they brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/03/the-kpop-demon-hunters-have-dropped-into-fortnite-for-some-demon-rush-pve/">K-Pop Demon Hunters</a> into the game from the hit Netflix movie, and the there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/the-fortnite-x-simpsons-crossover-has-been-a-pretty-big-hit/">the whole Simpsons crossover</a>.</p>

<p>South Park is hardly a stranger to the realms of video games, from one of the most popular and enduring episodes of the show having featured World of Warcraft at the peaks of its early popularity, to the menagerie of tie-in games from the tail end of the PS1 and N64 era, through to the popular RPG duology <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/04/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review/">Stick of Truth</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/">The Fractured But Whole</a> – it’s obviously Stick of Truth that Fortnite is leaning on to get the boys into the game.</p>

		<p>Developer Lion Shield that its Roman themed city builder Nova Roma will no longer be releasing into early access on January 22nd. Following feedback from those who have played the Nova Roma demo, the developer has made the decision to delay the game by two months to put in some extra polish. That means Nova Roma early access will now launch on March 26th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nova Roma - Demo Now Available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtHL2DE4K-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a joint statement Pete, Michael, &amp; Sam of Lion Shield said, <em>“First off, thanks for all your feedback on the Nova Roma demo! It’s been great to see the cities everyone’s creating, and we’ve definitely been impressed and surprised with the things you’re all doing with the dams and aqueducts! Given the response to the demo, we are going to push our launch date back a couple more months. The new date will be March 26th, 2026. Using your feedback we’ve updated the demo with lots of tuning, fixes, and recently we added rain, flooding, and droughts. We’ll continue to update the demo – we’re sort of thinking of it as a ‘proto-early access’. It’s disappointing to have to wait even longer and we’re sorry about that! We want to make sure everything is polished and we want to get in as much of your feedback as possible before release. Until then we hope you enjoy the demo and keep the feedback coming!”</em></p>
<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly. Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>
