		<p>Sony registers hundreds of&nbsp; patents each year, and almost none of them ever make it to market, but the latest idea is quite odd.</p>
<p>US20260021409 is described thusly “Artificial intelligence (AI) models are disclosed to generate unique, personalised podcasts of news that a particular gamer would find interesting. The podcasts can present the news in a voice of a video game character of a video game already played by the respective gamer.”</p>


<p>Or in other words, if you are playing God of War, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=kratos">Kratos</a> will make you a personalised podcast about the God of War series, or Aloy may pop up and tell you about her day hunting robotic beasties. The mind boggles as to what the Helldivers 2 podcast would sound like, probably a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>The podcast may also include video, and use data collected from your PlayStation to work out where you are in a specific game and give you some tips on how to progress.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, but certainly not one that will happen any time soon. Sony does not own the rights to the actors’ voices, and Christopher Judge isn’t going to allow his gravelly tones to be used without a big fat pay cheque. Most actors are very much against their voices being used in AI anyway; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike">2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike </a>was a response to AI concerns.</p>

<p>Previously, Sony have filed patents for a virtual controller which allows you to use any object instead of a DualSense, the patent design specifically showing a banana. An AI Emotional Modulator was patented in 2021, which would monitor your in-game chat and would automatically mute you if you got angry, and there was also a patent for a fluffy cloud-like robot that could sit beside you on the couch and analyse your emotions and offer condolences when you get beaten in a boss battle.</p>
<p>Or just have a cat. Almost the same thing.</p>
