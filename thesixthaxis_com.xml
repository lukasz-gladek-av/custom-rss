		<p>Featured as part of the Capcom Spotlight stream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has some big updates coming soon. Free Title Update 2 launches next week on 30th June, bringing back Lagiacrus and Seregios, and plenty more besides!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJQFAfT0T3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The long-awaited return of Lagiacrus brought an interesting challenge for Capcom, the Monster Hunter Tri star having introduced water battles back in the day. For this reappearance in Monster Hunter Wilds, underwater battles will return, but will be an additive to the surface combat and have some special moves, like the grapple, to help getting in close to deal damage.</p>
<p>Seregios then appeared in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, the version of the game that had an international release. As an agile monster that came with a then surprising diagonal kick and speed, these properties have been retained for the Wilds update.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Monster Hutner Wilds Title Update 2 brings new weapon layering – you just need to have crafted the final weapon in the tree, hit the final level for Artian weapons, or high ranked for Palico weapons, and this will give more customisation options.</p>

<p>Photo mode is being enhanced with the ability to hide characters, youll be able to swap Erik in for Alma as you handler, and there’s a new support unit with Mina, a sword and shield user from Vespae Unit.</p>

<p>The summer roadmap for MH Wilds is also stacked. From 23rd July there will be the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, bringing a new look to Grand Hub, and with a bunch of new rewards.</p>
<p>Arch-Tempered Uth Dura will then appear on 30th July, this limited time creature offering new armour sets for those who can overcome its HR 50+ event quest and challenge.</p>
<p>Oh, and then at the end of August? Yeah, then you can grab a Fender and start shredding. This barmy real-world collab is feeding back into the game with a limited event that rewards players with a guitar. You’ll get a rendition of the guitar which has been scanned in with photogrammetry, touched up with scuffs and scratches, and which has then been brought into the game alongside custom motion captured animations, music recorded on this actual guitar, and just a huge attention to detail. Heck, even palicos will start to jump around an air guitar when you use this emote gesture!</p>
<p>Released earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds was the long-awaited successor to Monster Hunter Worlds, arriving from the off for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">our review</a>, “Monster Hunter Wilds is the best Monster Hunter game we’ve ever had. The best storyline, the best visuals, and changes to the combat that revolutionise the way the game plays. That said, striving for the widest audience yet has dulled some of the series difficulty, and you may have to wait for the toughest parts of Wilds to fully reveal themselves.”</p>

		<p>Just a couple weeks after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/resident-evil-9-requiem-revealed-and-is-out-next-february/">Resident Evil Requiem closed out Summer Game Fest</a>, Capcom has shared another good inside look at the hotly anticipated sequel, speaking to the creators about the inspirations and direction that this new game is taking. The game is set to launch on February 27th 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZ4YPcRZL8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there’s insights on how RE Engine has evolved to cope with some of the ordeals that Grace is being put through. For example, when hung upside down, the rush of blood to her head will now add redness to her face, while a wig was used to model the hair hanging upside down and the motion that it causes.</p>
<p>For the setting and returning to Raccoon City, Art Director Tomonori Takano said, “we’ve seen a lot of characters face hardship due to Raccoon City, who have faced those hardships and grown. Figuring out how to tell a story which came off of all that came before was actually quite a daunting undertaking that I was nervous about.”</p>
<p>Nakanishi-san then said, “There were a lot of characters involved in the original outbreak who lost their lives or were changed drastically as a result of it. […] This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>
<p>Longer developer interviews are available by signing up with a Capcom ID at <a href="http://game.capcom.com/residentevil/">game.capcom.com/residentevil/&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to be another big shift in style and tone for the long-running horror franchise. Starring Grace Ashcroft, the story drags her back to Raccoon City, 30 years on from its destruction in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, as she follows the trail of strange deaths at the Renwood Hotel as an FBI technical analyst. That just so happens to be where her mother was herself murdered eight years previously.</p>
<p>The game will call back to some of the most iconic entries of the series to date by having Grace be pursued by a monster, similar to Mr. X and Lady Dimitrescu, and (as was eventually added to RE Village), you’ll be able to switch between first person and third person perspectives, which will help to shift the tone of the game and experience. to your liking.</p>
