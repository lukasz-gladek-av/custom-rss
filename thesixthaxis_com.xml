		<p>ININ Games has announced R-Type Dimensions III with the studio aiming to release the game in May 2026. The side scrolling shooter will feature completely rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning with players able to choose between 2D and 3D views of the action. ININ Games has also announced a Special Edition and Collectors Edition of the game.</p>

<p>The main features of R-Type Dimensions III includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</li>
<li>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</li>
<li>Advanced mode accessible from the start</li>
<li>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</li>
<li>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get the Special Edition it will set you back approximately £54, and that will net you the game, a special edition box, the original soundtrack and an artbook. There is also the R-Type III Dimensions Collector’s Edition, which is priced at a much higher price of nearly £180. That features an exclusive case cover and manual, the artbook, a two disc soundtrack, posters, stickers, bosscards, replica boxes, and 15cm resin statue of Dobkeratops facing off against the R-90. Oh, you will also get a numbered certificate of authenticity.</p>

<p>R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released for PC, PS5, Switch, and Switch 2.</p>
