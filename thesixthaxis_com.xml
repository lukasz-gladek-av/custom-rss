		<p>Nomada Studio and Devolver Digital have announced Neva: Prologue, a DLC expansion for the gorgeous side-scrolling adventure that will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Switch and PC on 19th February. Oh, and it’s just £2.49.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva: Prologue | Coming February 19" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SELjelhDqDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you wondered just how it was that Alba met her wolf companion Neva in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/neva-review/">the 2024 game</a>, then Neva: Prologue is set to answer that. It will start as Alba follows white butterflies into a corrupted swamp, only to find a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Alba will have to earn the wolf’s trust, fight new enemies together and overcome monsters that are stalking them.</p>
<p>While it is a prequel story, it’s designed to be played after completing the main game. It will come with three new locations, each with new gameplay mechanics, new challenges, enemies and boss encounters. Completionists will also have five hidden challenge flowers to seek out.</p>
