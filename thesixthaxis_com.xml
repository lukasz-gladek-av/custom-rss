		<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, Bandai Namco has announced. It will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was first announced in July, with confirmation that BLEACH Rebirth of Souls would contain a brand new story, instead of adapting an established plot instead. A new trailer has been released to mark the March 21st date, and it features Aizen and Yamamoto. These are two more playable characters of the game.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em>&nbsp;“The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

		<p>Gran Turismo has been a monolith of racing for PlayStation fans over the past three decades, and so to mark its importance, Sony and Polyphony Digital have put together a new free-to-play experience dubbed My First Gran Turismo.</p>
<p>My First Gran Turismo will be available for free across both PS5 and PS4 via the PlayStation Store on 6th December at midnight local time.</p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xXXU7LlrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aim with this game is to pay homage to the very first entry in the series, appreciating it through the modern game engine of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Still, it’s designed to be “approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level,” series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explains.</p>
<p>The game will include three races, three time trials and three Music Rally stages, as well as a suite of License Tests to complete. 18 cars are included, and the trio of tracks are&nbsp;Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>

<p>In a nice bonus, My First Gran Turismo also has full <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> support via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a nice homage to the franchise history, though this looks like it’s effectively just a demo for Gran Turismo 7. That’s no bad thing, of course, and having even a small slice of GT7 racing available for anyone and everyone to check out on PS4 and PS5 is pretty great in our books.</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has one of those weird and slightly unsettling announcements for gamers to contemplate: they’ve brought the release of their next game… forward? That’s right, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is now releasing one week earlier on 4th February 2025. Surprise!</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day before the debut of a new story trailer at the PC Gamer Show tomorrow, 5th December, as the game is nominated as one of most anticipated games of next year. At the same time the PC</p>


<p>There’s further good news, though. The game has now gone Gold, which used to mean that a game was all done and dusted and ready for release – these days it means that it’s ready to get something put on discs for consoles, while the devs continue to hurriedly squash bugs for a day one patch. Still, it’s a great milestone and allows Warhorse to make some further announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>One of these things is a confirmation of the PC specs and requirements, which will come tomorrow, where they will also reveal the performance that they’re able to get out of consoles. One little tidbit is that the game will have a 60fps mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and it will also be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro Enhanced</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 –&nbsp;Henry and Hans go to the big city</a></h2>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier this year, exploring the opening in the gorgeous countryside of Bohemia (with some not-so-gorgeous narrative twists for Henry and Sir Hans), before leaping ahead to the big city of Kutenberg.</p>

<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.”</p>
