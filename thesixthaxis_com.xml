		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a> is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 17th December, launching on the same day as a new Fuddler’s Courtship DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ESRB] Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley – Fuddler’s Courtship &amp; Consoles | Coming 17th of Dec!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twB2woK3HKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley launched earlier this year, a wonderful adaptation of Tove Jansson’s enduring world and characters. Instead of following the Moomins themselves, it casts you instead as the carefree wanderer Snufkin, returning&nbsp;to Moominvalley in the spring, just as the Moomins are waking up from their winter hibernation, only to find that things have changed and that her best friend, Moomintroll, has gone missing. What was once an idyllic natural area, has been cut down in places, drained out, and transformed into more orderly parks. We can’t be having that, now, can we?</p>
<p>Whether you’re coming to the game new on PS5 and Xbox, or returning to it on Switch and PC,&nbsp;Fuddler’s Courtship will add a new pocket-sized adventure to the game, shifting the season to the autumn, and with the colour palette changing to match. This is a story of romance, as Fuddler needs some help from Snufkin and Moomintroll, diverting from their planned pre-winter camping trip with a chaotically romantic new journey.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a charming game and adaptation. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review/">our review</a>, Aran said, “Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is a delightful game, which will please long time Moomin fans, and could introduce the characters to a new audience and generation. The game is wholesome, one for all ages, and addresses the issue of environmentalism in a careful and constructive way. It is definitely worth playing.”</p>
