<p>Back in April, we went hands of with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, saying, <em>“For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</em></p>
<p>You can watch our video preview too.</p>

		<p>Dangen Entertainment and developer Friends of Safety have announced that the action horror RPG Kingdom of Night will be available from December 2nd on PC. A console version is due at a later date.

<p>The story of Kingdom of Night follows John as he embarks on a mission to save the town of Miami from the forces of Baphomet who seeks to conquer. In addition to fighting Baphomet’s monsters, John also has to deal with high school bullies. John can be one of five classes, Barbarian, Knight, Rogue, Necromancer and Sorcerer, with each giving base powers and stats that can be improved upon in the skill tree. The game can also be played in local co-op, so someone else can accompany John to face the forces of evil and the high school bullies.&nbsp;Players will be able to freely explore the town of Miami, finding quests to tackle as they do so as well as secrets which could deliver some powerful gear.</p>
<p>Kingdom of Night will be available on Steam, GOG, Humble Store, and itch.io, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695580/Kingdom_of_Night_Demo/">with a demo currently available on Steam.</a></p>
