		<p>Last week, Team Peak teased <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/peak-is-getting-a-new-biome-next-week/">the new Roots biome,&nbsp;</a>announcing it would be released on November 5th. Well, today is November 5th and Team Peak has released the Roots update which takes players to a redwood forest filled with forests and creepy crawlies. Roots will replace the Tropics up to November 17th and after that the maps will rotate between the two biomes. New tools including the Rescue Claw and the Checkpoint Flag have been added to help players, along with more badges and cosmetics.</p>
