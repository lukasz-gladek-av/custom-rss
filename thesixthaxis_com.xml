		<p>Gearbox and Sony have announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> gameplay deep dive State of Play will stream tomorrow, 30th April, through the official PlayStation Twitch and YouTube channels.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to tune in from 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST to see over 20 minutes of developer-led gameplay to show what’s new, old and a bit different about this latest game in the hit looter shooter series.</p>


<p>In a further surprise, Borderlands 4’s release date is now set for 12th September across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC – this is actually earlier than was announced in February’s State of Play by two weeks. Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox is now owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>, and Take-Two’s constantly said that GTA 6 will launch in late 2025, perhaps there’s a bit of insider knowledge as the company looks to make as much money as possible?</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s showcase will be hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson. This will see the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos and take down the Timekeeper, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>
