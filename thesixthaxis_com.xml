		<p>Nintendo have announced that the price of the original Switch consoles and accessories will be changing this weekend in the United States. While they do not explicitly state that the price is going to increase, if the price was to be reduced they would be shouting about it, so it’s easy to read between the lines and this is a price hike.</p>
<p>Here’s the text from Nintendo.</p>


<p><em>“Pricing for the original Nintendo Switch™ family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.”</em></p>
<p>I have been writing video games news for a very long and I think this is the first time a legacy console has had a price increase, rather than a decrease. Some US retailers have already changed their prices, adding $40-$50 to the price of a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>As for why the prices are being increased, it’s fairly obvious. The consoles are made outside the US and that means <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cpqvdxzwv22t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tarrifs.</a></p>
<p>The price increase may have little impact as everyone seems to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-huge-new-console-sales-record-in-its-first-month/">buying a Switch 2.&nbsp;</a>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process – they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles,</p>
