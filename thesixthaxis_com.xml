		<p>Kojima is teaming up with Niantic to create a new… thing. It’s not a game, but will “l<span lang="EN-US">everage Niantic Spatial’s geospatial AI technology to bring Hideo Kojima’s iconic storytelling into the real world. </span>”</p>
<p>The video makes it look like some sort of AR app that might expand on the mechanism in Death Stranding that allowed you to leave markers and notes for other players. That’s just a guess but we do know NSAND is not linked to Niantic’s other big game,<a href="https://ingress.com/en"> Ingress.</a></p>

<p>“The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what’s possible in interactive storytelling. For KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS, it’s a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world,” say Kojima Productions.</p>

<p>“At Niantic Spatial, we’re building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction,” said John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Spatial. “We are delighted to be working with KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans.”</p>
