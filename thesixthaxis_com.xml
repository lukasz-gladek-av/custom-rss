		<p>One of the many small facts that has been picked up on since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct last week is that a physical <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> of an upgraded game for the new console won’t necessarily have a Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge inside the box.</p>
<p>While this decision will be down to the publisher, Nintendo’s chosen the route that a physical copy of Breath of the Wild: Switch 2 Edition or the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> with have a Nintendo Switch 1 cartridge and a download code for the Switch 2 Edition upgrade.</p>


<p>This has been confirmed by dummy packshot imagery distributed by Nintendo:</p>

		
		


<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1js9s09/nintendo_support_says_that_switch_2_enhanced/">This decision has been widely decried by gamers</a> that still champion physical media and the second hand market. Many have noted the similarity to online passes that were common in the early 2010s, which were partly designed to as a way to extract a toll from second hand game sales. This will have a similar effect, so that a second hand copy of a Switch 2 Edition game will need the buyer to separately purchase the Switch 2 Edition upgrade… at which point, you might as well see if a standard Switch version of a game is available for a lower price.</p>

<p>By contrast, it’s been confirmed that Rune Factory’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will be a Switch 2 specific card:</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>
<p>The one upside of Nintendo’s approach is that a physical Switch 2 Edition will be usable with both generations of console, but it is a shame that Nintendo hasn’t produced a cross-gen cartridge as well – in fairness, games might have textures and game data re-encoded for Switch 2, and so balloon the size of a combined game install.</p>
<p>However, this is in contrast to the cross-gen strategies of Xbox and PlayStation. Sony’s PS5-upgraded remasters have then had PS5-specific discs printed for the purpose, while Microsoft pushed hard with cross-gen Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One discs in many instances (though typically also requiring large game updates and downloads to actually install a game).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it’s been confirmed that Switch 2 game cards won’t necessarily have a copy of the game on the card itself. These <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Game-Key-Cards-2785635.html">Game-Key Cards will be labelled on the box</a>, and act as a physical license key to let you download a game to the internal storage. This honestly isn’t an uncommon sight to see with modern games on other platforms, where there’s been games like Halo Infinite where the disc is effectively just a license key. This is potentially preferable to the ‘Code in Box’ physical releases for Nintendo Switch, which include an eShop key to download, as there will still be trade-in value for the game.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is a reminder of the impermanence of digital games, and there’s always the potential risk in years and decades to come that access is removed one way or another.</p>

		<p>The recently revealed sci-fi FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> now has a launch date, and it’s really soon! La Quimera is coming out for PC via Steam on 25th April, and there’s a closed beta test set to take place this weekend on 12th April.</p>
<p>Here’s a fresh gameplay trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Reburn – the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, which is best known for its work on the Metro franchise, but has rebranded for this new original IP – La Quimera is a narrative-led FPS set in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis of Nuevo Caracas&nbsp;and a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren. The game casts&nbsp;you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>Playable solo or with three-player co-op, you’ll be able to coordinate combat tactics and complimentary skills, while your exosuit gives you &nbsp;things like a multitarget electric shock, scanning for hidden enemies, dodging and more.</p>

<p>Reburn as a studio naturally carries forward a lot of talent from the Metro series. The project lead is Oleksandr Kostiuk, who was Metro 2033, Last Light, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Exodus</a> gameplay and AI designer, but throughout the team, there’s experience that even goes back to before 4A’s founding by ex-STALKER developers. The company is newly rebranded in an effort to distinguish itself from 4A Games Cyprus – it’s this half of the brand and this studio that is owned by Plaion, and which is presumably continuing on with the Metro franchise.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said, “As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: Creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn’t be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we’re profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience. We’re also truly thankful to everyone who supported and believed in us along the way.”</p>
