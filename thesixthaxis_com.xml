		<p>KING Art and Deep Silver have announced that a second closed alpha playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will be taking place next week, with the confirmed dates being December 12th to December 15th. Those who took part in the November closed playtest will automatically be enrolled and emails will be sent on how to join. Those who did not take part in the Novmber closed playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV need to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/gb/games/dawn-of-war-iv#newsletter">Dawn of War IV newsletter</a> as information on how to take part will be sent through that.</p>

<p>In a statement the developers said, <em>“While this next round of testing will remain relatively small in size, we’re looking to bring on some new testers alongside our existing group of Closed Alpha Testers to provide feedback on the game as we work to shape the future of Dawn of War IV together. <wbr>As a reminder, these tests utilize an early Alpha Build of the game, with selected testers being required to sign an NDA, as well as agree not to share, discuss, screenshot, or record any part of the test. Additionally, if you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create a free Discord account if selected.”</em></p>
<p>Only a select few new closed alpha playtesters will be selected for this round of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV playtest, as it will remain small in scale. Future playtests will expand the content available and allow more players to join. When it releases, the game will have over 70 campaign missions which can be played solo or in co-op, and the four factions will include the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Tribute Games has released the first big patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, with the main focus by the team being removing bugs from the game. Some of the fixes in this patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion include addressing an issue causing the game to crash when joining multiplayer sessions, an issue where Super Heroes stats would not upgrade, and also making sure Master Mold is no longer invulnerable. You can read the full list of fixes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p><b>Fixes!</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heteropteron Blocker&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where having camera shake effects OFF would stop the cinematic from triggering, keeping Super Heroes trapped in Stage 13<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Crashing</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where joining a multi-player game session and resetting story progress would trigger a crash<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Cheating!&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where Master Mold would become invulnerable and non-targetable, which if anything was just rude<wbr></li>
<li><b>Venom Issues</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed issues where Venom could become frozen after being parried during Symbiote Pounce or immediately lose armor during Venom Bite<wbr></li>
<li><b>Upgrade Blocking&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue that would mean Super Heroes’ stats did not upgrade after levelling up unless players returned to the main menu.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Superpowers</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where enemies would deal abnormally high damage on their first hit during a grab<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Invulnerability&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue (and related issues) where Annihilus wouldn’t re-enter the staggered/vulnerable state and players couldn’t deal damage<wbr></li>
<li><b>Where’s Hela?!&nbsp;</b>– Fixed an issue where Hela could de-synchronise while teleporting<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Forever!&nbsp;</b>– We fixed an issue where Annihilus wouldn’t stop attacking after his shield breaks<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Connections</b>&nbsp;– Fixed an issue which could cause problems when the host disconnects while Super Heroes are joining a lobby (this should now simply return you to the multiplayer menu)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reigning in She-Hulk</b>&nbsp;– Option now added to have controller shake only for players controlling the character (meaning that She-Hulk’s controller vibration only happens for the player controlling her)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Hold On What?!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where Super Heroes would sometimes be swapped when respawning<wbr></li>
<li><b>At Least Credit Me&nbsp;</b>– The character who threw the enemy will now be considered the instigator when determining who gets credit for knocking down an assembly line bomb<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Stability</b>&nbsp;– We’ve deployed some additional protection for lobby stability when players reach Game Over in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Interrogating the Vampire</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue which prevented Super Heroes from using the Vampire modifier in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Choose your character!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed the issue with the characters’ order in character select for Steam Deck and Linux. That should fix the online desync/crashs between Steam Deck and other versions<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Smaller Fixes</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where intro music was used instead of main stage music where players joined later in Stage 2 (Genosha)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed MODOK’s movement and behaviours (quite a lot of fixes here, actually)<wbr></li>
<li>Tweaked Beta Ray Bill’s no-hammer attack to ensure it doesn’t register as a multi attack<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some enemies would do multiple hits instead of the expected one hit attack<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where enemies would walk without actually moving<wbr></li>
<li>Tweaked visuals to stop the OK / Back popup appearing while fading out.<wbr></li>
<li>Negative Blast now automatically faces the center of the screen<wbr></li>
<li>Worm enemies will now animate properly when turning to face their enemies<wbr></li>
<li>The Mission Select timer should now count down correctly in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed an issue where players could immediately spawn in a pit when joining a mid-session lobby<wbr></li>
<li>Cancelling character selection will not reset the selected skin<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed visual glitching during tally and post-boss cutscenes<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed Super Heroes appearing multiple times when confronting Annihilus<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Annihilus would play an incorrect animation following the Negative Wave attack<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where egg spawners would not always appear in the correct state<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Bug Barricade dealt multiple attacks and a huge amount of damage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed online synchronisation issues related to Sentry Laser and Statue<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed small graphical shadow errors<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a challenge completion issue related to multi-hit tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/01/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Marvel Cosmic Invasion review, Ade said,<em> “Having found Tribute Games’ previous release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, to be one of the best scrolling beat ‘em ups I’d ever played, I had high expectations for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. How could Shredder’s Revenge with Marvel characters go wrong? Sadly, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is entirely OK but fails to be anything more than that.”</em></p>
