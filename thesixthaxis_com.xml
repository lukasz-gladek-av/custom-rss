		<p>Big Bad Wolf and Nacon have announced Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, an investigation adventure that’s inspired, as with everything cosmic tentacle horror, by the Lovecraft universe. The game is coming out in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwtLXbt5n04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This first person psychological thriller will cast players as Noah, an agent of Interpol’s secret occult investigation department, Ancile. The case he’s got to investigate is all about the miners who have been disappearing in the deepest depths of the Pacific ocean, an investigation that will take him down to the ancient sunken city of R’lyeh where Cthulhu has been imprisoned.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go alone, though, with an AI companion called Key embedded in his eyes, presumably able to help with solving puzzles, but you will have to make choices that shape the story’s direction, trying to resist the power of Cthulhu along the way. That, going by the trailer, seems like a pretty tricky task, as it shows Noah struggling with visions, haunted by past events that saw him lose three digits from his right hand, and getting sucked under the surface to come up against big ol’ tentacle face.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/13/the-council-episode-one-the-mad-ones-review/">The Council</a> and Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, narrative games that had a similar investigative angle, though The Cosmic Abyss will be shifting to that first person view.</p>

<p>For our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-review/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong review</a>, Steve said, “Swansong is a good investigative adventure dressed up in vampire finery, but doesn’t quite live up to my expectations due to some overly restrictive design and a disconnect between the third person perspective and the largely text and table top mechanics. Once some of the bugs are patched and there are resources available to support the build choices you make, there is a solid adventure to be found here. It’s not the new Bloodlines, but it’s an authentic Vampire: The Masquerade experience nonetheless.”</p>
