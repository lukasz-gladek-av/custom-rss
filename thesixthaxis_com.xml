			<p>The core concept of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is utterly bonkers. You and your opponents leap from a plane, circling hundreds of miles above the ground. None of you have parachutes though, and instead you willingly freefall to your doom. As you plummet, you must shoot your fellow plummeters with your magic finger gun – yes, really. Your objective is to kill them all before you hit the ground. Oh, and your player character is called Smoke Wallace. He has purple skin and magical powers because he was bitten by the same radioactive dragon that ate all of his family. You see? Bonkers.</p>

<p>Bright and garish, the visuals are all acid-soaked kaleidoscopic weirdness. It’s not my kind of thing, but this game certainly has a striking and attention-grabbing look. Gameplay is structured around small levels that last for sixty seconds, Dropshot is gaming for the TikTok generation. Each level is intended as a dopamine hit but to be quickly forgotten. As you fall from a first-person perspective, you’ll need to dodge floating islands, laser traps and your opponents’ return fire to stay alive, and with only two lives, this can be challenging. Kill efficiently and stylishly and you’ll rack up points and a high grade, the idea being to return to each level numerous times to hit a high score and achieve a perfect run. The problem is, that despite the bonkers premise and over the top visuals, the gameplay itself is rather pedestrian, leaving me with little interest in returning to a level once it was done.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is speed; there’s little sense of any. As you hurtle through the sky, it should be an adrenaline rush, like knee-sliding in Platinum Games’ Vanquish, or hurtling round a tight corner far too fast in F-Zero. Instead, it’s more akin to strolling to the shops to buy some bread. This is an oddly muted experience, rather than dodging floating islands and traps by the skin of your teeth, you seem to have a veritable age to gently steer yourself out of the way.</p>

<p>Achieving a high score amounts to little more than the eye-straining task of having to spot your tiny freefalling opponents in the distance, slowly line up a shot, and take them out. You’ll likely fail to spot them all on the first attempt, forcing you to attempt the level numerous times to catch them. Often your foes will kill you first, but you’ll have little idea that a bullet is coming. One moment you’re alive, the next you’re dead, with little to no visual clues that an attack is incoming. Worse, the collision detection isn’t great – possibly due to the challenges of basing the game around a first-person view – meaning sometimes you die, sometimes you survive, and you’re really not sure why.</p>
<p>There are two other game modes. The first is a boss battle that sees you fighting an enormous dragon, a nasty fella who can absorb a whole lot of damage, forcing you to conserve your ammo and keep a look out for ammunition drops to fall through. This is certainly more enjoyable than the main game. Primarily because it resolves the issue of the irritating unseen enemy attacks, as the dragon blasts you with big obvious fireballs that must be quickly shot from the sky, bringing some old-school light gun game shenanigans to proceedings.</p>

<p>The final mode is a straight up race between you and your rival to catch a golden egg before you hit the ground. This does, finally, get the pulse racing, as due to numerous speed boosters things end up fast and frantic. Darting through arrays of laser beams, narrowly avoiding chunks of rock, finally I can see what the development team were going for. If these thrills and spills could be replicated throughout the rest of the game, then Aerial Knight’s Dropshot would be an absolute indie banger. As it is, there’s just too many of the boring levels getting in the way of the good stuff.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Just like with its bizarre setting and over-the-top visuals, the overall experience of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is uneven. There’s complete brilliance in places, such as the thrilling races, but they come alongside some rather uninspired and borderline frustrating combat. If I could just have a game full of the rival chases, and get rid of the fighting, this would be terrific. As it is, it’s alright.	</p></div>
