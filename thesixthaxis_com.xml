		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> will be getting full cross-platform multiplayer and progression, a big new photo mode and a new subclass for all 12 character classes in the game – including a Drunken Master Monk! All of this will be arriving with Patch 8 sometime in 2025, though Larian will open the floodgates for a stress testing phase before then to try and iron out as many issues as possible.</p>
<p>Stress testing Patch 8 will hopefully begin in early January, with more details to come in their next Community Update post and a sign-up process. This will hopefully avoid rapid hot fixes after the update’s release.</p>


<p>We’re a few months on from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4593196713074709213">the last patch for Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and while Larian said at the time that they would move away from big feature updates to their smash hit RPG, there were still a good few things left on their to-do list. Cross-platform multiplayer and photo mode were stated at the time, but new subclasses are a real surprise.</p>
<p>Cross-platform multiplayer – AKA cross-play – will allow all players across PS5, PC, Mac and Xbox to party up using the Larian Network that was established for Divinity: Original Sin 2. The bonus to this is that it will also introduce full cross-platform progression as well, so you can bounce back and forth between console and computer. Lovely!</p>
<p>Then there’s a proper Photo Mode coming in Patch 8 that will basically let you do whatever the heck you want. You can toggle this from the HUD by the minimap or with F9 on PC, or by clicking in both sticks on a controller, at which point you can then set the stage with character positioning, funny poses, switch up your party, and even include summons and Wild Shapes.</p>

<p>Photo Mode will have lens settings for FoV, exposure, depth of field and focus; scene settings to toggle characters on and off, so you can remove NPCs, and to select from 40 static and animated poses, each with variations and facial expressions; post-processing for colour-grading, contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignette; frames to decorate the shot; stickers with over 300 available including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects and items, and cat ears.</p>

<p>And then there’s 12 new character subclasses, which Larian describe as follows:</p>
<h3>Bard – College of Glamour</h3>
<p>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast Mantle of Inspiration to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves Charmed. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with Mantle of Majesty. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p>
<h3>Barbarian – Path of Giants</h3>
<p>Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the Giant’s Rage passive that grants both strength and size – allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p>
<h3>Cleric – Death Domain</h3>
<p>As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves – from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes Toll The Dead, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom – a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p>
<h3>Druid – Circle of Stars</h3>
<p>These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three Starry Forms for their power – the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy – the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p>
<h3>Paladin – Oath of the Crown</h3>
<p>You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you’ll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with Righteous Clarity, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with Divine Allegiance, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p>
<h3>Fighter – Arcane Archer</h3>
<p>Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p>
<h3>Monk – Drunken Master</h3>
<p>Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using Intoxicating Strike, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters’ other abilities, like Sobering Realisation – which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p>
<h3>Ranger – Swarmkeeper</h3>
<p>The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The Cloud of Jellyfish deals extra lightning damage – potentially shocking your enemy. The Flurry of Moths deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The Legion of Bees deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p>
<h3>Rogue – Swashbuckler</h3>
<p>This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to Blind them. Flick your weapon at a target to Disarm them. Or use your new Fancy Footwork passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>
<h3>Sorcerer – Shadow Magic</h3>
<p>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer Superior Darkvision, as well as the ability to Shadow Walk between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed Hound of Ill Omen to harass your foes, and use Strength of the Grave to prevent you from being downed – ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p>
<h3>Warlock – Hexblade</h3>
<p>Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p>
<h3>Wizard – Bladesinging</h3>
<p>The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p>
