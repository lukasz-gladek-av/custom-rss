		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>

		<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is a getting a free trial weekend on PS5, with players able to sample all of the game from December 27th to December 31st. There are plans for an Xbox Series X|S and PC free trial, but that will not be this weekend and a date is yet to be confirmed. To take part on PS5, all you will have to do is download <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown trial version</a> off the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Season 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L58fbjTNOT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s free trial weekend includes access to the season 2 features, adding Ibiza as another location to drive around in, as well as Hong Kong. Though to get to Ibiza, players will need to reach level 12, as well as side with either the Sharps or the Streets clans. Ibiza also adds new cars, alongside the roster of cars available in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown released in September, and met with middling reviews due to a number of issues. Since then, KT Racing has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/">sought to fix the issues</a> that players had concerns about, including the suspension on cars, AI behaviours, and more support for various racing wheels. In our review of the game, Stefan said, <em>“After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</em></p>
