		<p>Team, Jade, the developers of Delta Force and Call of Duty mobile, have revealed their next game, which is currently languishing under the name of Project Spectrum.</p>
<p>It’s a team based PvEvP shooter with a strong horror element with the trailer showing a post-mission debrief before flashbacks show what happened.. or at least, what may have happened as everything in the world is&nbsp; has been touched by the radiant, reality-warping force known only as the Ember.</p>


<p>“Everything it touches — cities, landscapes, even life itself — is transformed in unknowable ways, leaving behind dangerous regions called Ember Zones,” say Team Jade.</p>
<p>Players take the role of an Operator, leading&nbsp; missions into Ember Zones and recruiting and managing a customizable squad of elite Agents. You then take these agents in to Ember Zones and fight through enemies and other players to gather more information on what is happening.</p>

<p>“We are incredibly excited to show Project Spectrum to players worldwide, as we have been working in secret for two years,” says Basil Wang, Game Director of Project Spectrum. “With this game, we wanted to create something truly unique: a meticulously crafted and uniquely styled shooter at its core, while presenting a dangerous yet captivating world — one where players embark on an unpredictable survival adventure. As they explore, they’ll encounter unexpected threats and may even become the danger themselves. Our journey has just begun, and we can’t wait to share more in the future.”</p>

		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that the co-op Legends mode will be coming to Ghost of Yotei in 2026. If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participating in Raids, and playing as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format, and may use a mix of elements from the story including the Yotei Six.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A new story trailer has also been released which gives us more of a look at Atsu and her quest for vengeance as well as the world in which players will travel. We see wide open fields which capture a similar feel to the fields that were in Ghost of Tsushima. There are some cinematics too which show confrontations with some of the Yotei Six too.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> now has a firm release date confirmed, with the long-in-development action RPG set to launch on 21st October 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer from Gamescom Opening Night Live:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrAVDT7maJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will come with a $59.99/£49.99/€59.99 price point for the standard edition, while a Deluxe and Premium edition bumps that up to $69.99/£58.50/€69.99 and $89.99/£74.99/€89.99 respectively. What bonuses do you get? Well, the Deluxe Edition adds a Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack inspired by the original game, while the Premium Edition then also adds the Shadows and Silk DLC, which bring the Lasombra and Toreador clans into the game as playable vampire types.</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has had a very, very long journey through development. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game. Still set in Seattle, there’s a three-way power struggle for power in the Vampire Court, and in an intriguing shift, with protagonist Phyre cast as an Elder Vampire, capable of tapping into all the fantastical enhancements that each clan offers them. First expected for late 2024, release has slipped multiple times, though the most recent delay to October 2025 has finally stuck. Hurrah!</p>
<p>We’ve actually been hands on with the opening couple hours of the game in the run up to Gamescom, and there’s an intriguing blend of characters, dire situations and powerful vampire types. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">Check out our preview here</a>.</p>
