		<p>I’ve been starting 2025 with a bout of flu – thanks, 2025 – but on the plus side that’s meant I’ve been tucked up in bed with my ROG Ally, Balatro, and the end of Metaphor ReFantazio. These are all good things. Other than that, I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> (Microsoft’s cloud streaming for this is impeccable), some Kingdom Come: Deliverance to see what it’s all about, and a tiny bit of Marvel Rivals too. Life could be worse, in other words.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? <strong>Aran</strong> played Space Marine, the first one, as it’s been in his backlog forever. He told us, “It’s a nice throwback to the PS3 and 360 era of third-person shooters with obvious heavy influence from Gears of War. I was also surprised to see that the online was still quite active. I’ve also been playing more Witcher 3 and have just landed on Skellige.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been hopelessly glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> which he says is easily the best game in the series to date. Giving us some detail, he said, “After the mess that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">DW9</a> I honestly didn’t have much hope for the series, but somehow Omega Force has managed the impossible. Although there was a cathartic joy in mindlessly hammering out button combos, Origins offers a genuine test of skill and a wealth of content I’m actually eager to explore and replay. Hopefully its glowing critical reception will translate into commercial success, cementing a sequel, and an “Origins” style shake-up for Samurai Warriors.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the System Shock remake, which he says “could have done with a bit more remaking, I get it’s a classic game but it just feels so dated.” He hasn’t really enjoyed much gaming this week, to be honest, saying, “I also played The Stanley Parable and I am going to be a grumpy old man and say I didn’t think much of it at all, the narrator started getting on my tits mansplaining everything. I also played Suicide Squad (spot the theme here?) which I didn’t get past the Shark guy tutorial because it was so fricking dull, it felt like someone had tried to make Destiny by committee. I also played the new Destiny 2 episode which wasn’t particularly great either. I do have LEGO Horizon sat on my table so I’m hoping that will save the week.” Let us know if it’s saved the day TC!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for review next month, Cuisineer also for review, and a bit of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer for not review. That’s not all, but much like TC, the further gaming hasn’t been all that enjoyable – “I’ve also been playing Veilguard, which is about fifteen layers of disappointment. It feels shallow, dialogue is poor, a main character’s voice can’t pull off the role, I can’t explore during actual missions without hitting twenty dead ends I have to come back to later. The only thing it almost excels at is graphics, but even then the generic aesthetic where even Qunari don’t look particularly alien anymore is just shite.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has only been playing Marvel Rivals, hammering away at the season pass and getting reasonably good with Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon. He says, “I’m loving the new additions to the game with Season 1 and looking forward to seeing what the second half of the season brings.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through the first Gears of War on Series S (360 rather than remaster) as he fancied actually playing the series through (previously only played the remaster of 1 on PC). What did he think? “It was fun but hasn’t aged that well. Started the second one now which feels like a pretty big leap forwards. I’ve reinstalled Another Crab’s Treasure after getting distracted and completely forgetting what I was doing in it and it is still one of the best Souls-likes out there. Not resorted to using the gun yet but leaving it open as an option if I get super stuck. Picked up Blade Chimera on Steam (cheaper if you already own Bloodstained) as that’s been on my radar for a long while.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>. He dabbled with a little bit of the original Space Marine, similar to Aran dragging it out of his backlog, stomped through the opening level of RoboCop: Rogue City (which he previously played for preview), and played something secret and shadowy that he’ll talk about next week. He’s also just about to start playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> and a roguelike Tetris kind of thing called Drop Duchy.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>Sony has cancelled two more unannounced games that were part of its broad push toward live services, potentially putting jobs at risk at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games, it’s reported.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, who broke the story overnight, saying that the two games were cancelled “following a recent review”, but also stating that neither studio will be shut down as a consequence of this.</p>


<p>“Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>As unannounced projects, we don’t know for sure what either team was working on, though <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/15/seasons-greetings-2022-playstation-blog-and-friends/">Bluepoint teased something God of War related</a> in Christmas well-wishes from 2022. Bend Studio</p>
<p>There’s obviously the potential for job losses as a consequence of this, and it’s not clear if these were the only projects that either studio was working on, but in an internal memo that Bloomberg has seen, Sony said that it’s “working closely with Bend and Bluepoint to determine what are the next projects and plan to do everything we can to ensure there is minimal business impact.”</p>

<p>It’s the latest embarrassing fumble from Sony in what will go down as one of the worst games industry pivots in recent memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/02/ps5-10-live-service-games-march-2026-last-of-us-guerrilla-bungie-london-studio/">Announced in 2022 to investors</a>, Sony had plans to launch 12 live service games by 2026, and while there have been some success stories, like last year’s breakout hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or the bankable popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a> (which can be considered a live service game here), there’s been far more ignominious failures.</p>
<p>The biggest flop by far was obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> last year, which made it to release but was almost immediately pulled and shut down, with Firewalk Studios shut down a couple months later. That followed the closure of London Studios, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/28/london-studio-is-making-a-fantasy-online-co-op-game-for-ps5/">reportedly working on a fantasy online co-op game</a>, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">canning their The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, Firesprite’s Twisted Metal live service game being <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762503092593999913?s=46">canned while in pre-production</a>, shutting down <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/09/deviation-games-has-shut-down/">Deviation Games</a>, and seeing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">major struggles for Bungie</a> as they try to broaden their scope from the end of Destiny 2’s main narrative to releasing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Some live service projects are still underway, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/haven-studios-fairgame-playstation-exlcusive/">Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s studio Haven</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Horizon MMORPG</a>, an unknown live service game from Jason Blundell (who was previously at Deviation), and a game called Gummy Bears, which was spun out from Bungie last August.</p>
<p>Games are cancelled and pivoted all the time, but having announced their plans for so many live service games and an intention to latch onto the consistent revenue streams that they can provide, this has become a consistent failure point from Sony. We’re glad that there’s no layoffs right now, but unless Bend Studio (whose last game was 2019’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/days-gone-review/">Days Gone</a>) and Bluepoint Games (whose last game was the 2020 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/demons-souls-review-ps5/">Demon’s Souls</a> remake) can be pushed onto other projects, job losses and studio closures could follow.</p>
