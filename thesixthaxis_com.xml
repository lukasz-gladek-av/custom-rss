		<p>Having lived through endless years of terrible movie versions of video games it is rather nice to sit here and write nice things about such a thing, and that thing today is the movie version of Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn/">Until Dawn</a> game.</p>
<p>The trailer confirms what we learned from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/the-until-dawn-movie-teaser-explains-how-the-branching-narrative-will-be-used/">teaser,</a> in that the group of teens are trapped in a house with time resetting after they are killed, a novel way of allowing the film to explore the branching narrative found in the game. From then on we get hints of some of the grisly deaths that will occur, many of which seem to be taken from the game. We also get to see the Wendigo and Clown killer, also from the game, along with some new evil creatures including a witch and giant.</p>

<p>That looks like the perfect Friday night popcorn movie</p>
<p>Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game, but here he seems to be working at a gas station rather than playing he role of Dr. Alan J. Hill, “The Analyst”, the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice. The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<p>This year will also see the release of the odd looking Minecraft movie in April, a sequel to 2021’s Mortal Kombat film in October, and another sequel, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in December.</p>
<p>Return to Silent Hill finished shooting in February 2024 but does not have a release date yet,&nbsp; that really should show up this year unless the studio are messing about with it. The Watch Dogs movie also finished filming in the middle of last year so that may show up as well, it currently has no release date.</p>
