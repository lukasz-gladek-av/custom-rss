		<p>The release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on PS5 has seemingly been leaked by the very reliable Bilibil-kun, who claims that the acclaimed Indy game will launch on Sony’s console on 17th April.</p>
<p>Writing on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun is best known for their string of accurate leaks and reveals of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games, but has since made plenty more accurate predictions for pretty much anything video game related.</p>


<p>Per their “recent investigations”, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April, though a Premium version will feature two days early access from 15th April, in addition to a Temple of Doom outfit, digital art book and an upcoming The Order of Giants DLC. Both Standard and Premium editions will be available as a physical release, matching the Xbox pricing at £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 for the Standard edition and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium edition, with pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft proudly proclaimed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/indiana-jones-hits-4-million-players-but-xbox-revenue-and-hardware-sales-fall/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has brought in over 4 million players</a> across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this was an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>It will also be fascinating to see how the game is catering to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hardware, which will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox Series X. Full path tracing is likely off the table even with this spec bump – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">though it is supported on PC</a> – but with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>, Playground Games is able to feature ray-traced car reflections during races and free roam, which was not possible on Series X. Some kind of visual uplift could certainly be on the cards for Indy.</p>

<p>Either way, this game should be on many a PS5-owner’s wish list. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>
