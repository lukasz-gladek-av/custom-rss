		<p>It’s the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and it’s set to be one of the hottest in the UK as well. So I hope you’ve all got plans for both staying out late and for staying cool while doing so. Don’t forget your sunscreen! Unless, of course, you’re intent on bathing in the cool blue glow of computer and TV screens this weekend. Maybe you’re putting the 24Hr Nürburgring on the telly and just letting the weekend wash over you?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> has approached the end of Act1 in Tainted Grail, which has been a 9/10 experience for him so far, as he’s luckily been unaffected by a strange VFX issue that the devs are working to try to resolve. May it remain that way!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>
