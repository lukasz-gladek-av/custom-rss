		<p>Star Wars Outlaws is a cosy game? I’m sure you may be sat there thinking what are you talking about? After all Star Wars Outlaws follows Kay Vess, Nix, and ND-5 as they complete contracts for criminal syndicates while also working towards pulling off a major heist. Not to mention the masses of gun and space battles against the criminal syndicates, pirates, and the Empire. That all sounds as far from cosy as you can get, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Yet I will stand by my position that Star Wars Outlaws is also a cosy game at its heart. The term cosy game will probably bring images to mind of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, where you can live the life of a farmer or spend time decorating your home and just hanging out with friends without a care in the world. Star Wars Outlaws doesn’t let you become a moisture farmer on Tatooine or set up a small shop on Toshara, but it does provide other ways to be cosy.</p>


<p>First and foremost is treasure hunting. Getting on Kay’s speeder and just striking out into the worlds to explore places that are off the beaten path to discover new secrets is one of the best things to do in Star Wars Outlaws. Sure, some treasure is guarded and will require sneaking around or getting into a firefight, but there are many more caches that just require a bit of tracking, climbing, and puzzle solving to get the goods. It is these moments when it is just Kay and Nix working together to find treasure which epitomise cosiness to me. There is no stress, you can take your time searching for the treasure, and there is no pressure to get it done. Sure, there is a bigger job out there to complete, yet these times are islands of calm. Couple that with jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva and you just get this sense of blissful freedom.</p>


<p>The second cost corner of Star Wars Outlaws is with its galaxy of food. Cooking and enjoying food is one of my favourite things to do, so having specific street foods to try on each planet feels like another cosy thing to do to. Walking up to a food stall, getting the food, and even playing the minigame as Kay and Nix indulge in the meal. Those moments between the two capture how joyful eating a good meal can be, and the companionship it can provide. This part of Star Wars Outlaws has clearly been designed around cosiness while rewarding that cosy moment with rewards. It is the best of both wrapped in warmth.</p>
<p>Third is jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva where you just get this sense of calm and freedom. The same applies to flying through space on the Trailblazer, again treasure hunting. Yes, you can get waylaid by pirates or bandits now and again while riding or flying about, but when that isn’t happening and you are just moving with no real destination in mind also has an element of cosiness to it.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws may not be a typical cosy game, but I am coming up to 50 hours in the game and I have found it to be one of best ways to relax after a busy day. I certainly have some complaints about other parts of the experience, but they don’t all detract from those moments of calm and cosiness that Star Wars Outlaws can offer.</p>

			<p>Corsair has consistently put out my favorite gaming keyboards for the last several years. From the full-sized K70 to the compact powerhouse K65, whenever I need a new keyboard the answer has always been Corsair. Even while I was comfortable with what they already had on offer, though, the team at Corsair has continued to revolutionise and energise their line of competitive keyboard gear. The Vanguard Pro 96 packs in so many new features and upgrades I hadn’t ever considered needing in a keyboard, but now that I have them, I don’t see myself ever going with anything else.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the CORSAIR VANGUARD Series" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LP5C2LZtZeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if the 96% layout would be for me, at first. I got quite comfortable with how compact and minimal the 75% layout of my K65 was. With the Vanguard Pro 96, though, Corsair has struck a really nice balance that has left me more than happy. You’ve got pretty much the full range of keys you’d expect on here, but with the middle column and space between the arrow-keys and numpad stripped away, they all equally occupy space across the keyboard in a clean, compact way. What’s amazing is that alongside those keys, Corsair have managed to include a rotary volume dial, a 1.9-inch LCD screen display, and a row of 6 programmable macro keys to boot.</p>


<p>The macro keys are so smartly designed – the keyboard has sloped and curved edges instead of flat straight edges, and the macro key row is nestled alongside the left edge of the keyboard along that slope. As a result, your macro keys are easy to see and easy to tap without being too hidden away or, worse, adding the bulk of extra keys to the main layout.</p>


<p>I love the look of the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 keyboard a lot. At first, those soft raised edges of the sturdy aluminum frame betrayed the minimal design I was so used to prioritizing in my choice of keyboard. I cared less and less about that preference the more I used this keyboard, though, eventually coming around to loving how the slightly more expressive frame really draws the eye and makes the keyboard feel just a bit more premium. It matches up perfectly with the soft edges of the provided wrist-pad, too.</p>
<p>If there’s one design flaw I had to point out, though, it would be the USB-C port placement. The port is nestled underneath the middle of the keyboard, but you also need to pinch and thread your cable between two small plastic hooks to properly insert it. Once it’s there, it’s secure and neatly tucked away – but in moments where I had to unplug and replug the USB-C, it definitely caused a bit of an annoyance.</p>
<p>I’m blown away by how good the MGX magnetic switches and double-shot PBT keycaps feel on this keyboard. It’s my first experience with a hall effect keyboard, as I’ve only engaged with hall effect technology in the context of game console controllers. There’s a soft yet sturdy clack to each stroke of the key, and that spacebar press is full of satisfying weight and emphasis each time I click it. The keys never betray my typing speed or heavy hand, and they’re plenty reliable in high-pressure games of Apex Legends or Arc Raiders.</p>

<p>The big thrill with magnetic switch technology is that you’re able to customise them to really get the feel and sensitivity you need. The switches on the Vanguard Pro 96 have a 4.0mm travel distance, but you can adjust them in the Corsair software to hit anywhere from 4.0mm to 0.1mm.</p>
<p>Like some of their other new peripherals, the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 is only customizable via a new lightweight web portal – no more iCue software download required. It’s a relief to be able to get a bit of software bloat removed from my PC, and once you’re in that web portal, you’ve got just as many exhaustive customisation options as you would have expected from the download software. The keyboard RGB is fully customizable, of course, and your programmable macro keys can be set up here to drive anything from daily tasks to in-game macro actions. Smartly, you can even customise and save multiple layers of macro setups, swapping between them depending on what you’re up to. This is also where you can adjust the actuation and reset points for the magnetic switches individually.</p>

<p>It really is so impressive just how much is packed into the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96. Blending an almost full keyboard layout with additional macro keys, a volume dial, a display screen, and even a dedicated Stream Deck button is a lot – but to have all of that come together and still feel like it’s compactly and cleanly contained in this 96% frame is downright marvellous. In a world where so many options for gaming hardware feel like they’re conceding one feature to make room for another, there are no concessions with this keyboard. Well, besides maybe that awkward USB port placement.</p>
