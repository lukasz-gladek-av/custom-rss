		<p>Fictions and Counterplay Games, developer of Godfall, have announced a new game called Armatus, which is a third person roguelite set in the demon filled streets of Paris. The game was shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, but it has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Switch 2. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>

<p>Armatus puts players in the role of a mysterious warrior that has been summoned to defend a group of people who were left behind&nbsp; after the veil opened and those deemed worthy were claimed. Everyone else was left on Earth at the mercy of demons. The unnamed warrior will venture through Paris to fight the demons and learn more about what happened, dying again and again while doing so.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“With&nbsp;Armatus, we wanted our gameplay to be a blend of modern firearms and supernatural powers, plus a little melee for good measure,”</em> said Ming Zhang, Studio Head, Counterplay Games, <em>“By layering in&nbsp; dynamic build choices for each run, we’ve created the frenetic, hyperkinetic combat that really defines our gameplay.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“We’re so thrilled to be working with Ming and the talented team at Counterplay Games to help them bring&nbsp;Armatus&nbsp;to life,”</em> said Kelsey Hansen, Producer, Fictions. <em>“This is a game full of intense, fast-paced combat that truly feels incredible in your hands. We can’t wait for everyone to experience it in 2026.”</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Armatus is due to be released in 2026.</p>

		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has released a new<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid"> Metal Gear Solid</a> Fox Hunt update that includes various tweaks to the publisher’s new multiplayer game while adding a much requested feature.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Trailer | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c46xM5-wScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The most significant change here is how matchmaking works. Previously, players would need to manually select their region which could prolong waiting times depending on your chosen region and the time of day. Now the game will detect if matchmaking is taking too long, widening the search to all regions.</span></p>
<p><span>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Fox Hunt patch 1.2.3 is available to download across all platforms and will need to be installed in order to access the game. Here’s a rundown of what changes have been made.</span></p>
<h3>Metal Gear Solid Fox Hunt Update 1.2.3 Patch Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Added ability to place enemy detection pings while aiming with a knife or gun.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>XP can now be earned in custom matches.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Players will now be matched with others from different regions when matchmaking on their current server takes too long.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Extended the duration of invincibility after respawning.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixed an issue where invincibility after respawn was canceled by rolling or using Naked Sense.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Minor bug fixes and adjustments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fox Hunt launched on October 30th as part of the Snake Eater remake. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/18/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-review/">In our review</a> we scored the multiplayer mode a strong 8/10, saying:</span></p>

<p><span>“Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt multiplayer mode rounds off one of the best remakes of 2025. It offers a surprisingly robust spin on existing battle royale and extraction shooter concepts, with smaller maps and match times working in its favour, successfully incorporating those stealth and strategy elements fans have come to expect.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite our praise, we also noted the game’s lack of content at launch with two modes and a handful of maps. In some ways, this minimal offering works in Fox Hunt’s favour though the lack of a future roadmap is somewhat concerning. Hopefully we’ll hear more from Konami very soon.</span></p>
