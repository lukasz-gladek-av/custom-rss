		<p>Microsoft and Playground Games have confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> will be launching this autumn, and coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fable - Gameplay Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4zJJSEm1ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Featured during the Developer Direct stream, this is really the first good long look that we’ve had at Fable, after years of build up and teasers. From <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/richard-ayoade-reintroduces-us-to-fable-by-playground-games/">the giant Richard Ayoade</a> to little snippets of gameplay with a hero wandering through a fantasy city, battling werewolves and goblins, each trailer so far had been rather short. Now we’ve seen a good bit more.</p>
<p>You begin the game as a child, growing up in Briar Hill, which is when your heroic powers first emerge, marking you as Albion’s first hero in a generation. But then your town and all its people are suddenly turned to stone by a stranger. You have to venture out to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a huge and seamless open world, and it looks gorgeous. At its heart is the capital city of Bowerstone with the huge Fairfax Castle, and all the upper and lower class. To the north, there’s the windswept city of Bloodstone, with two rival gangs vying for power, and the Cult of Shadows.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to pick from a range of character heads, as opposed to having a full character customisation suite, but pair that with tattoos, scars, and a range of outfits to still give yourself an individual look. As in the original game, your playstyle is personalised, blending together melee, ranges and magics. There’s light and heavy combos, building up to slick finishers, while ranged breaks through guard.&nbsp;There’s plenty of returning enemies as well as new ones, like the giant chicken-like cockatrice.</p>
<p>Once again, you can take the game at your own pace, exploring the world. You can buy a house (or all the houses), run a business as a blacksmith or something, marry people, have children, and on and on and on. These are fan-favourite features.</p>
<p>There are more than a thousand people living in this world, getting up, going to work, have hobbies, go to bed, and start it all again. You could even be hiring them, you could be their landlord (or have evicted them). All of these characters are tracked, they have thoughts about you, and they are all fully voiced, and you can talk to them to find out what they think about you.</p>
<p>Morality returns, but it’s not black and white, with a lot of grey areas and subjectivity. Everything you do will earn you a bit of reputation and, again, the people will let you know what they think.</p>
<p>Your choices change the world. Early on you’ll meet Dave – Richard Ayoade – who’s a farmer that manages to grow himself into a giant, and you have to decide what to do about that. If you choose to kill him, then his gigantic corpse will become a fixture of the world and have its impact.</p>
<p>This classic Lionhead RPG series is being revived at Playground Games (better known for their open world arcade racing), but development has naturally taken a good bit longer than has been expected or hoped.</p>
<p>Originally announced way back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">at the start of the generation in 2020</a>, it was three long years before we saw the game next, and then another year after that when the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/fable-gets-another-cinematic-trailer-and-a-release-window/">release was set for 2025</a>. But then in February of last year it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">delayed to 2026</a> with Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan saying “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait, and I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team.”</p>
<p>So, does it look like it’s been worth the wait?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tim Schafer bust into the Developer Direct stream to show off a bit of pottery-making, and talk about their latest Amnesia Fortnight project, turned into a full and broader project. Kiln is all about creating stuff, and then using that stuff to smash your enemies. </p>
<p>Kiln is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC and Xbox Game Pass this spring.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kiln is all in on the top-down 3D brawler aesthetic for its battling, but it starts with creating a pot to anthropomorphise and then send into the fray. You create the shapes, whether with a pottery wheel or just a ball of clay, attack handles, spouts and more, and then transform that into a create or sorts, as your spirit inhabits it. There’s sponges, shapers and straight edge tools, and even just your hands. Each pot needs to be able to roll, punch, jump, and more, and the game has to dynamically figure out how the moves will work. There’s then special attacks like cups sprouting popcorn, plates flinging pies.</p>
<p>Quench is the main game mode, a 4v4 battle mode, where you team needs to carry water into enemy territory and quench their rival furnace. Larger pots will have greater carrying capacity, but be slower to move, so you need to balance your team.</p>

<p>Success earns you XP and chips to spend back in the hub area, where you can spend them on more creative options.</p>
<p>What’s curious is that this is actualy a fairly old game idea for Double Fine. Yes, it came out of an Amnesia Fortnight project, but it was all the way back in 2017! Check that game out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kiln  [Amnesia Fortnight 2017]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVJCxk5VDvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Really interesting to see Double Fine bring an idea like this back and develop it further. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/get-a-long-look-at-game-freaks-beast-of-reincarnation-coming-out-this-summer/</link>

		<p>Game Freak has shared a lot about their upcoming action RPG Beast of Reincarnation, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and Day One on Xbox Game Pass this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, the game features Emma the Sealer, an outcast from society for being a Blighted One, and her giant wolf buddy Koo. They have to journey across a wasteland where this blight has caused unnatural growths to spread, battling robots and monsters along the way. All we can say is that they had better not even do a fake-out death for Koo, or we’ll be very, very angry.</p>
<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There’s different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo ead in to strike first.</p>

<p>The Pokémon developer is getting much more ambitious with their other projects, with Beast of Reincarnation really pushing what they look to achieve with their games on a visual level, and it’s building around demanding, technical combat, which is very much in vogue these days.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 launch confirmed for May, coming first to Xbox and PC, and later to PS5]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-launch-confirmed-for-may-coming-first-to-xbox-and-pc-and-later-to-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1413463</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> is set to launch on 19th May 2026, arriving first for Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Game Pass with an eventual PlayStation 5 release coming at a later point this year, Microsoft has announced alongside a deep dive into the gameplay by Playground games during the Developer Direct stream.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Forza Horizon 6 looks to take the familiar arcade racing format of the series to the next level, thanks in no small part to being fully on this generation, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was a cross-gen release. The game still takes liberties with reality to create a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but the team at Playground Games has brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism” – things like picking 78 as the building number for your first home base, which is lucky in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Once again the Horizon Festival is at the centre of all the racing that you’re taking on. The journey through the game starts as a tourist to Japan, having to first qualify for the Festival, earning wristbands and taking challenges to prove you’re worthy for the next stage and series of events. There’s a new event here with Horizon Rush, tasking you with weaving through obstacle courses to prove your skills. At the end of the road is&nbsp;Legend Island, an exclusive region of the world that only the pinnacle are able to visit.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seasons will also make a return to Forza Horizon 6, and should be as impactful for the Japanese weather as they were for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and its wildly different British seasons. Cherry blossoms in the spring are going to be delightful to see, and they’ll respond realistically to passing cars. It’s built around a ton of photogrammetric data capture of the world, providing the foundation for the world – within that, Tokyo City is five times larger than any urban city before, featuring multiple distinct and visually different districts, but there’s also a broad countryside too.</p>

<p>The team has overhauled the car roster to be better balanced, with the hundreds of cars that have new Forza body kits, liveries that extend to the wind screen, but there’s also some unique creations to collect. Oh, and there’s also authentic tyre wear. The Forza Horizon 6 cover star is the Toyota Gazoo Racing GR GT. It’ll sound great, thanks to new environmental audio processing, hours of ambient sound capture from different seasons.</p>
<p>The shared open world returns with thematic open car meets, where you can turn up and show off your car, and even then just buy copies of the cars that you see. That then bleeds into driving and racing together.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer, they promise, will be easier to get into than ever, and more extensive with full collaborative multiplayer world building tools that you can dive into.</p>
<p>The game’s accessibility suite is pushing on with features like proximity radar for competitive racing, auto drive for when you just want to kick back, and a&nbsp;customisable high contrast mode to aid visually.</p>
<p>The key thing that we’ll have to wait and see is how much this game feels like a new step for the series. There was criticism for Forza Horizon 5 that is was often very similar to Horizon 4, in terms of the cars on offer, the overarching progression and the feel, despite having leapt across from Britain to Mexico. We do expect Horizon 6 to still be an evolution of the formula instead of a wholesale reinvention, but hopefully there’s some more distinguishing touches.</p>
