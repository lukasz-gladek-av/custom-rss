		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles on 26th August, Arrowhead has announced, the game still being published by PlayStation and ported with the help of Sony’s porting specialists at Nixxes.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 will arrive on Xbox with full cross-play to PlayStation and PC, and both Helldivers 2 standard edition and Super Citizen Edition are now available to pre-order on the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement post, game director Mikael Eriksson said, “We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p>
<p>While Microsoft has wholly embraced multiplatform game releases, bringing a number of their core franchises and new releases to PlayStation over the last few years, Sony has always resisted this. Or they’ve resisted propping up their competitor with their key single player titles. While Sony’s ambitions for more live service hits have floundered, the nature and need of these games to have a large player base to sustain them has meant that Sony’s been more open to cross-platform releases… they’ve just not really had the chance to prove it outside of Bungie still being allowed to announced Marathon for Xbox.</p>

<p>This is a pleasant surprise, then, and one that I’m sure many Xbox gamers will be keen to jump aboard and try out. Over the past year and a half, Helldivers 2 has continually evolved, first through the initial flurry of interest and early narrative twists in the Galactic War. As the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/13/helldivers-2-bugs-can-fly-now-despite-what-arrowheads-boss-tells-you/">Terminid</a> and Automaton threats were pushed back, late last year saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">the Illuminate start to emerge</a>, building up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/war-comes-to-super-earth-in-helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update/">a full scale invasion that reached Super Earth itself</a>.</p>
<p>What kind of story will play out next, we don’t know, but having fresh Xbox gamers will certainly help.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the must-play games of the start of 2024, rapidly becoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-sells-12-million-to-become-playstations-new-fastest-selling-game/">PlayStation’s fastest-selling game</a>. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">our Helldivers 2 review</a>, I said, “A naked shower scene away from being an official Starship Troopers game, Helldivers 2 is gloriously daft fun when you can get a group of friends together to play. It’s just a shame about the matchmaking and crash bugs at launch.”</p>
