		<p>Having lived through endless years of terrible movie versions of video games it is rather nice to sit here and write nice things about such a thing, and that thing today is the movie version of Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn/">Until Dawn</a> game.</p>
<p>The trailer confirms what we learned from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/the-until-dawn-movie-teaser-explains-how-the-branching-narrative-will-be-used/">teaser,</a> in that the group of teens are trapped in a house with time resetting after they are killed, a novel way of allowing the film to explore the branching narrative found in the game. From then on we get hints of some of the grisly deaths that will occur, many of which seem to be taken from the game. We also get to see the Wendigo and Clown killer, also from the game, along with some new evil creatures including a witch and giant.</p>

<p>That looks like the perfect Friday night popcorn movie</p>
<p>Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game, but here he seems to be working at a gas station rather than playing he role of Dr. Alan J. Hill, “The Analyst”, the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice. The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<p>This year will also see the release of the odd looking Minecraft movie in April, a sequel to 2021’s Mortal Kombat film in October, and another sequel, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in December.</p>
<p>Return to Silent Hill finished shooting in February 2024 but does not have a release date yet,&nbsp; that really should show up this year unless the studio are messing about with it. The Watch Dogs movie also finished filming in the middle of last year so that may show up as well, it currently has no release date.</p>

		<p>It’s been an exciting little day at TSA towers what with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2 announcement</a> and everything, but not everyone is into plumbers who drive around in go-karts, or consoles where you can take the sides off. If you’re more of a multiplayer extraction shooter type of gamer, then the news that Exoborne, the latest game from Sharkmob, the team behind Bloodhunt, is getting a playtest next month might raise your pulse a little more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GZwprbl0ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Exoborne certainly looks the part, with players wrapped up in mechanical Exo-Rigs. These versatile tools are designed for survival and combat and they can be customised depending on the mission at hand. We got to take a look at the game during last year’s Gamescom, and storms seem to play a massive part, providing both visual impact, and deadly gameplay scenarios.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of gunplay and action on show, with some nods to previous Exosuit-equipped games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and even a touch of Bioware’s Anthem. It looks hard-hitting, chaotic and all kinds of fun. Of course, they’re entering into a crowded genre, so the playtest is a perfect way to gain feedback from players and to garner interest ahead of its launch later in the year.</p>
<p>Brynley Gibson, Executive Producer says, “We’ve been conducting closed tests both online and in our studio for quite some time, but this marks our first large-scale test, and it’s an incredibly exciting milestone for us. By entering this stage of open collaboration with the community, we’re eager to gather invaluable insights and feedback that will drive us to elevate the game to new heights.”</p>


<p>The Exoborne playtest will run from Feburary 12th to February 17th, and while the game will launch on console alongside its desktop brethren, the playtest is limited to PC only. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">sign up for it right here</a>, and don’t forget to check out the new trailer as well.</p>
