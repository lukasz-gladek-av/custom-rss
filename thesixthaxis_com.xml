		<p>Coming up on a decade since the debut of Transport Fever, Urban Games have figured a few things out about their transport simulation series. Years of post-launch support, added features and working with their community is leading to their most ambitious game yet, when Transport Fever 3 launches this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Transport Fever 3 - First Look: Infrastructure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eyDKt6C1kC0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sticking with their in-house game engine, they’re able to roll a bunch of features and ideals from where Transport Fever 2 has ended up into Transport Fever 3 on day one. That means that this will be a fully synchronous release across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, when TF2 rolled into the console station a few years after PC, and it also means that cross-platform modding, which was only added to TF2 in 2024, will also be there on day one.</p>


<p>If you’re in it for the economic simulation, then Transport Fever 3 promises even greater depths than before. There’s over a century of transportation history here, starting in 1900 with the city, buildings and cars you see all changing and evolving as you carry on through to 2030. That means there’s over 290 vehicles, ranging from buses and trucks, through ships, planes, trains and even new cargo trams and helicopters. Cargo trams are a particularly interesting one, having been used in Eastern Europe to bring cargo into city centres instead of noisy, smelly trucks –&nbsp;something you’ll need to keep tabs on now, as every citizen in the map is fully simulated with places to work, shop and live, and their happiness will depend on pollution, noise levels and traffic jams.</p>
<p>And you’ll have a fresh appreciation for cargo in this game, as there are now 35 cargo types and it is now no longer handled automatically. If TF2 was all about money, then in TF3 it’s just one of many things to manage.</p>


<p>All of this will add new depths to the transport simulation sandbox, but TF3 will lean further into the tycoon gameplay and story objectives to overcome through a campaign of eight maps. Each one picks a particular period in history and takes inspiration from real events, using these missions as a way to introduce new concepts and keep things varied –&nbsp;there could be competition against an AI, a countdown mission with a timer, and more.</p>
<p>We sampled two of the levels, first heading to Mardi Gras in 1906, but finding that the city has been partially flooded and ruined by a storm. This is purely a narrative conceit here –&nbsp;while this game now has a day/night cycle and weather effects, they are purely cosmetic so as not to add crazy variables to the simulation – but it means that Mayor LaFontaine, the helpful Andrew and Miss Baker are banding together to rescue this year’s festival. LaFontaine wants a new hotel, while Miss Baker pushes him and you to help represent the black community and less wealthy, and Andrew’s just happy to be helpful.</p>

<p>Setting up transport routes, repairing roads and bridges and shuffling the good around that each objective needs gradually gets you used to the user interface, though it’s initially a little unclear how to go about certain tasks. I accidentally clicked through and sold off a couple horse and carts when cancelling an unneeded line, instead of having them sent back to the depot, and when I wanted a ship to go between collecting fish and shrimp, returning to dock between each, it took me a moment to realise I couldn’t drag the stops into a different order and had to set things up a different way.</p>
<p>But with Mardi Gras rescued, I could turn my attention to another festival in need, some sixty years later, with a somewhat legally distinct rendition of Woodstock. Now it’s a local sheriff and an enthusiastic rock organiser who will have to put aside any of the very surface level differences to make this a success, oh and Andrew’s still there to help out, though he’s now a bit of an old-timer.</p>

<p>The objectives have grown in scale by this point, so you need a bunch more wood to construct the stage, and the growing encampment needs plenty of food (and veggie food too, please) which is over on the other end of the map. Do you just get a truck to drive it across, or use the port nearby to ship it to the nearest town for trucks to pick up? It all builds up to a festival that’s as successful as you can make it accommodate people.</p>
<p>I feel that these narrative missions and tycoon gameplay will really help make Transport Fever 3 more accessible. I often find myself at a bit of a loose end when simply presented with a sandbox, so while that absolutely remains, having both a way to ease players into the simulation, and to give objectives in an intelligent way that keeps you more engaged will be great.</p>

		<p>Marking the first birthday of Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, the game is out now for PlayStation 5, and a meaty anniversary update has been released for the game on PC and Xbox Series X|S. The game is also now available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> tier, having originally been tied to ‘Day One’ elligible tiers.*</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Anniversary Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NO_uAjEhEpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On a high level, the anniversary update has added three new races that you can create your character as – dwarves, orlan and aumaua – and there’s a new quarterstaff weapon that you can adopt.</p>
<p>While the game wasn’t designed with it in mind, New Game Plus has also been added for anyone that has a save that’s passed the point of no return and beaten the game. Starting over, the only real caveat is that weapon levelling will not persist, but that’s fine because you’ll be nice and mighty in other ways.</p>
<p>And you can show off how mighty you are with a photo mode to capture specific moments while you’re playing.</p>

<p>Avowed was one of the highlights for Xbox and PC gamers last year, though one a little overlooked for launching in February and perhaps not being as broad as some might have liked, following on from the PIllars of Eternity games. “Avowed is an incredible RPG,” we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">our review</a>. “Its vibrant world and stellar cast make every moment a joy to take part in, enhanced by a script that gives equal measure to drama, action and humour. Coming hot on the heels of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Microsoft’s software revival is well underway.”</p>



<p><wbr><br>
<b>New Game&nbsp;Plus</b>&nbsp;is now available after completing the main story. This mode is designed to reward mastery, experimentation,&nbsp;and making the all-powerful build.&nbsp;<wbr><br>
<b>When starting a New Game&nbsp;Plus&nbsp;save,&nbsp;players will bring along with them:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>All&nbsp;unlocked abilities (with the exception of&nbsp;godlike abilities which are gained through story progression/world exploration)&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All spent attribute points&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unique weapons and armors—but they are reset to level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unlocked enchantments&nbsp;remain&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unique gloves and boots&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All necklaces, all rings, and all trinkets&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Any&nbsp;<i>equipped</i>&nbsp;Common Weapons or Armor items are kept, but they are reset to level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The following&nbsp;are&nbsp;removed from the player at the start of a New Game Plus:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>All common weapons and armor that&nbsp;<i>aren’t</i>&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Companions must be picked up via story progression&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Companions keep their talent points and start at level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>All resources that had been collected</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Gold&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Upgrade materials&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enchanting materials&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Food ingredients&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>All consumables that had been collected</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>All potions&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All food&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>All quest items&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>All god totems/trinkets&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>Fast travel points/fog of war&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>The&nbsp;aforementioned godlike&nbsp;abilities</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>To ensure challenge scales alongside player power:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enemy stats are increased across the board&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enemies now have a chance to have modifiers applied to them&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Elemental Modifiers&nbsp;</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Fire: Immune to Fire damage and accumulation. Attacks also now deal Fire damage.&nbsp;<wbr></li>

<li>Shock: Immune to Shock damage and accumulation. Attacks also now deal Shock damage.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Poison: Immune to Poison damage and accumulation. Attacks also now&nbsp;deal&nbsp;Poison damage.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Bleed: Immune to Bleed damage and accumulation. Attacks also now&nbsp;deal&nbsp;Bleed damage.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Physical Modifiers&nbsp;</b><wbr></p>

<li>Attribute&nbsp;stat cap&nbsp;rises&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>15 to&nbsp;30</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>An important note for those who have already completed&nbsp;<i>Avowed</i></b>: Since New Game Plus is being added post release and the game was not initially designed with it in mind, a completion save will be necessary&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;take advantage of the mode. You will need to load a point of no return save or later and beat the game to make a proper New Game Plus save.&nbsp;<wbr></p>

<p>Included in the anniversary update is a major expansion to character creation:&nbsp;<b>three new playable species</b>&nbsp;join the existing Humans and Elves.&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dwarves</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;The most well-traveled species in Eora, the stout dwarves are known for their great strength and tenacity.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>Orlans</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Their two-toned skin, prominent ears,&nbsp;and&nbsp;hirsute bodies all in the smallest size of Kith&nbsp;make them stand&nbsp;outs&nbsp;in Eora.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>Aumaua</b>&nbsp;– Towering, powerfully built, and physically imposing.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do the&nbsp;different species&nbsp;change how you look,&nbsp;the team&nbsp;has also added in stat bonuses for all species adding another layer to character creation.&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Humans</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>+1 Might&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>+1 Resolve&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>+1 Perception&nbsp;<wbr></li>

<p><b>Improved Character Creation</b><wbr><br>

<wbr></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda has released update 1.2 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skyrim</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, fully addressing the woeful performance that blighted the game’s latest port. It follows on from an update shortly after its December release that quickly removed the frame rate cap to improve latency, but now tackles this with a full 60fps performance mode, fixes to visual glitches, and more.</p>
<p>The game performance is the most significant improvement, a new toggle under the Display settings letting you prioritise visuals or performance. This tweaks visual settings and resolution targets in order to deliver 60fps, which from anecdotal online accounts seems to be pretty solid. Additionally, the 30fps visuals have been locked back to this frame rate and the graphics tweaked to give steadier performance.</p>


<p>It’s a huge shame that the game couldn’t have had this degree of performance and refinement at its original release, as it led to a lot of bad reviews – we ended up having to give it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-switch-2-review/">a 5/10 because of the issues</a>. However, it does give a glimmer of optimism for the Fallout 4 port to Switch 2 which is set to drop next week.</p>
<p>The Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 patch notes are as follows</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.</li>
<li>In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Performance Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.</li>
<li>Fixed an audio-related crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.</li>
<li>Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations:
<ul>
<li>during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove</li>
<li>during combat at Secunda’s Kiss</li>
<li>when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location</li>
<li>when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visuals Issues Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.</li>
<li>Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.</li>
<li>Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.</li>
<li>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.</li>
<li>The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.</li>
