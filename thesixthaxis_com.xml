		<p>Awaken Realms has revealed its next project and it is a maritime based narrative RPG called Tides of Blazefall. You are a sea captain who has forgotten their identity and is sailing the Forlorn Sea of Evershade to discover its secrets. You are not alone though as the Masks, voices in your head, accompany you, and try to influence your choices.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Blazefall - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qtbn4-SYFKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Masks do not just advise and try to influence your decisions, but have a direct influence on your battle strategy. The cards that you use in battle are directly influenced by the Masks, so if you are allied with one in particular it will be their cards that make up the deck. As a ship captain you can’t sail the Forlorn Sea alone, so you are able to recruit crewmembers that can provide upgrades to the ship, which are going to be needed as you navigate the waves, storms, and unexpected events.</p>
<p>Exploring the open sea and making choices that shape the narrative of Tides of Blazefall are not the only things you do. You need a home base where your ship can find safety, so you are also tasked with turning a derelict pier into a proper stronghold from where you can take up new quests and get even better ships to make it easier to search the seas. A demo for Tides of Blazefall will go live on February 23rd, and it will include 30+ minutes of gameplay, 30+ pages of text,&nbsp;11 masks defining your character’s traits, 20+ cards, 5 followers, 3 player ships, 6 different duels and one artifact.</p>

<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Tides of Blazefall, and the game has only been confirmed for PC at this time.</p>

		<p>Dotemu, Guard Crush, and Supamonks have announced the release of Absolum’s major 1.1 update, titled Threads of Fate, with this update bringing new features to the game. The headline features include Mystic Ordeals, which are modifiers that can alternate runs, and Corrupted Biomes which are more dangerous areas of a map but promise better rewards than if you choose to avoid them. There are also new skins, emotes, and upgrade mounts as part of the Absolum 1.1 update.</p>
