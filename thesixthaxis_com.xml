		<p>NetEase Games and Marvel has announced that Marvel Rivals’ first seasonal event will be starting on December 20th, and it is called Winter Celebration. This event will add a new limited time 4v4 mode called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, where everyone plays as Jeff in what looks like a mode inspired by Splatoon.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Winter Celebration will allow all players to unlock items like the Jeff the Land Shark: Cuddly Fuzzlefin costume, nameplate, and spray by completing certain objectives. Other Winter themed costumes are going to be added to the Marvel Rivals too, though these cannot be unlocked for free by the looks of things. Groot, Rocket, Venom, and Magik are all getting these winter themed costumes.</p>

<p>While we haven’t review Marvel Rivals, Nick did play it before release and in his preview wrote, “Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I’m gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.”</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals did launch on December 6th, and it is living up to some of its potential as a multiplayer shooter. You can play it for free now.</p>
