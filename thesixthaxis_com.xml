		<p>Triangle Wave turned up to Day of the Devs with a trailer for Stretchmancer, their overly flexible puzzle game that will have you stretching, pushing, squishy, pushing and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="STRETCHMANCER - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm-P_ptCB2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>(This is the announcement trailer from earlier this year)</p>
<p>As you try to save the world from the Claustro Empire, you’ll be using your unique ability to morph the world around you to escape prison and go on a bit of a puzzle-solving rampage. You’ve got two forms of this ability, the right hand pushing things and the left hand pulling them, stretching and squashing, and potentially doing both at the same time.</p>
<p>The game started off as a Ludum Dare game jam title, but is now being grown into a full sized title with publisher Offbrand Games. The title is still in the prototyping phase, such as exploring how water might fill shrinking spaces. It’s no surprise that Triangle Wave has created a custom game engine to handle all of this.</p>

<p>Definitely one to keep an eye on!</p>
