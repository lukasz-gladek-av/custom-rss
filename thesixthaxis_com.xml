		<p>REPO has given been one final development update before the year is up, and developer Semiwork has listened to the feedback of what a lot of players wanted. Yes, players will be able use a walkie talkie to communicate when the next REPO update is released. Additionally, there will also be a leaf blower so you can blow away enemies and allies alike.</p>
<p><iframe title="BIG NEW THINGS coming to R.E.P.O." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wozEOeJlICY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The walkie talkie and leaf blower will not be the only things coming to REPO in its next update. Semiwork has confirmed that it will be overhauling the in game shop with a new visual design and new features including an Upgrade Re-Roller that lets you re-roll upgrades for a fee. The team is also working on improving vehicles and making them more intuitive to use across the maps. One of the changes will include adding drifting to the semiscooter. There was also confirmation that Semiwork is targeting 2026 to release REPO into version 1.0.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>
