		<p>Bungie have finally revealed their new version of Marathon, a team-based extraction shooter set on the world of Tau Ceti 4. While the gunplay looks classic Bungie the art style is bright and rather cartoonish with chunky 8-bit style fonts and glitching effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZRGDZCl9pg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will have up to eighteen players battling it out alongside AI enemies but while you can be in a team of three, you can opt out of matchmaking and play solo if you wish. The idea is to grab as much loot and escape, die and your loot will be dropped and claimed by someone else. More loots means a better loadout on the next run.&nbsp; The game will feature “events” which have yet to be detailed, dynamic weather, end game content, community events and seasonal stories. Each runner will have implants which you can use to enhance shields, agility and other abilities.</p>

<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

<p>Marathon will launch on September 23rd 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC.</p>
