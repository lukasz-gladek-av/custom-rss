		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it will start delisting Football Manager 2024 from storefronts, and the process will begin on November 5th. The reason for the delisting is the end of license agreements and new ones likely being agreed for Football Manager 26. There does not seem to be any kind of discount for Football Manager 2024 ahead of its delisting. The dates for the delistings are below.</p>



<p>As you can see from the table, Football Manager 2024 will be delisted tomorrow from Steam and the Epic Games Store, including the demo. Then on November 16th the game will be removed from Windows Store, PC Game Pass, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Game Pass. On 18th November, Football Manager 2024 will be removed from PS5’s store, and on December 5th Football Manager 2024 Touch will be removed from the Nintendo Switch Store. Those playing FM24 Touch on Apple Arcade and FM24 Mobile via Netflix will be able to upgrade to Football Manager 26.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 2024 review I wrote, “There’s a lot of depth to Football Manager 2024, but how deep you go is up to you. You can sit back and just focus on the basics of the match day and transfers, or you can all the way to managing individual player training and using the new player targets feature Whatever approach you choose, Football Manager 2024 offers a near full package to start or continue your managerial career.”</p>
