		<p>EA has just given us the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer reveal, confirming that the game will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 10th October, as well as beta tests that will take place in August.</p>

<p>That’s right, Battlefield 6 is coming out in October, but you’ll be able to play before then with two beta weekends. The first is coming next week, in fact, with a beta running from 7th August, with codes available from Twitch drops from people streaming today or pre-ordering the game. This will morph into an open beta test on 9th August and run through the 10th.</p>
<p>A second Battlefield 6 open beta weekend will take place from 14th-17th August.</p>
<p>Classes are back alongside signature weapons and abilities that fit into the archetypes of games before and 2042</p>

<p>There will be 9 maps at launch including an Operation Firestorm remake, Gibraltar, Egypt<br>
Tajikistan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough game mode are joined by the likes of TDM, Squad DM, Domination and KOTH.</p>
<p>More maps and modes will arrive in seasonal content, while BF Portal returns as editing tools and modifiers for gameplay.</p>
<p>Officially unveiled last week, Battlefield 6 is a huge production for EA, with the Battlefield Studios comprised of Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios, all with different roles to play in its creation. Criterion and Motive have focused on the single player campaign, which will see NATO attacked and going on the counter-offensive against the private military group known as Pax Armata. This announcement trailer brought us plenty of cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>A lot of this was echoed in the multiplayer reveal, which takes players to some rather familiar looking streets for The Division players, over the river from the main city, fighting in the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge. The war extends from the US through to the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets.</p>
<p>We’re going hands on with the game shortly, so keep your eyes peeled for our Battlefield 6 preview very, very soon.</p>
