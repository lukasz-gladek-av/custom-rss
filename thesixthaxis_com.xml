		<p>nDreams has confirmed the release date of its debut title from its nDreams Elevation label, and that game is Reach. Reach, which is described as mix of puzzle solving and combat, will be available from October 16th for PSVR 2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR. To mark this announcement, nDreams has released a brand new trailer which showcases Reach’s gameplay including some combat and a look at the environment.</p>

<p><em>“We’re thrilled to shine a spotlight on some of&nbsp;Reach’s most intricate gameplay mechanics in our latest trailer and open up pre-orders,”</em> commented Glenn Brace, Head of Studio, nDreams Elevation. <em>“The response from early previews has been incredible, and we can’t wait for players to experience firsthand the depth and VR-first innovation we’ve built into every aspect of the game.”</em></p>

<p>The story of Reach casts players as a hero who is sent on a reluctant journey to learn the secrets of an underground civilisation, but that is far from simple as this civilisation is hostile to the player’s incursion. That means players will have to face off against mythical and dangerous threats, while finding a path through this mysterious world. Those who pre-order Reach will get a Traditional Ferran outfit, the Ornate Bow, the Ferran Guard Shield, the Traditional Gauntlets, the Ornate Drone.</p>

		<p>Last month, Dredge developer Black Salt Games announced its second studio called Disc 2 Games, and now the first project from this new studio has been announced. Canvas City is a turn based RPG where roller skates and graffiti tags are the implements of choice to gain victory over rivals. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer, which provides a look at tagging and battling.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Unlisted] Canvas City - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo40fiREHzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Movement isn’t just getting from one spot to another, it’s part of the plan”</em>&nbsp;explains Technical Director Kris Nicholson.&nbsp;<em>“Chaining tricks and attacks mid-turn changes how you think about positioning and opens up new ways to win.”</em></p>
<p>In Canvas City, battles take place between rival crews with each one having their own goals. Some of these crews are backed by corporations while others are freestylers trying to claim the streets back from an oppressive regime. Players can recruit up to 12 different skaters, each with their own skill sets to take on the different crews and aim to beat them to progress in the story. The gameplay of Canvas City does not just consist of attacking enemy crew members though. To power up abilities, characters need to pull off tricks and attack to build up Style Points. These style points are then used to activate more powerful abilities. As you progress through the game new upgrades will be unlocked to make your crew more powerful, allowing them to take on the tougher challenges that will come their way.</p>

<p>Canvas City is due to be released for PC and Nintendo Switch, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
