		<p>Discord has announced that it will start rolling out its age verification checks globally in March, getting ahead of the legislation that is being introduced by various regions around the world. All users will now have a “teen-appropriate” experience by default, with new settings, age-gated restrictions to more adult servers and spaces, and content filtering.</p>
<p>Building on the existing technology used for the UK, Australia, and other clamped down markets, Discord’s age verification will have two methods: facial age estimation scans and uploaded government IDs. In the former instance, they state that video selfies are processed on-device and will not be uploaded, while also stated that any uploaded IDs will be deleted “quickly”. Some users will be asked to provide multiple forms of age verification, and Discord is also using an age inference model to try and figure out if your account is adult from behaviours.</p>


<p>Without verifying, the following will be imposed:</p>
<ul role="list">
<li><strong>Content Filters:</strong> Discord users will need to be age-assured as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting.</li>
<li><strong>Age-gated Spaces</strong> – Only users who are age-assured as adults will be able to access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands.</li>
<li><strong>Message Request Inbox:</strong> Direct messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and access to modify this setting is limited to age-assured adult users.</li>
<li><strong>Friend Request Alerts:</strong> People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Restrictions:</strong> Only age-assured adults may speak on stage in servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally there is a large amount of pushback from the communities and users of the prevalent chat platform. A lot of people do not like this kind of verification and feel it to be a gross invasion of privacy, even with assurances. After all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/discord-data-breach-leaks-70000-government-ids-used-for-age-verification/">Discord was able to leak a reported 70,000 government IDs last year</a>, highlighting the main weakness in these kinds of systems: third party partners.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users should be able to get by without the addition verification, but there’s plenty reports of false positives and negatives from facial scans, especially within that tricky 16-20 year old age bracket. A lot of 17 year olds will get approved, a lot of 18 year olds won’t. This then brings the more troubling need for government ID to be uploaded, and if these IDs aren’t deleted quickly enough by Discord’s third party partners, that can be a weak point in security.</p>

<p>Discord has partnered with k-ID, which is also used by Meta and Snap, and Swiss company Privately for the facial scans. In a statement to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Ars Technica</a>, they state that&nbsp;“the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”</p>

		<p>Riot Games has announced that it is reducing the development team behind the free to play League of Legends fighter 2XKO just a few weeks after the game launched into 1.0 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. 2XKO has been in early access for PC since October so the team could work on features with feedback ahead of the main launch which took place on January 20th.</p>
<p><iframe title="2XKO Season 1 2026 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2XKO’s executive producer Tom Cannon released a statement which said, <em>“Hey Everyone. I wanted to take a moment to share an important update on 2XKO. This is a difficult update to share, but we want to be clear about what’s changing and why. After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team. I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon. Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the FGC.&nbsp; Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate. This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me. The people who helped ship 2XKO poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful. We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition – including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance where it’s not.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing. In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game. Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">It appears then that 2XKO has not broken through into the mainstream and gained a sizeable audience that allows the team to operate as it does. What this may mean then is content being released at a slower rate as fewer people work on the game. 2XKO’s luck could turn around in the future and that may in turn see the team increase in size again. Only time will tell.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/atlanta-td-is-already-the-most-beautiful-tower-defence-game-of-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We all have our favourite genres, but I’m not sure how many people would put tower defence at the top of their tier list. Those people are, of course, wrong, as tower defence games are often the perfect, brain-massaging mix of action, puzzling and sitting back to watch the carnage play out. And, they make you feel smart. So, we were definitely excited to catch the announcement for Atlanta TD, a brand new tower defence game coming to Steam Early Access in 2026. It helps, that this is one of the most beautiful tower defence games we’ve ever seen. </p>
<p><iframe title="Atlanta TD is coming..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfsGozFytTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>


<p>Atlanta TD has some serious 80s anime vibes going on, tying stunning pixel art to an art direction that pulls thematically from series like The Lost City of Gold and Ulysses 31. That immediately puts it straight to the top of my wishlist, but when you read into the storyline and setup, this is really a game that’s doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is a procedurally generated roguelite tower defence game set in Atlanta, where the Gods of Olympus must defend their home against the oncoming hordes of Ares’ armies. With Zeus fallen and the Four Spectacular Realms seemingly defenceless, you must call upon the remaining Gods to protect the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“While I was at university, I always had this idea to make a pixel art tower defence game – but outside of that idea, I could never really nail down the Unique Selling Point.” Shared lead developer Jake Meyer. “Shortly after graduating, I started a YouTube channel around game development which got a fair bit of attention – and while looking for a job, I thought I could start this project, release it within a year and document the entire process on YouTube – 3 years on, I think it’s safe to say how that turned out.</p>


<p>“I worked on this project in my spare time over a year and a half – building the idea, the design and the lore of Atlanta – before pitching it to Tin Man Games, who were in a transitional period from their previous project, and was extremely fortunate to have been able to work on it with them since then. We now have had an amazing team who have contributed to it to produce something bigger than I ever could have imagined – and seeing it get to this stage and feel so real is the most incredible feeling, and I am so excited for people to be able to play it!”</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is launching on Steam Early Access in 2026. For more information, you can follow Tin Man Games on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thetinminions.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and Facebook, as well as joining the offical <a href="https://discord.com/invite/deTfTTmZna">Tin Man Games Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Auction Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/dark-auction-review/</link>
            <guid>1430821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How many stories have you experienced in your lifetime? From picture books as a kid, to films, TV shows, novels, audiobooks, and videogames, do you have a rough number? Are we talking thousands? More? Well, let me tell you right now, amongst all those thousands upon thousands of stories you’ve experienced, you’ve never encountered a yarn quite like the tale that Dark Auction is telling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Auction - Story, Mystery &amp; Bidding Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9181j4NedQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially a visual novel with some – very – slight gameplay elements, Dark Auction follows protagonist Noah Crawford on a seemingly simple task of retrieving his father from an auction. Rather ominously though, Noah discovers that this auction is taking place in a spooky European-like castle in the middle of a mist-soaked woodland. The items being auctioned? Well, they belonged to ‘Dictator X’, who, to all intents and purposes, is Hitler. Noah is soon trapped in the castle with a bunch of other veritable inmates. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Each of them is a genuinely engaging character, with a lot of depth to uncover and fascinating motivations behind their actions and behaviours. They all feel like fully rounded personalities that you’ll want to get to know. Which is a very good thing, as most of your time in the game will be spent conversing with your fellow auctioneers. </p>


<p>Anyway, soon Noah is strong-armed by men wearing Parrot masks – yep, not making this up – to do their bidding. Literally their bidding, as much of Dark Auction takes place within an auction house. These scenes play out akin to the trials in the Phoenix Wright series. It is up to Noah to spot the errors in a character’s memories – it’s via memories, rather than money, that people place their bids and unlock the artefact they desire – and then attempt to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>Noah gathers the information he’ll need by slowing strolling around a handful of rooms, talking to NPC’s in an attempt to learn more about them, whilst adding ideas to his mental ‘word cloud’ – a handy mechanic that enables him to spot the inaccuracies during an auction testimony and provide the contradictory evidence. He does this not to attack the participants, but to support them, usually guiding them through a traumatic moment of their lives in the process.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like a bewildering hodgepodge of ideas, then that’s because, well, it is. Yet somehow all these disparate elements of the plot – Hitler, therapeutic auction sessions, parrot men, post-war Europe, trauma, heck, even time travel – meld together rather neatly. Offering a fresh, compelling and often rather tense narrative that will keep you clicking through reams of dialogue from beginning to end. Though with a story from the mind of Rika Suzuki – the writing talent behind Nintendo DS classics like the Another Code series and the superb noir-thriller Hotel Dusk: Room 215 – the fact that the narrative is uniquely brilliant is no real surprise.</p>
<p>Where Dark Auction struggles, then, is in its presentation. Visually, during the exploration phases, Dark Auction feels ancient. There are both 3D third-person and first-person elements, and these look and handle like one of the early Resident Evil remakes. Despite the simplicity, the frame rate on Nintendo Switch is lousy; character models are blocky and lack sufficient animation to give them any personality. The environments themselves are devoid of atmosphere and detail, often robbing the game of the tension that the scripted elements have worked so hard to build. </p>

<p>Outside of dialogue, far too much time is spent wandering into a room and being forced to look at every clue until the game allows you to leave again. It’s repetitive and feels like unnecessary padding, keeping you from getting to the good bit, such as the next surprising twist or informing reveal during an auction. The auctions themselves and the talking heads dialogue moments also benefit from losing the lousy 3D and going full 2D, all gorgeous character art and smooth flowing movements.</p>
