		<p>Remedy Entertainment has shared a gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>, their highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. The video runs for a few minutes, showcasing some of Dylan’s growing abilities, the game’s combat style and the twisted world you’ll be battling through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Gameplay Reveal | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA71hdzim0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer picks up with Dylan on the trail of a Resonant, heading through an Inception-like folded rendition of Manhattan. He revcently acquired Shift as an ability, which allows him to defy the already broken gravity. His weapon is another transforming tool, but compared to the multi-tool gun of Control, this is all about melee. He also has more supernatural abilities for range, and the game looks to encourage you to switch between range and melee</p>
<p>The trailer builds up to snippets of a crazy battle against a giant laser-spewing whale or something, but that’s not the Resonant. No, that seems to be a kind of hammer-wielding ballet dancer?</p>
<p>Clearly there’s plenty more that Remedy don’t want to show just yet, but we’re excited for this one – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-control-resonant/">Control Resonant was right up there on our Most Wanted Games of 2026.</a></p>

<p>Control Resonant is expected to release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

		<p>The co-op Legends mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will launch on March 10th as a free update for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei Legends - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participated in Raids, and played as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format.</p>
<p><em>“Legends will launch with three mission types. In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps. You’ll fight to control territory on each map. While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage. Each map will have its own unique Curses and Blessings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In Story, you’ll team up with another player to tackle a series of 12 missions. After completing each set of three Story missions, you’ll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six. Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</em></p>

<p><em>As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we’ll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With less than a month to go before release, Bungie has announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> open preview weekend – a “server slam” – will take place the weekend before the full launch on 5th March. From 26th February to 2nd March, all platforms will be able to jump in and get an introduction to the game’s take on the extraction shooter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Gameplay Trailer | Marathon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXhQbF7TlbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will be just an introduction to Marathon’s content, with additional maps, factions, contracts and more coming in the full game and then through Season 1. However, it will serve the main purposes for the game, being a bit of a demo for players, and a test for the game’s servers.</p>
<p>The Server Slam will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infil into two zones:
<ul>
<li>Perimeter</li>
<li>Dire Marsh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take on the opening contracts for five of Marathon’s factions</li>
<li>Try out all six Runner Shells, plus Rook in scavenger mode</li>
<li>Solo queue, proximity chat, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Season 1 will then bring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two more zones
<ul>
<li>Outpost</li>
<li>Cryo Archive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full contract and progression trees unlocked for all six factions</li>
<li>Ranked mode</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, rewards can be earned during the test that will roll through to your profile at release. There will be a special emblem and banner to show you were first, and you’ll be able to earn a launch bundle with weapons, body implants, and more.</p>
<p>Oh, and PS Plus players will be able to claim a trio of weapon charms for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> – Onryō Weapon Charm</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> – Battle Guitar Weapon Charm</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> – For Freedom Weapon Charm</li>
</ul>
<p>So, are you going to give it a go later this month?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[God of War Trilogy Remake announced and God of War Son of Sparta is out now!]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-and-god-of-war-son-of-sparta-out-now/</link>

		<p>Sony have announced something new for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a> but sadly it’s not a brand new game in the main series. God of War Trilogy Remake is in “very early” development and will be, as the name suggests, a remake of the first three games set in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, is returning, but no further information was released. I wonder if they will keep the rather saucy minigames?</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Trilogy Remake - Announcement Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_tq12WisX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In God of War (2005), Kratos serves Ares, the God of War, after pledging himself in desperation during battle. Manipulated by Ares into slaughtering his own wife and daughter, he eventualy ends up killin Ares and taking the title for himself.</p>
<p>The second game has Kratos stripped of all his powers by Zeus, killed, and banished to the underworld. He eventually teams up with the Titans, rewinds time and attacks Mount Olympus. Clearly not learning his lesson from the first time, Zeus then kills him again in the third game. Very careless, Kratos!</p>

<p>Also announced is a brand new game in the franchise, but it’s not what you might expect. God of War Sons of Sparta is a side-scrolling combat game that tells the story of a young Kratos, before he became the God of War. The game is out right now on PlayStation 5!</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Sons of Sparta - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFhOo6NTt70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
<em><br>
“God of War Sons of Sparta is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his brutal training at the Spartan Agoge alongside his brother Deimos. They must overcome threats that will put all their training to the test while confronting the true meaning of duty and honor.”</em></p>
