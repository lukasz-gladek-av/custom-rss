		<p>A brand new city builder called Amberspire has been announced by Bithell Games and Lunar Division, with this providing a twist on the genre by being dice based. Set on an abandoned moon orbiting a gas giant, the fate of how the city grows and flourishes will depend on the dice rolls. The dice determine which resources you get, meaning you will have to adapt the city to what they provide. This will not be the only challenge as the moon’s environment will provide its own challenges, and different factions will spring up, which can upset the harmony you will be trying to create.</p>

<p>Amberspire’s key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dice-driven systems</strong>&nbsp;govern resources, buildings, weather, and events. Dice guide you to play reactively and create interesting scenarios.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Systemic ecology and citizen dynamics</strong>&nbsp;create a lively and unique world. The residents of your city grow according to their environment. Likewise, the weather and ecology of the moon respond to the increasing number of buildings and can threaten your progress.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Factions and political drama</strong>&nbsp;can dramatically affect your capabilities. Dynamic events infuse the story of your city as factions compete with each other.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hand-drawn isometric art</strong>&nbsp;beautifully realize the buildings that comprise your city, and lush portraits depict the many factions in the galaxy.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>An original soundtrack</strong>&nbsp;composed by nervous_testpilot that brings to life the unique world of Amber and its moon.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A release date for Amberspire is yet to be confirmed, and it appears that it is PC only.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/"> Amberspire can be wishlisted on Steam now.</a></p>
