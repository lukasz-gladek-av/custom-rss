		<p>The rugger’s back again this weekend for all us seasonal fans that basically just turn up for the Six Nations. There’s a potential title decider starting things off, a two-sided redemption quest up in Scotland, and we’ll see if Italy can break their one remaining duck in the competition tomorrow.</p>
<p>But we’re here for the gaming news and headlines of the week, and Nacon Connect gave us a good few game announcements.</p>
