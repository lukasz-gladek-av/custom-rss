			<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we’re being assaulted by a barrage of new peripherals to go alongside it. Turtle Beach, never one to miss an opportunity to sell the odd headset or two, have seen fit to launch an all-new version of the Airlite Fit, previously a PDP product but now brought under the welcoming branches of the palm tree-toting brand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Airlite Fit" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ucyy5jaW_-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a budget headset. At £27.99 – and available for as low as £19.99 – the Airlite Fit is seriously affordable, and while it’s likely aimed at the younger gamers in your household, with its original Switch blue and red livery, older gamers will find that this is a comfortable and surprisingly great-sounding headset.</p>


<p>I’ve been putting the Airlite Fit through its paces with the Switch 2, and as a 3.5mm wired headset, I’ve been able to pair it with the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. It’s an ideal match, and you’ll find that there’s heaps of volume to drown out any external sounds, despite the Airlite Fit’s relatively weak passive noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Airlite Fit lives up to its name by being exceedingly light. That’s thanks to the plastics used in the build, from the earcups through to the headband. There’s a serious amount of flex to the headset, and I worried about the sturdiness at first without any metal running through the centre. I didn’t need to worry, though, as you can twist it into all sorts of worrying shapes before it returns to its original shape. I don’t think it’s going to last as long as some headsets out there, but it’s solid enough to survive through regular play.</p>


<p>There’s then memory foam padding in the headband, and in the earpads, covered by soft jersey knit fabric, which helps to keep comfort levels good throughout extended play. The Airlite Fit does a decent job at this price point, but if you’re used to the finer things in life, or just a headset that’s a step or two up the price scale, then you’ll likely notice the slightly harsher plastics and fabric more keenly.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about the Airlite Fit is just how good they sound. Outfitted with well-tuned 40mm drivers, there’s a lot of Turtle Beach’s trademark bombast to the audio output, giving every encounter a huge amount of drama thanks to the enhanced bass. It doesn’t come at the cost of the top end though, and they outpace some far more expensive headsets and headphones.</p>
<p>Whether that’s been testing out massive RPG hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma</a> or the new Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, or diving into multiplayer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, gaming sounds great with the Airlite Fit in tow, and there’s a lot to be said for the ease of plugging in a wired headset, and using its single volume wheel control.</p>

<p>That continues into other media, and listening to music, especially rock, metal and rap, really benefit from the tuning of the Airlite Fit. There’s not quite the detail you’ll find in more expensive or specialised headsets, but there’s drama and depth, with tracks like Bad Omen’s The Death of Peace of Mind, or Fort Minor’s Where’d You Go sounding absolutely great.</p>
<p>Thanks to its recent update, I’ve played a heap of Splatoon 3, with the added bonus of Switch 2’s onboard Gamechat functionality finally bringing Nintendo fully into the modern multiplayer age. The noise-cancelling mic is another high point for the Airlite Fit, with a flip-to-mute adjustable mic arm that sits exactly where you put it, with loads of adjustability. If you don’t want to use it, it sits well out of the way, but it’s exactly where you need it when it’s time to shout at your friends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alongside a single player career mode reveal, Straight4 Studios has confirmed that Project Motor Racing will launch on 24th November across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO (and controversially outspoken figurehead) Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>
<p>The career mode aims to provide a realistic take on motorsports careers, featuring over 70 vehicles from 10 different racing classes, going from 1970s sports cars through to modern GT3s and LMDh hypercars, and it will have 27 scanned real world tracks.</p>
<p>The career mode, as detailed in the trailer, looks fascinating. Instead of something akin to Gran Turismo where you take winnings, earn trophy cars and build a garage, the career gives you a starting point of your choice, and then challenges you to succeed and progress through financial earnings and smart moves. It’s not all about winning, but it is about your winnings.</p>

<p>You’ll have one of three financial backstories, set a location for your team – which affects entry fees and competitions available – and then choose financial backing through sponsors. There’s no car unlocks or levelling up needed for the top tier of racing, outside of simply needing to be able to afford them. Of course, higher and more generous sponsorship models (which could cover travel fees separately from base pay and performance bonuses) will come with higher demands, and if you can’t meet them, you could be out on your ear pretty quickly. Crashes and damage will also have an impact, as that cost comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>It’s another interesting take on the concept, similar to how Project CARS let you start at any racing category, and will be fascinating to see how the financing is tuned and balanced in the game.</p>
<p>Of course PMR will also have a full suite of online multiplayer racing, focusing on more sim-minded gamers with features like full race weekends to test yourself again.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on for sim-racing fans and those looking for a fresh alternative to the more established examples of the genre.</p>
