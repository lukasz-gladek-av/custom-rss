		<p>On 8th May, Paradox Interactive will reveal their next grand strategy game, dubbed Project Caesar. The reveal will take place at 5PM UK time, 6PM CEST, 12PM ET, 9AM PT, and can be watched here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is being created at Studio Tinto, Paradox’s Barcelona-based team that was founded back in 2020 and put under the direction of studio lead Johan Andersson, who’s had an integral role in leading development of many of Paradox’s biggest games through the eras.</p>
<p>Paradox has been lightly previewing the game in a series of Tinto Talks developer diaries, drawing in community feedback on feature ideas, game systems and historical research. Now it’s time to completely unfurl what Project Caesar will be.</p>

<p>So, what will Project Caesar be? Will be it be an original franchise or a sequel to one of Paradox’s main pillars? Being Project Caesar could refer to a Roman period game – last explored by Paradox in 2019’s Imperator: Rome – but that would probably be a bit on the nose. Meanwhile, Hearts of Iron IV is now 9 years old and Europa Universalis IV is coming up on its 12th anniversary.</p>

		<p>It’s not been a great week out in game journalist land, and our thoughts are with the staff at Polygon and Giant Bomb as they work out what might come next. Here at TSA, we’ve continued to play games, and I’ve been getting into Revenge of the Savage Planet, making a start on the extra-terrestrial adventure with a little help from Tef. Alongside that, I’ve continued to play Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which has become my chill-out game, alongside a batch of other things including Mycopunk and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/unbeatable-is-a-rhythm-action-narrative-adventure-thats-creating-its-own-genre/">Unbeatable</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> was so early with his WWP, that I forgot to ask everyone else, but he says that, “Following a brief spell in Cyrodiil (I intend to return to Oblivion Remastered in the very near future, mind) I once again picked up my Tantō and Kanabō to finish off Assassin’s Creed Shadows. My impressions remain very much the same though unlocking a few late game abilities and gear perks definitely made combat more interesting. A couple of soft twists kept the story enticing enough for me to see it through, but the ending is somewhat abrupt and predictably open-ended, giving Ubisoft ample opportunity for new storylines and expansions.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Of course. He’s not the only one sticking with his gaming happy place though as <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing The Witcher 3 where he’s once again near the end of the main quest. Then he’ll just have Blood &amp; Wine to go. That’s not all though, telling us, “I’ve also started a playthrough of Tell Me Why. Finished the first chapter and I’m intrigued to see what happens next.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued to play through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which he says, “is excellent and also taking ages for me to finish for some reason.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has kept things interesting by playing loads of random things! He told us, “Some Bayonetta 2, Mark of the Ninja (probably the best stealth game I’ve every played), a spot of AC Shadows, a little Atomfall, and also two roguelites for review; Kiborg and Spiritfall – phew!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also had a week made up of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, telling us, “I’ve just finished the first act and it made me feel things.” He continues, “I’ve also spent some time with a couple of indies which should be reviewed for early next week. Finally I’ve now completed all the galaxy challenges in Lego Skywalker and just have the film levels to 100% but my eldest wants to multiplay those so trying to organise the time to do that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been and needed a co-op buddy this week, first with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/mycopunk-preview-a-co-op-shooter-for-all-you-fun-guys-out-there/">preview impressions of Mycopunk’s demo</a>, and later with a good dose of Revenge of the Savage Planet. He also shared some hands on thoughts about the modern wargaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow.</a></p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

		<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>


<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>
