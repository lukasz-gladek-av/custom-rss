		<p>A pair of behind the scenes videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, the delightful, hand-crafted co-op platformer from Kong Orange, WiredFly and Epic Games Publishing.</p>
<p>Out of Words stars Kurt and Karla, whose mouths have disappeared and need to adventure through the colourful world of Vokabulantis. A story about the first time they ever held hands, it’s a game to be played in co-op, whether locally or online.</p>


<p>However, not everyone is without a mouth, and they have a teasing older brother-like figure in the form of the rather mocking Prince.</p>
<p>The first of two videos sees Art Director Mikkel discussing how the character was designed, from how extravagant he is to some of the back and forth about visual details.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet a Real Stop Motion Prince | Out of Words Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9k2v5flAmUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second goes further into the actual craftsmanship that goes into this game, with&nbsp;Senior Fabricator Sofie Kjær walking us through how the puppet is created, sculpting different expressions, hand positions, and painting the models to conjure the character into stop motion life.</p>

<p>It’s all really rather lovely looking. Out of Words is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> &amp; PC via Epic Games Store in 2026.</p>

		<p>It’s been an unexpectedly hectic week for me away from the video game shenanigans, but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been plenty of gaming in my life still. While this week’s biggest hitters have been put into other people’s hands, as you’ll see below, I’ve had one of next week’s biggest games on the go. I’m keeping that particular card close to my chest for now, but I’ve also had some enjoyably silly times in some tactical shooters, checking out Rainbow 6 Mobile’s launch and chatting to one of the developers, and also jumping into Rogue Point for some lighter, more arcade tactical shooter-ing with Miguel as my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued to dig through his backlog and has been playing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. “I’ve only just got to Hawaii” he says, which makes it sound like he’s following Ichiban’s story in real life…. before continuing “and I’m waiting for the game to open up so I can truly go exploring.”</p>

<p>There’s a big new horror game in town with Resident Evil Requiem and so <strong>Nic</strong> has been playing…. Resident Evil Village. But Steve? <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-review/">Requiem for our review</a> and he’s loved it! He’s started on the speed runs for it, while also checking out the Switch 2 port of Resident Evil 7… and still has found time to return to Breath of Fire 3 for some retro gaming, has the Legacy of Kain: Defiance remaster downloading, and has even snuck in some Steam Next Fest demos! Absolute mad lad.</p>
<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> been playing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War: Sons of Sparta</a>, but he’s not quite sure if he like it. Based on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-review/">Gamoc’s re-review</a>, though, he’s grabbed Echoes of the End in the sale and found that it’s really enjoyable. “It’s the kind of linear third-person action adventure that I absolutely love, but just doesn’t seem to get made much any more. Not an open world, soul, or rogue in sight, and I love it!”</p>


<p>Continuing to wrap himself up in the Wild West of Red Dead Redemption, <strong>Jim</strong> has just about finished the last few story missions, and has now passed through the veil and starting the Undead Nightmare expansion. “It’s a fun reframing of Rockstars open-world cowboy sim and – by 2010 standards – a rather meaty expansion that still has plenty of satirical humour.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuff</strong> has dipped into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> for the Server Slam, but says it “Seems a bit.. empty? Also very odd your team mates can extract without you.” He was abandoned by his fellows after just 15 minutes! Expect more in-depth thoughts on this soon, especially with the full release next week.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s juggled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review-a-stunning-port/">Resident Evil Requiem and its impressive Switch 2 release</a>, Overwatch, where he’s very happy that they’ve ditched the ‘2’, and Monster Hunter Stories 3 for review next week. That’s been most of it, but he’s also had a little bit of Lumines Arise, and made a wee start on Fallout 4’s Switch 2 port. How has that fared?</p>
<p><em>That’s us, but what about you? What have you all been playing?</em></p>
