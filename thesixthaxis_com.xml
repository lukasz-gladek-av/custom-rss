		<p>Focus Entertainment and developer Hutlihut Games have announced that their co-op space action game Void Crew is coming out for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on 4th September 2025.</p>
<p>New console players will join the existing PC-based community, which grew through early access and the full game’s launch back in November 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Console Release Date Trailer [Void Crew]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcwJCbd_PQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Void Crew sneds you off into the depths of METEM space to fight back against the HOLLOW alien enemy that is invading. With crews of 1-6 players, you will take on specific roles within the ship as Pilot, Gunner, Engineer, and Scavenger, running around the 3D environment to man stations, perform tasks and generally work together to try and push back the enemy. There will be job like hopping onto cannons, of course, but also planning out your moves at a shared table, going on space walks to patch up the hull, making internal repairs, flipping internal controls, and more.</p>
<p>As you progress from objective to objective, you’ll expand your ship’s loadout, taking the opportunity to customise and upgrade your ship, hopefully improving your survivability for when you wind up in space battles with swarms of enemies and huge bosses. It’s a roguelite, though, so expect to fail a good few times and have to start all over from the beginning.</p>
