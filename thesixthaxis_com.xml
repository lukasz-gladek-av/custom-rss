		<p>The traditional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-sale">Steam Autumn Sale</a> is now on, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales bonanza that everyone is throwing right about now, and there’s thousands of games now on offer with discounts from a token 10% off through to huge 90% off firesales.</p>
<p>You can just<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"> head to Steam</a> and see what they proffer up on the homepage for you, but you’d absolutely be forgiven for finding the offerings quite underwhelming. A decade ago we might be able to grab games that were barely a month or two old for £20, but now in 2024 the starting RRP of big budget games is higher, and it feels like publishers are staying fairly constrained with their percentage discounts for games that are less than five years old now.</p>


<p>That means you’ve got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?snr=1_4_660__629">Space Marine 2 only dropping to £44 (a 20% saving)</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/?snr=1_4_660__629">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?snr=1_4_660__629">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> doing the same to £40, and even though <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?snr=1_4_660__629">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has chopped 25% off the price, that’s still £45. Still, Metaphor is barely a month old, and it’s one of the hottest games out there.</p>
<p>but there are plenty of bargains to be found on Steam, if you know where to look. Valve prominently highlights <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/special_deals">a selection of Deep Discounts</a> many of which are 90% off and include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">AC Odyssey for £5</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Fallen_Order?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Jedi: Fallen Order for £3.50</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Kingdom Come Deliverance for £2.64</a>. There’s also preset categories for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut1&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £7</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut2&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £4</a>, though you can just use the handy price slider for yourself.</p>
