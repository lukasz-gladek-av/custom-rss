		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3’s</a> release set for October, Frontier has started to reveal some of the major new gameplay ideas and, even more exciting, the new species that are coming to the game. Introducing the Lokiceratops:</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Lokiceratops | Dinosaur Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkCPulJqhT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yes, the Lokiceratops was named after the Norse god Loki, but not (just?) because of how handsome Tom Hiddlestone was around the time this dinosaur species was discovered in 2019 – first found in northern Montana. No, it’s actually down to the distinctive horns that they have around their frill.</p>
<p>There’s certainly some similarities to the Triceratops, you might say, and just as with that iconic dionsaur, this late cretaceous species is a herbivore. They can live together in small groups along with herbivores and ceratopsids, teaming up to defend their young from any threats.</p>
<p>In Jurassic World Evolution 3, you’ll have to care for Lokiceratops in family units, ensuring that they have nests and have privacy to allow for breeding to take place between male and female dinos – none of this frog DNA to mess around with anymore. They’ll also just need plenty of space and vegetation to feel comfortable, so the ogling hordes shouldn’t get too close regardless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/jurassic-world-evolution-3-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches 21 October 2025</a> across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We’re four years removed from the last game in the series, which we award a stonking (stomping?) 9/10.</p>
<p>“Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original’s rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you’re a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn’t love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.”</p>
