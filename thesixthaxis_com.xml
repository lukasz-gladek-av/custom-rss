		<p>Amazon Game Studio has announced that it will be shutting down the servers of the co-op platformer King of Meat, six months after it launched. King of Meat released on October 2nd and its servers will be switched off on April 9th. It has been removed from sale with immediate effect, so if you were curious to give it a try you won’t be able to now unless you already bought it.</p>

<p>In a statement, Amazon Game Studio wrote, <em>“Following the launch of King of Meat, it’s been incredibly rewarding to watch the community enjoy this fun and chaotic world. <wbr>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.</em></p>
<p><em><wbr>All players who purchased King of Meat will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider.<wbr>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We’re grateful for Glowmade’ s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.”</em></p>

<p>If you do own King of Meat you can no longer buy Stamps in the game. The game will receive no further updates regarding content or bug fixes. In regard to refunds, they will be handled directly by the platform holders, and they should be automatically done between 24th February and 9th April. If a refund is not received by April 9th, players have been told to contact customer support for the platform that they own King of Meat on.</p>
