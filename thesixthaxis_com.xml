		<p>Firaxis has announced that it is now rolling out update 1.3.0 for Civilization VII, and this update primarily focuses on the sea and oceans. It includes the new Harbor building unit, the Privateer unit for all civilisations, changes to naval combat, and more resources in the ocean. Alongside this, the Tides of Power Collection is available to download for free until January 5th, giving access to Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga today, and while in December players will be able to get the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game.</p>

<p><b>Gameplay</b></p>
<p><b>Buildings &amp; Units</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Building: Harbor</b>
<ul>
<li>The Harbor is an Antiquity Age Warehouse Water Building available to all civs that unlocks on Sailing.
<ul>
<li>As a Water Building, it can be placed only in Coastal and Navigable River tiles. It has the same placement restrictions as a Fishing Quay.</li>
<li>Like other Warehouse Buildings, the Harbor is available in Towns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It provides +1 base Production, and a +1 Production Warehouse bonus on Fishing Boats.</li>
<li>Naval Units will default to spawning on the Harbor, similar to the Barracks for land Units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Unit: Privateer</b>
<ul>
<li>The Privateer is an Exploration Age Light Naval Unit available to all civs that unlocks on Heraldry. It is a melee-focused Unit, with very weak ranged and bombard attacks.</li>
<li>The Privateer has the Pirate ability (see below for details). Additionally, when the Privateer kills a Unit, it gains 100% of its Combat Strength as Gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Unit Ability: Pirate</b>
<ul>
<li>The Pirate ability allows the following:
<ul>
<li>Units can cross borders of other civs without Open Borders, Alliance, or War.</li>
<li>Units can Plunder Trade Routes between non-Allied civs without War.
<ul>
<li>Plundering a Trade Route this way causes a slight reduction in Relationship with the civ the Trader belonged to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Units can attack non-Allied Units without War.
<ul>
<li>Defeating a Unit this way causes a slight reduction in Relationship with the civ the Unit belonged to. Attacking an Independent Power this way causes them to become Hostile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b>AI</b></p>
<ul>
<li>AI now fully uses all Sanctions against other players, including other AI players.</li>
<li>When an AI proposal to form an alliance is accepted, the alliance is now properly created between the two leaders.</li>
<li>AI no longer fails to use the Establish Air Base Ability when progressing through a game in the Modern Age.</li>
<li>AI no longer fails to attack Air Bases with Air Units when establishing an Air Base near the AI’s Settlement during Modern Age Gameplay.</li>
<li>AI now more consistently builds naval Units.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where AI would not properly select Celebrations.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where AI players could still receive free walls in multiple Settlements when a custom difficulty game sets free walls to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Combat</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(★ – Community Influenced Item)&nbsp;<b>Naval Combat Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>The Cog (Exploration Unit) now has a range of 2, increased from 1.</li>
<li>Light and Heavy Naval Units are more distinct. This applies to both Exploration and Modern.
<ul>
<li>Light Naval Units are now primarily melee Units with very weak ranged and bombard strength. They have increased movement and sight compared to the Heavy Naval Units in their Age, and can benefit from flanking when attacking. Light Units take reciprocal damage when attacking.
<ul>
<li>The new Privateer Unit in Exploration is a Light Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Light Naval Units in Modern have had their ranged and bombard strength reduced by 20 to better fit their role as melee Units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heavy Naval Units are now primarily ranged Units. Their melee strength has been reduced by 5, and their ranged and bombard strength have increased by 5. Like other ranged Units, Heavy Units don’t take reciprocal damage when attacking.</li>
<li>Civ Unique Naval Units have been adjusted to keep their relative strength compared to the Unit they replaced in that Age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submarines (Modern Unit) are now ranged Units with an increased ranged strength of 70 and a reduced melee strength of 50. Previously they had a base strength of 65. They can no longer attack Districts or land Units.</li>
<li>The Fleet Commander’s Focus Fire and Coordinated Attack should now utilize Heavy and Light Units respectively. Light Naval Units should not be included in a Focus Fire, and Heavy Naval Units should not be included in a Coordinated Attack.
<ul>
<li>Privateers and Units with the Pirate ability will not participate in a Coordinated Attack or Focus Fire command while not at war.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note</b>: We made this decision to keep combat rules consistent and prevent bigger issues with how wars are handled. We’ll keep listening to feedback on this for future improvements!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Other Combat Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>Trench Fighters and Dive Bomber Units have had their Bombard Strength reduced, and Bomber and Heavy Bomber Units have had their Ranged Strengths reduced, to make the air Units fit better into their intended roles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Terrain: Atolls and Lotus</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Atolls:&nbsp;</b>Atolls are a Feature that can appear on Ocean tiles. They stop movement for Units, and have a combat defense bonus for Units on the Atoll. Their Yields when worked are:
<ul>
<li><b>Exploration:</b>&nbsp;1 Food, 2 Production, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Modern:</b>&nbsp;1 Food, 2 Production, 2 Culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Lotus:</b>&nbsp;Lotus is a Feature that can appear on Lake tiles. They replace Reef tiles that previously appeared in Lakes. Their Yields when worked are:
<ul>
<li><b>Antiquity</b>: 1 Food, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Exploration</b>: 2 Food, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Modern</b>: 2 Food, 2 Culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Terrain Updates</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Reefs:</b>&nbsp;Reefs no longer spawn in Lakes. They are now exclusively in Coastal tiles that are not Lakes. Their Yields when worked have been updated:
<ul>
<li><b>Antiquity</b>: 1 Food, 1 Production, 1 Science</li>
<li><b>Exploration</b>: 1 Food, 2 Production, 1 Science</li>
<li><b>Modern</b>: 1 Food, 2 Production, 2 Science</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Ocean:</b>&nbsp;Ocean tiles are now workable by all civs in the Modern Age and provide 1 Food and 3 Gold.</li>
<li><b>Grand Canyon:</b>&nbsp;The Grand Canyon now gives 1 Science on Flat tiles, from 2 previously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(★)&nbsp;<b>Auto Explore and Discoveries</b>
<ul>
<li>When clicking on Units with Auto Explore, Discoveries are now highlighted in blue to improve readability.</li>
<li>The automated exploration ability can no longer be activated when the Unit is within range of being able to reach a discovery (within 2 turns of movement).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Economy</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thành Huế no longer requires Flat terrain.</li>
<li>Sawmill no longer requires River placement.</li>
<li>Trade Route Range is no longer ignored when Forming an Alliance with the Kolp’um Civic researched as Silla during Antiquity Age.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Independent Powers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Independent Powers no longer spawn more Units than expected when performing Incite Raid in early Antiquity.</li>
<li>Festival Ground now specifies that it needs to be placed on an existing improvement in the choose bonus menu.</li>
<li>Independent Power Carracks no longer receive Rough Seas damage when they move into Open Ocean tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Modern Social Policy, Monopolies, to provide +5 Gold in Settlements with a Factory. (<i>Previously: +3)</i></li>
<li>Updated Dell’Arte della Guerra Memento to provide +3 Gold per Sanction you have active per Age. (<i>Previously: +5 Gold per Sanction you have active per Age.)</i></li>
<li>Made improvements to the first-time user experience for Unique Buildings.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the player could be prevented from interacting with their Founder when putting the Founder to sleep while Auto End turn is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Military</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(★) Commanders no longer consume all movement points when deploying all Units.</li>
<li>Splash damage reduced from 50% to 25% on Fleet and Squadron Trees.</li>
<li>Commander’s Coordinated attack no longer fails to work when individually unpacking with ‘Initiative’.</li>
<li>Commander Units in process of respawning no longer appear as an available choice when opening the “Levy Unit” menu from a Suzerain City-State.</li>
<li>Ottru Units no longer fail to receive any active Naval Unit bonuses.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Resources&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Updated Resource Generation:</b>
<ul>
<li>(★) Resources should be more consistent between Ages now. If a resource is not generated in an Age, it will not appear suddenly in future Ages, nor will it disappear for an Age and then come back. For example, if you didn’t see Turtles in Antiquity, they will not appear in Exploration.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>We’ve gotten feedback that changing resources between Ages can be frustrating. While we like that the world changes a little between Ages and makes you reevaluate the map, this was a good spot to improve the experience and address some of the feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maps will now have a guaranteed minimum of 3 different Coastal Resources, with a chance for more.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;This should make those hidden Whales start appearing in more games!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Age Transitioning, maps will now have at least 1 new Resource introduced in that Age. For example, transitioning to Exploration would guarantee at least one Resource new to Exploration, like Whales, Niter, or the new Pitch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Resources:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Crabs</b>: Appears on Coastal and Lake tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Food</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +2 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +3 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Cowrie:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Coastal tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Happiness</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +4 Gold in Cities, +2 Science in Towns</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +5 Gold in Cities, +3 Science in Towns</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +6 Gold in Cities, +4 Science in Towns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Turtles:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Coastal tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Culture on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +2 Culture on Warehouse Buildings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Pitch:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Vegetated tiles in Grassland, Plains, and Tundra.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Production, +1 Gold</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Gold on Water Buildings</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Production on Factories, +10% Production towards constructing Factories in all Settlements when slotted.</li>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;With Pitch, we’re experimenting with new design space for Resources. The Resource is harder to use, requiring specific Buildings and may not be active until late in an Age, but its tile has increased Yield compared to other Resources. Let us know what you think!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Leaders &amp; Civs</b></h2>
<h2>Civs</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Achaemenid Persia</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Persia is a beloved civ, but we got enough feedback that they felt weak in areas outside of combat that we wanted to buff them. Now, they have increased Culture from their Unique Improvements, as well as a little more healing. Finally, we renamed them to better clarify their identity as the Achaemenids.</li>
<li><b>Pairidaeza</b>: +2 Culture and +1 Gold. +5 Healing for Military Units in a Settlement with a Pairidaeza. Cannot be adjacent to another Pairidaeza.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Culture and Gold. Cannot be adjacent to another Pairidaeza.)</i></li>
<li><b>Satrapies (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Settlement Limit. The Pairidaeza gets +1 Culture and +1 Happiness from adjacent Quarters.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Settlement Limit. The Pairidaeza gets +1 Happiness from adjacent Quarters.)</i></li>
<li><b>Baziš (Tier 1)</b>: +5 Gold, +2 Happiness and +2 Culture for every different civilization you have captured a Settlement from.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Achaemenid Empire: +5 Gold for every different civilization you have captured a Settlement from.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Aksum</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Aksum’s changes are a good example of our new approach of giving stronger bonuses on narrower effects. By leaning into the emphasis on Coastal Settlements, we get to buff the numbers of some of the abilities. Remember, a Coastal Settlement is a Settlement with its City Center adjacent to the Coast.</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: +3 Gold on Resources in Coastal Settlements.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +2 Gold on Resources.)</i></li>
<li><b>Tankwa</b>: Added +2 Gold from this Trade Route.</li>
<li><b>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Gold on Districts adjacent to Coast. Port of Nations Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Gold on Quarters adjacent to Coast. Port of Nations Tradition.)</i></li>
<li><b>Monumentum Adulitanum (Tier 1)</b>: Culture and Happiness Buildings gain a +1 Culture Adjacency for Hawilti&nbsp;<i>(Previously: The Altar and Monument gain a Culture Adjacency with Hawilti.)</i></li>
<li><b>Book of the Himyarites</b>&nbsp;<b>(Tier 1)</b>: Gain a free Merchant. The Dhow gets +1 Movement and ignores Zone of Control. May This Please the People Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: The Dhow gets the Swift keyword (ignore ZoC). May This Please the People Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Chola</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>Chola only needed a little reinforcement of its identity as a Diplomatic civ, so we added some Influence generation to their kit.</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: Added +3 Gold and +1 Influence on Trade Routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Egypt</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;We got a lot of feedback that Egypt offered an exciting gameplay style (focusing on Wonders) but often failed to deliver, or was rough to transition into Exploration and onward. We leaned heavily into the Desert and Navigable River theme, and gave Egypt some hefty buffs.</li>
<li><b>Gifts of Osiris</b>: +2 Production on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Gifts of Osiris: +1 Production on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Riches of the Duat</b>: +15% Production towards Wonders, doubled for Wonders in Desert Terrain. +2 Production on Wonders in Desert Terrain.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +15% Production towards Wonders.)</i></li>
<li><b>Mastaba</b>: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles and Navigable Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles.)</i></li>
<li><b>Mortuary Temple</b>: Gold base. +1 Happiness adjacency for Navigable Rivers. +1 Culture Adjacency for Wonders.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles and Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Light of Amun-Ra (Tier 1)</b>: +2 Gold and +2 Culture on the Palace and Wonders. +1 Settlement Limit. Kemet Tradition. Pyramids Wonder.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +5 Gold on the Palace. +1 Settlement Limit. Kemet Tradition. Pyramids Wonder.)</i></li>
<li><b>Akhet</b>: +2 Food on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.<i>&nbsp;(Previously: +1 Food on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Kemet</b>: +1 Culture on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Culture on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Great Britain:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;We tried to limit the nerfs in this pass to individual effects that were overperforming. With the increased use of Towns and more Warehouses available, this effect had to change.</li>
<li><b>East India Company</b>: +5 Gold in Towns. (<i>Previously: +3 Gold on each Building in Towns.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Hawai’i:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: Can work Ocean tiles. Ocean tiles have 1 Food and 2 Gold. Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to Marine Terrain. +1 Happiness on all Marine Terrain. (<i>Previously: Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to a Marine Tile. +1 Happiness on Fishing Boats.)</i></li>
<li><b>Leiomano</b>:<b>&nbsp;</b>+5 defense against Heavy Naval Units.</li>
<li><b>Lo’I Kalo</b>: +3 Food. +2 Production. Receives +1 Culture from each adjacent Fishing Boat. Can only be placed in the Grassland and Tropical Biomes. (<i>Previously: Lo’I Kalo: +3 Food. +2 Production. Adjacent Farms receive +1 Culture. Can only be placed in the Grassland and Tropical Biomes.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Maya</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Rain of Chaac (Tier 1)</b>: Unlock the K’uh Nah. The Altar gains +2 Science if placed on a Vegetated Tile. Pet Kot Tradition. (<i>Previously: Unlock the K’uh Nah. The Altar gains +1 Science Adjacency for Vegetated tiles. Pet Kot Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mississippian</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Like the change to Great Britain, we had to make some tweaks to what was probably the strongest Tradition in the game.</li>
<li><b>Shell-Tempered Pottery</b>: Food, Gold, and Warehouse Buildings gain a +1 Gold Adjacency for Resources.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Buildings gain a +1 Gold Adjacency for Resources.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Prussia</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Ruhr (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Science on Resources. Coking Tradition. (<i>Previously +2 Science on Resources. Coking Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Qing</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Kang Qian Shèngshì:</b>&nbsp;+4 Gold, +4 Culture, +2 Influence, but -4 Science per Trade Route. (<i>Previously: +4 Gold, +3 Culture, +2 Influence, but -1 Science from Imported Resources.)</i></li>
<li><b>Open Customs (Tier 1)</b>: Unlock the Qianzhuang. +1 Culture for every imported Resource. Cohong Tradition. +1 Settlement Limit. (<i>Previously: +2 Culture for every imported Resource. Cohong Tradition. +1 Settlement Limit.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Songhai</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>Songhai, like Egypt, was a civ that promised a cool gameplay niche (Navigable Rivers and Homelands Treasure) but fell short of exciting in a few ways. We made a lot of adjustments to their kit to improve their gameplay throughout the Age.</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: Added +1 Production in Cities on Navigable Rivers for every Resource assigned to them. Removed +3 Gold for every active Trade Route.</li>
<li><b>Ships of the Desert (Tier 2):</b>&nbsp;+1 Production on the Caravanserai in Settlements with a Bazaar and in Mining Towns and Trade Outposts. Unlocks the Mud Brick Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +2 Gold on the Caravanserai in Settlements with a Bazaar. Receive the Mud Brick Tradition.)</i></li>
<li><b>Hi-Koi (Tier 1):</b>&nbsp;Minor and Navigable Rivers do not end Unit Movement. Your Trade Ships cannot be plundered on Navigable Rivers. (<i>Previously: +5 combat strength to all combat Units on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Hi-Koi</b>&nbsp;<b>(Tier 2):</b>&nbsp;Fleet Commanders gain the Convoys Promotion for free. Unlocks the Isa Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Isa Tradition and Rivers do not end movement.)</i></li>
<li><b>Kanta (Tier 1)</b>: Cities in Homelands on Navigable Rivers generate Treasure Convoys worth 1 VP each. Tajiro’s Gold becomes 200. Unlocks the Wakia Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Cities in Homelands on Navigable Rivers generate Treasure Ships worth 1 VP each. Tajiro’s Gold becomes 200. +1 Settlement Cap.)</i></li>
<li><b>Kanta (Tier 2):</b>&nbsp;+5 Combat Strength for the Gold Bangles Infantry with at least 5 Resources slotted in the Capital. +1 Settlement Limit.</li>
<li><b>Timbuktu:</b>&nbsp;+2 Gold on Rough Terrain and Mines on Resources if there is a Gold Building in that City.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +2 Gold on Mines if there is a Gold Building in that City.)</i></li>
<li><b>Mud Brick:</b>&nbsp;Added +1 Gold and Production on Gold Buildings on Desert or Plains.</li>
<li><b>Isa:</b>&nbsp;+5 Combat Strength and +2 Movement to all Units on Navigable Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +2 Movement to all Units on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Wakia&nbsp;</b>(New Tradition): +3 Gold for every active Trade Route.</li>
<li><b>Caravanserai Improvement</b>: Added +1 Land Trade Route Range. Cannot be built adjacent to another Caravanserai.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Spain</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Spain got a significant pass to help fit its historical and gameplay identity as conquerors of Distant Lands, and should feel much better in Exploration.</li>
<li>Attributes changed to Economic and Militaristic. (<i>Previously: Expansionist and Militaristic.)</i></li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: +2 Food, Gold, and Production in Settlements adjacent to Coast and in Settlements following your own Religion, or +4 if it is both. This is doubled in Distant Lands. (<i>Previously: +15% Gold towards converting a Town to a City, or 30% in Distant Lands.)</i></li>
<li><b>Armada (Tier 2):</b>&nbsp;now has +5 combat strength for Heavy Naval Units.</li>
<li><b>Council of the Indies (Tier 1)</b>: gained “+15% Gold towards converting a Town to a City, or 30% in Distant Lands.”</li>
<li><b>Council of the Indies (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Settlement Limit. Unlocks the El Escorial Wonder.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Movement for Treasure Convoys and Rough Terrain does not end their Movement.)</i></li>
<li><b>New World Riches (Tier 1)</b>: +10% Food and Production in Cities in Distant Lands.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +10% Food and Production in Settlements in Distant Lands.)</i></li>
<li><b>New World Riches (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Movement for Treasure Convoys and Rough Terrain does not end their Movement. Rough Terrain effect now also applies to Conquistadors.<i>&nbsp;(Previously: +1 Settlement Limit. Unlocks the El Escorial Wonder.)</i></li>

<h2><b>Content Collection</b></h2>
<h2>Leaders</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</b></p>

<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</b>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><b>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</b>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Civilizations</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</b></p>

<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune… and came with few scruples.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</b>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations’ Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations’ borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><b>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</b>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the ‘Raiding Party’ Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><b>Action – Raiding Party</b>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</b>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations’ borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><b>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</b>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</b></p>

<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</b>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><b>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</b>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><b>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</b>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wonders</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</b>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Nan Madol – Exploration</b>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</b>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mapu’a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</b>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Warhammer Survivors is the new game from Auroch Digital, which has previously developed Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun and is working on Boltgun 2. Warhammer Survivors is less Boltgun and more Vampire Survivors in style, and that isn’t a surprise since Auroch Digital has partnered up with poncle and is using their game engine. Warhammer Survivors is an official Survivors game, but standalone and dripping in Warhammer action and lore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer Survivors Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You can really see the common ground between Vampire Survivors and this game, from the style of the pixel art to the pace of movement and the way that upgrades are dropped in boxes.</p>
<p>Players will be able to upgrade weapons and abilities so each run can last longer. Some of those weapons are the Boltgun, the Astartes Chainsword, and the Whirlwind Axes. Auroch Digital has also announced some of the playable characters for Warhammer Survivors including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Malum Caedo<wbr></li>
<li>Kozlowski&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Brother Luca&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<wbr><b>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Neave Blacktalon,</li>
<li>Sharynn Azurwath<wbr></li>
<li>Gotrek Gurnisson<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>These characters and others will be tasked with fighting Skaven and Tyranid swarms.&nbsp; Warhammer Survivors is due to be released in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p>
