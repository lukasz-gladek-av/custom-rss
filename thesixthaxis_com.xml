		<p>Capcom has released a new gameplay trailer for Fatal Fury’s Mai, who is part of Street Fighter VI’s Year 2 Character Pass. The trailer shows her facing off against Chun Li and Ryu in two different bouts, wearing two different outfits, both from her Fatal Fury wardrobe. Mai has been part of the Fatal Fury series since Fatal Fury 2, which released back in 1992.</p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer, Mai brings her Shiranui Ninja style into the fighter mix of Street Fighter VI. It is a hand to hand style that also encompasses throws, kicks, elbows, fire, and paper fans. Players who like putting together combos will have plenty to work with when it comes to Mai’s fighting style, and it looks like it will favour those who prefer fast moving characters. Mai will be available from February 5th in Street Fighter VI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a>&nbsp;Nick said,&nbsp;<em>“Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</em></p>

		<p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/bandai-namco-will-publish-rebel-wolves-rpg-dawnwalker/">Bandai Namco and new studio Rebel Wolves</a> agreed a publishing deal for Rebel Wolves new RPG, at the time named Dawnwalker. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Today, the first cinematic and gameplay teaser for The Blood of Dawnwalker has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is set in Europe during the 14th century, with the Black Plague wiping out people at a high rate. One of the people affected is Lunka, the sister of main character Coen. In the trailer, you can see him fleeing a patrol to stop them from killing his sister and ending up in a ruined church. Cornered, Coen is saved by an unlikely source. That is a vampire and his allies. The vampire saves Lunka’s life, but has his own motivations to take advantage of humanity’s time of weakness to grab power and gain freedom, along with other creatures of the night.</p>
<p>While the cinematic ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, the trailer shows some gameplay with Coen wielding dark powers. Coen is the Daywalker, and the assumption is that the vampire made him this way as payment for saving Lunka. Coen has vampiric powers but can navigate the world during the day. As the story of The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp; progresses, players will make choices on whether to try and remain human or use the vampiric dark powers, moving further away from humanity. You will also be able to use a combo of human and vampire skills in combat, with all sorts of foes from soldiers to other monsters being enemies. Allies could be found among any group too, be they human or a creature of the night. It all depends on the decisions you make as Coen.</p>

<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker does not have a release date yet, and a gameplay reveal will be coming in the summer. The Blood of Dawnwalker has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
