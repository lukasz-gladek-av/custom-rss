		<p>Is it me, or is The Game Awards really good this year? It’s made all the better because one of the key announcements was the upcoming arrival of a brand new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. Seriously, if you lived on the Sega side of the street, you never needed to bother with Tekken, because Virtua Fighter was – to my mind anyway – vastly superior. The fact that it’s going to go up against the fantastic Tekken 8 means that 3D-fighting fans are really eating well right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW VIRTUA FIGHTER Project | World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmeGL2JP9N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer was a particularly teasy trailer, as it only gave us a few details. First amongst them was that it’s the Ryu Ga Gotoku studio that’s working on this new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. You might know them as the team behind the huge Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, and given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which in turn fed from Virtua Fighter, makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going at it in a sandy cityscape, with Akira sporting a new undercover look – that’s a fedora and trenchcoat if you were wondering – before then shifting perspective to point us towards an upcoming VF Direct where we’ll learn (hopefully) all the most important details.</p>
<p>Fans of the series – myself included – have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now, so I’m hoping that with the new title coming a few more people will hop in so I can practice poking them with Lion’s silly pointy fingers.</p>

<p>The VF Direct will take place on December 13th at 12am ET. Stay tuned for more as we have it</p>

		<p>The first of two big and bold game reveals, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, which seems to be a Like a Dragon game that takes us back to 1915 Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Century Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JanPitSWd94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Century is set in a particularly interesting point in time, both as newer technologies like record players filter into society, but also as more and more morsels of Western culture could filter through to Japan.</p>
<p>Of course, you know what was around back then? Gangs. Fisticuffs. Smoking. Looking cool.</p>

		<p>Wargaming has revealed Steel Hunters, their next big online multiplayer game, but instead of WW2 and Cold War tanks, boats and planes, this has got great bit forking mechs!</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game with undercurrents of hero shooters, battle royale and extraction shooter… but you’re in great big mechs that are definitely very reminiscent of Transformers and (for the cultured among us) Zoids.</p>
<p>With a full release expected next year, Wargaming are kicking off a reveal day playtest, which is available tonight from 12th until 22nd December. Join now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://steelhunters.com/">Steel Hunters website</a>.</p>

		<p>The Game Awards played host to the next game from genDesign, the studio of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ico">ICO</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-guardian">The Last Guardian</a> creator Fumito Ueda.</p>
<p><iframe title="genDESIGN Teaser for Latest Title | The Game Awards 2024 (English subtitles)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJHXe_9uhxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A game that is as yet unnamed, it seems to feature a lot of the tone and feel of Ueda’s work, though viewed through a sci-fi lens of sorts.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an ominous message to evacuate the region surrounding ground zero, and then a countdown before a cataclysmic event, there’s a rushed climb up a huge body, which leads to a giant mech head that, thankfully, manages to blast off and detach from its body before a brutal storm blows in.</p>
<p>That’s all we’ve got to go on right now, but it’s great to see that the minds behind some landmark games from the PS2 and PS3 are back to work on something equally distinctive.</p>
