			<p>The next big thing could be announced or revealed pretty much any day now, but there’s still a last few jobs to finish while the Nintendo Switch remains Nintendo’s latest and greatest. Among them is putting the final pieces of the puzzle in place for the Donkey Kong series, uniting the whole franchise on one platform. The early port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/04/nintendo-have-gone-the-extra-mile-for-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-on-switch/">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> was joined in 2020 by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/08/nintendo-switch-online-july-update-donkey-kong-immortal-natsune-wrestling/">the SNES trilogy on Nintendo Switch Online</a>, while the tail end of 2024 saw the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/donkey-kong-land-lands-on-nintendo-switch-online/">Game Boy’s Donkey Kong Land trilogy added</a>, and now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-returns-to-switch/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is putting the penultimate piece of the puzzle in place. Really, the only game left to reunite the whole simian platforming family on Switch is Donkey Kong 64.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/12/05/review-donkey-kong-country-returns/">Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best platformers of the Wii era</a>. The two Super Mario Galaxy games were exceptional, of course, but we were also a few years on from Nintendo’s return to side-scrollers with New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, jumping to Wii in 2009. Donkey Kong Country Returns was born out of Retro Studios’ love of Rare’s trilogy, looking to bring the same kind of ethos to a new generation, and it was a huge success.</p>


<p>DK and Diddy wake up one day to find their massive horde of bananas stolen by the Tiki Tak Tribe, the pair of them chase after them through the various distinct areas of Donkey Kong Island, from jungle to beach, from cliff faces to… a whole factory zone? It’s the fairly standard set-up with a clutch of levels within each area and you have to make a path through them (each area having multiple paths and an unlockable route) to a boss that’s been hypnotised and powered up by the Tiki Tak Tribe.</p>


<p>The platforming itself is inherently familiar, as you run and jump from left to right, though it has some DK-specific tweaks. Ground pounding can stun nearby enemies or interact with the world, some enemies need you to roll through them, and there’s a whimsical way that you can stop and blow at dandelion heads and propeller flowers to reveal their secrets.</p>
<p>And there’s tons of secrets. Almost all levels have the letters K-O-N-G to collect, and a bunch of puzzle pieces that are hidden behind scenery or in bonus areas. It will take a good deal of hunting to find them all, the rewards being some extra challenging levels, or things like gallery art, music and other extras.</p>
<p>Grab a DK barrel and Diddy can join in, hopping onto DK’s back to provide you with a second batch of hit points and boost your jumping with a jet pack. Alternatively, Diddy is player 2 in co-op, keeping that jet pack jump separate and having a pop gun in place of DK’s ground pound. This can actually lead to the game being quite a bit more challenging, since you don’t have both players with the expanded movement of Diddy’s jet pack.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns is renowned for being a challenging platformer, and that absolutely holds true. Though it’s moderately forgiving by giving you multiple hit points, and there’s usually a couple of checkpoints and lives are plentiful, the mine kart and rocket barrel levels are all insta-kill stages that can become quite frustrating through trial and error.</p>
<p>Everything brought to the game with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/17/quick-review-donkey-kong-country-returns-3d/">the Nintendo 3DS port</a> is brought forward to Nintendo Switch, so for the game difficulty you have a choice of “modern” mode with three hearts per ape and “original” mode with two, and you have more flexibility with buying things from Cranky Kong’s shop and equipping them in the inventory. Across both modes, multiple deaths eventually see you offered the help of Super Kong, which will have an AI play through the level for you, though you forego any of the things he collects.</p>

<p>Visually, this looks pretty much like you would expect it to. If you didn’t go back and look at comparisons, you’d happily assume that it’s just the game on Wii running at a higher resolution. The art direction absolutely holds up to this day – the silhouetted levels really stand out as a stylistic treat – though it does feel of its era in some ways and DK definitely isn’t as lusciously hairy as he is in Tropical Freeze. Curiously, catching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donkey+kong+country+returns+hd+comparison">a few comparison videos,</a> it does seem as though the Switch visuals are a tad more muted, with lighting highlights having a cooler tone to the more golden hues of the original. It’s a cleaner looks to the game, that’s for sure.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows that Nintendo like’s to take their time making games, but even by their standards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has been a long time coming. As it’s finally expected to release this year, it’s easily one of our most-anticipated games, not least because of the impending announcement and release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>…</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected, Nintendo taking the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series in the early 2000s with the original Metroid Prime on GameCube.</p>


<p>After 2019, Nintendo kept very, very quiet about Metroid Prime 4 until they were ready to do <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gameplay-has-been-revealed-its-coming-out-in-2025/">a whole new game announcement and reveal last June</a>. In the intervening years, there was the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023 to keep fans of the series engaged.</p>
<p>So, what can we expect from Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Well, the brief snippets of gameplay in last year’s re-reveal featured the classic Metroid Prime morph ball mode, locking onto enemies during combat, and spooky alien environments with a haunting synth-y soundtrack. Given that it’s now 17 years on from Metroid Prime 3’s release, it’s no surprise that the game looks significantly more expansive than what was possible on the Nintendo Wii, with some much larger environments and more dynamic AI running around and battling. There was a glimpse of returning antagonist and rival bounty hunter Sylux, who comes with Metroids in tow. Samus will have her bounty hunting hands full!</p>

<p>As exciting as Metroid Prime 4 is in its own right, perhaps what’s more intriguing about the game is how it can and will tie in with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. We’re publishing this Most Wanted on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">what is reportedly the eve of the Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement</a>, and given that there’s no release date for Metroid Prime 4 just yet, it’s easy to speculate that this will be a cross-gen release that makes the most of both Switch and Switch 2, taking on the role that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> had for the transition from Wii U to Switch.</p>
<p>That could be a pretty hefty burden to put on Samus Aran’s shoulders – Breath of the Wild had an attach rate of over 100% to the Switch in the early days of that console’s release – but the Switch 2’s launch will be rather different when Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility. There’s less pressure to be a must-buy exclusive because of that, and there’s as-yet-unconfirmed rumblings of some other more mainstream games, as well.</p>

		<p>The simulator genre is an unusual and ever-evolving array of experiences. Some might task you with specific or bespoke roles that people dream about, like becoming a paramedic or a train driver, while others let you become a car mechanic and dive into the nitty-gritty of how an engine works. Shine Research’s latest, with support from publisher Nacon sees you becoming an architect, with Architect Life: A House Design Simulator giving people the opportunity to build and design incredible homes without the lengthy or expensive university education. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Architect Life: A House Design Simulator | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXyH9aJs2qA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The official trailer immediately shows off the kind of builds that are going to be possible, aping ultra-modern or Grand Designs-styled properties with clarity. It’s clear that you’re going to be put to work by a range of clients, whose every wish you have to try and turn into a series of workable walls with a roof on top of them. It’s an intriguing set-up, and who knows, maybe you’ll find you have a taste for working in this field. Equally, you might discover that you hate people, but we’ll wait and see how needy these particular clients turn out to be.</p>
<p>It’s all very precise, with each section of the build displaying the kind of measurement details and iconography that you’d expect to see in a blueprint or architectural diagram. Don’t let that put you off though, as it seems as though the building itself looks very intuitive, at least with a keyboard and mouse in tow, though the team have been clear to say that it’s just as easy to control with a controller. Once you’ve built the building itself, you have to dress it as well, channelling your inner interior designer for maximum effect.</p>


<p>There’s two main modes, with a 60-mission campaign – that’s a lot of clients – and a sandbox mode where you can let your imagination run riot without constraints or someone breathing down your neck. Things can still go wrong though, and you have to also become a site manager, ensuring that the build continues on schedule despite inclement weather or supply delays.</p>
<p>Architect Life : A House Design Simulator will be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch in June 2025.</p>
