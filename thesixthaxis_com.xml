		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> is getting an upgrade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, free for existing PS4 and Xbox One owners, and that it’s out today.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance | Next-Gen Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0_5x0wEPDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The current gen upgrade for the original game comes as an anniversary treat for its sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which is celebrating having sold 5 million copies in the past year.</p>
<p>This could be a great way to draw more players into the game because, while Warhorse were keen to make sure that you didn’t&nbsp;<em>need</em> to have played the first to enjoy the story told in the second, there is always that compulsion amongst gamers to start at the very beginning, isn’t there?</p>
<p>Playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance on PS5 and Xbox Series will now mean enjoying the title at 60fps, helping to make the game more responsive on console than before. Additionally, visual fidelity has been enhanced with improved graphical features. This update has been made with assistance from Saber Interactive.</p>

<p>Warhorse CEO, Martin Frývaldský, said, “I’m&nbsp;incredibly proud to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reach this monumental milestone.&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to thank everyone at&nbsp;Warhorse Studios,&nbsp;our publishing partners at&nbsp;PLAION&nbsp;and of course, it&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;be possible without our amazing&nbsp;and ever&nbsp;growing&nbsp;community. Thank you for being&nbsp;part of this journey and making this a reality!”</p>
