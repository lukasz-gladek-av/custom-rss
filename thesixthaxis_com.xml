		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for July 2025, as well as detailing some of what will happen to mark and celebrate the 15th anniversary of the subscription service, which launched in a very different guise all the way back in 2010.</p>
<p>Let’s not mess about, though. PS Plus this month includes Diablo 4, and two other games, which are…</p>


<p><span>What are the PS Plus July 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>
<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/"><strong>Diablo IV</strong></a> is the headline act here, with Blizzard’s latest action RPG title looking to completely overhaul how it taps into online features, building more of a live game to compliment the moreish loot hunting. There’s been a bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/diablo-iv-season-of-loot-reborn-review/">seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">expansion</a> content added to the game since launch in 2023, but at the time Gamoc said, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/15/king-of-fighters-xv-15-review/"><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong></a> revived the long-running fighting game series, back in 2022. SNK’s storied series had gone pretty quiet through the previous decade, but came back with a hefty punch. Dom said in our review, “King of Fighters XV marks an excellent return for the series, modernising it at nearly every turn. While we await a story that’ll finally do justice to the characterful roster, it stakes a claim to SNK’s past with an eye firmly on the future.”</p>

<p>Alas, we have no review of Jusant to draw upon, but Don’t Nod’s climbing game was certainly fascinating to see developed and released. It’s both an action-puzzle climbing game where you try to clamber up the side of a huge tower, but it’s also a meditative journey because of this, with secrets from a lost civilisation to uncover.</p>
<h2>What’s happening for the PS Plus 15th Anniversary?</h2>
<p>Sony has pulled together a bunch of new game trials for PS Plus Premium members, some special offers, exclusive Valorant content, and PS Tournaments. Oh, and a free weekend!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-ps5-release-date-set-for-august/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II has a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> release date on 12th August, Ninja Theory and Xbox have confirmed. This enhanced release of the game is also coming as a free update to the game on Xbox Series X|S and PC at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOSjv1Nb1-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, how is it enhanced? Ninja Theory has outlined the new features that are coming to the game:</p>
<p>New features and upgrades included in the Enhanced release include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Mode</strong> – Where the original release was optimized for 30fps to deliver an immersive, cinematic experience, the Enhanced update will include a ‘Performance Mode’ to optimize for 60fps. On PC, the game will offer a “Very High’ preset to push fidelity even further based on personal hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Rot Mode</strong> – The Dark Rot from <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em> has returned and offers an additional challenge for Senua in this optional game mode. The Dark Rot will grow each time you fail, and if it reaches Senua’s head, her quest is over and all progress will be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Photo Mode</strong> – the Enhanced update will include an expanded and improved toolset, including a new ‘Motion’ tab for custom cinematic video capture.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Commentary –</strong> for those interested in the craft and creative decisions behind <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, the Enhanced update includes over four hours of developer commentary from a variety of voices involved in the making of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not explained here if or how the game will take advantage of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, but we’d anticipate that there’s at least a resolution boost to the Performance Mode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/24/microsoft-explain-why-they-bought-ninja-theory/">Microsoft’s acquisition of Ninja Theory in 2018</a> came off the back of the success of Hellblade. The studio had struggled to find stability for quite some time, despite critically acclaimed games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry. The first Hellblade was an experiment in small budget game development at AAA quality, and it was a major hit for the studio. It was also a PlayStation 4 console exclusive at its original 2017 launch before being ported to Xbox and Switch in subsequent years. That Microsoft’s acquisition meant that the sequel would be Xbox exclusive was unpopular with PlayStation gamers, to say the least. But Microsoft’s current cross-platform strategy is at least breaking down this barrier for one of the most visually stunning games of last year.</p>
<p>Playing the game last year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">we said</a>, “Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.”</p>
