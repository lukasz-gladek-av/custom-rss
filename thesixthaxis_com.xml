		<p>A little over five years ago, on the eve of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> launch, Phil Spencer might have been heralded as the console brand’s saviour, but as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-with-coreai-exec-asha-sharma-taking-over-as-microsoft-gaming-ceo/">he retires from the head of Microsoft’s gaming with almost immediate effect</a>, the picture of his time is distinctly less rosy.</p>
<p>The Xbox brand was in complete disarray in 2014. After gaining a foothold with the original Xbox and then stealing the early lead with the Xbox 360 (and paying the price with the Red Ring of Death debacle), Xbox began to shift its focus under Don Mattrick’s leadership. The Xbox 360 lineup felt played out by the end of the generation – each year inevitably leaned on a Halo or Gears of War game alongside a Forza – and a lot of emphasis was being placed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kinect">Kinect,</a> to challenge the Wii for family gaming. And when the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-reveal-how-microsoft-is-getting-its-message-wrong/">Kinect was then bundled in with the Xbox One</a>, making it both more expensive and less powerful than the PS4? And announced with so much emphasis being put on TV connectivity and with a tone-deaf message about always online DRM? It practically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">handed the upcoming generation to PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p>Having already filled in after Mattrick’s sudden departure, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/31/phil-spencer-fills-the-spot-of-head-of-xbox-at-microsoft/">Phil Spencer was promoted to lead all things Xbox in March 2014</a>, and his immediate actions were decisive. Kinect was cut out of the Xbox One box, the price was cut by $100, and being able to point to being a keen gamer himself, and not just another Microsoft suit, helped to build a little confidence in the platform’s future once more.</p>
<div id="attachment_469179"><p id="caption-attachment-469179">Phil Spencer at Gamescom 2015 –&nbsp;Image credit: Microsoft</p></div>
<p>Through the rest of the Xbox One generation, Phil Spencer’s appearances at E3 were a mixture of pondering what game dev-branded tee he would be wearing under his jacket, expected sequels and ports, and some truly transformational announcements. In 2015 it was backward compatibility for select Xbox 360 and (eventually) Xbox games, which helped to preserve ties to gaming history, when the only similar option on PS4 was for a full-blown port and remaster. 2016 saw Xbox games coming to Windows at the same time, first with Quantum Break and Forza Horizon 3, and eventually broadening to day-and-date launches on Steam. The Xbox One X in 2017 was Microsoft setting the story straight on hardware design, delivering the undisputed most-powerful console of the generation, shifting back to a more optimal architecture and paving the way for the future. But it was Xbox Game Pass and flurries of game studio acquisitions that started to herald the future of Microsoft’s gaming business.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass also launched in 2017, right at the point that it felt like a Netflix-like model would be relatively positive for the all the media we consume. The deal got even better a year later, as first party games would now come to Game Pass day and date, it came to PC in 2019, and then Project xCloud meant that you could play many of these games wherever you were, and take your progress between platforms. It sounded like a gaming utopia, even if it maybe wasn’t quite as smooth as you’d hope.</p>

<p>Having relied far too heavily on their tried and true franchises (and with some notable game cancellations and studio closures) the Xbox exclusives cupboard was feeling pretty bare. 2018 was the swing back in the other direction, Microsoft acquiring Compulsion Games, Ninja Theory, Obsidian, Playground Games, Undead Labs and inXile, and founding The Initiative. Some were long-time partners, other were still working on cross-platform games when they were acquired, and with a new generation on the horizon, it bode well for what was to come, even if a lot of PlayStation gamers felt put out by the prospect of their games now being exclusives… but let’s come back to that.</p>
<p>With the reveal of the Xbox Series X, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/13/xbox-series-x-reveal-project-scarlett-design-horizontal-tower-next-gen-ps5-rival/">a black obelisk of a design</a> coming alongside the first embers of the broadened Xbox Game Studios promising stunning visuals in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellblade-senuas-saga">Hellblade: Senua’s Saga</a>, not to mention the long-awaited <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, all backed by backward compatibility and Xbox Game Pass as a still tempting price point, there was cause to believe that Xbox could truly compete with Sony once again. OK, so the name wasn’t particularly great, following on from the Xbox One X, but on paper it looked good.</p>

<p>But the console name wasn’t the last befuddling thing for the Xbox Series X. For one thing, there was eventually the Xbox Series S, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/09/xbox-series-s-4-tflops-series-x-specs-more-powerful/">mystifyingly features less RAM than the Xbox One X</a>, meaning it couldn’t match the outgoing hardware and would soon become the butt of every game performance comparison video. Then there was the chopping and changing of the Optimized for Series X logo, Smart Delivery as a concept, and the commitment to cross-gen games from Microsoft studios that went out the window soon. Cross-gen support was pretty opaque over on PlayStation too, but this could have been a win for Microsoft, and it was fumbled.</p>
<p>That’s far from the only thing that now feels like a fumble. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/11/halo-infinite-delayed-to-2021-xbox-series-x-release-date/">Halo Infinite’s much-hated reveal seeing it delayed</a>, leaving just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium’s</a> split-screen horror and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/14/gears-5-hivebusters-dlc-you-should-play-it-needs-a-standalone-release/">Gears 5 Hivebusters DLC</a> to really act as launch window exclusives, it layered significance to the acquisition of Bethesda. Xbox needed something big to tip the tables, and Bethesda had seemingly been keen for a buyer. Oh sure, they still had to deliver timed exclusive games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/13/deathloop-review-ps5-pc/">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a> to PlayStation, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield</a> as an Xbox exclusive felt fairly natural given previous closeness.</p>

<p>But that didn’t help fill Xbox’s release schedule or make for huge hits. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-delayed-forge-mode-release-date-announcement-soon/">Halo Infinite had a troubled launch</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/forza-motorsport-is-now-only-coming-2023-seemingly-delayed-from-spring-release-window/">Forza Motorsport taking an age</a>, Redfall was a straight-up flop, Starfield drew a collective shrug. The main highlights (outside of the ever-reliable Forza Horizon 5) were the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/05/hi-fi-rush-review/">shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush</a> and the clutch of smaller projects that Obsidian was able to release.</p>
<p>Was it desperation that led Microsoft down the path to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-activision-what-does-acquisition-mean-for-gamers-playstation-xbox-game-pass-call-of-duty-exclusive/">acquire Activision Blizzard</a>? This eye-watering purchase is the real tipping point. Since closing the deal in 2023, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/22/microsoft-announces-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-for-july-august/">Xbox Series X|S has rapidly increased in price faster</a> than PlayStation 5, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-2025-price-increase-ubisoft-fortnite-crew/">Xbox Game Pass has ballooned both in cost and the bundled subscriptions</a> to justify this, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">the rules on ‘day one’ games changed</a> since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Call of Duty’s addition to the service</a>. Not only that, but the whole reason for Xbox as a console manufacturer has been called into question as Microsoft has chosen to bring its games to PlayStation. It’s done so in the most consistently inconsistent fashion, as well. Some games are simultaneous launches, others are clearly defined timed exclusives, and others more nebulous.</p>
<div id="attachment_469180"><p id="caption-attachment-469180">The ‘This is an Xbox’ marketing campaign</p></div>
<p>But if you want to play all these games on day one? Well, you can always find them on Xbox. But what even is an Xbox anymore? The marketing over the last couple of years would want you to know that everything’s an Xbox. There’s your consoles, of course, but there’s also Windows PCs, that ROG Xbox Ally handheld now (which is a handheld PC more than an Xbox console), or just streaming to your TV or phone. So… you don’t need to buy an Xbox anymore. Is that the message? Given how dominant PlayStation 5 has been and the massively strong start for the Switch 2, that’s seemingly what the gaming populace has taken away from this all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Phil Spencer, that now feels like his true legacy for Xbox, the brand being continually diluted. He was once its saviour, convincing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to stay the course through the Xbox One era, but when six years of rebuilding didn’t lead to early success in the following generation, cheques were signed to buy huge third-party publishers, shifting the expectations for what Xbox could deliver to Microsoft’s bottom line. It’s hard to say that Xbox is in a worse position now than when Spencer took over, when there’s more invested in it than ever and Microsoft’s studios have started to release great and varied games again, but the tone and what people expect from Xbox has changed. It now feels like less of a rival to PlayStation, and more like a publisher with consoles on the side.</p>

		<p>Naming your game after one of the tastiest foodstuffs on the planet is one way to strike a tone. Named after the beautiful Indian pancakes you’ll find at the best street food markets, it’s immediately clear that tasty treats lie at the very heart of Dosa Divas. That said, the colourful wrapper created by Outerloop Games is hiding something even more delicious inside.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOSA DIVAS - Release Date Trailer - Steam Demo Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bogYlMcNb80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There aren’t many games that give you the option to pout, photo modes notwithstanding, but that’s exactly what we found during the opening of our hands-on with Dosa Divas. We’re pouting because our sister Amani refuses to cook us some food, and once she gives in, that’s our first quest here. Collect some ingredients. The difference in Dosa Divas is that we’re going to do it in a mech.</p>


<p>It’s one heck of a mech, too. Goddess has the front end of a yellow Tuk Tuk, an old-school folding canopy, and at least one stick-on paper flower. It’s awesome. AND, it flaps its arms like a chicken to double jump. You can forget Gundam; this is the coolest mech of 2026.</p>


<p>Samara and Amani are the Dosa Divas, former restaurateurs turned Spirit-mech pilots, and who are able to enter the Preparation Realm to craft food and consumables through a series of mini-games. You select the ingredients – that’s a Bell Pepper here for the base, before added Basil for flavour. The pronunciation of “bay-zil” upsets me, but that’s the only wrinkle in an otherwise fun and tasty diversion.</p>
<p>The pair are about to set off on a road trip to see their parents – their first after Amani has been away for ten years – before they’re rudely interrupted by their other sibling, Lina, and her floating LinaMeals food billboard. Which she uses to insult the pair. Sam smashes the billboard up, and between that and a spot of sulking, it’s clear that a lot has happened, both in the last ten years, and between the sisters.</p>
<p>Perhaps most obviously, Lina has become a food-based overlord, controlling the populace with her LinaMeals and banning everyone else from actually cooking. She’s even got lawyers out and about to make sure everyone follows her rules. Fortunately, Samara and Amani aren’t about to let that stand, with a spot of turn-based combat coming into play whenever you’ve got someone standing in your way.</p>

<p>This is turn-based combat in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Expedition 33</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, rewarding extra damage or defence if you can time the right button press with the action on screen. I really think that this has become my favourite feature in turn-based games, keeping you on your toes and giving you some much-needed interaction during battles.</p>
<p>The culinary influence continues into combat, whether that’s Sam using a massive Karahi wok to pummel enemies or needing to match your attacks to the enemies’ food weakness. There’s a handy readout like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/octopath-traveler-0-review/">Octopath Traveller</a>, so you can easily remember that they’re weak to spicy or sour attacks, and just like Octopath, there’s also a boost function that lets you add extra attacks to your chosen action. It all comes together really well, and if you’re a fan of modern turn-based combat, Dosa Divas is doing it right.</p>

<p>Dosa Divas also looks and sounds absolutely brilliant. Its chunky, vibrant art style brings bags of character to the world, and everyone in it, with a real penchant for slightly off-kilter food-based visual gags and details. That’s all ramped up by funky, rock-infused riffs that are melded with more traditional Indian tones. The exceptional vibes are less surprising when you find out it’s coming from Outerloop Games, the Washington-based, minority-led team behind the incredible Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, and they’ve brought that same spirit to bear on Dosa Divas.</p>
<p>There aren’t many games that immediately lodge themselves in your psyche in the way that Dosa Divas has. Perfectly struck turn-based combat, killer art direction, and a sibling rivalry that’s enslaved the world set the tone for what looks to be one of 2026’s most intriguing indie releases.</p>
<p><em>Dosa Divas is launching on 14th April across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 1 &amp; 2 and PC, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4316300/Dosa_Divas_Demo/">check out a demo now on Steam</a>.</em></p>
