		<p>One of the highlights of my writing this year was heading out to meet the team from 10Chambers at the European Unity headquarters, and getting to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with Den of Wolves</a>. This futuristic heist game has a hell of a legacy – 10Chambers’ studio founder Ulf Anderson was the creator of Payday and GTFO – and even in our short time with the game, it was clear that the mix of planning, gunplay and crazy Inception-like sections was looking to be something special. While they’re continuing to work hard on the forthcoming game, 10Chambers are continuing a drip-feed of information, this time showcasing a new trailer, where they let four of the key community members for the game go hands-on. It looks like they had a pretty good time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Community Hands-On Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCUnDA8BpIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Robin Björkell, the Communications Director at 10 Chamber said, “I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer – but no. They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game – not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist – ask them,”</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear from one of them straight away, with RandomKenny, one of the invited players, saying, “Absolutely incredible experience being invited to play Den of Wolves early. Planning and executing how you’re going to tackle heists is super satisfying. I had such a blast playing, and I honestly can’t wait for the game to be released”.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the players can be seen tackling a heist in a previously unseen level inside a robot factory. Inside this gigantic factory, the players face resistance from both human and robotic enemies, all while deploying spider drills to hack vaults full of valuables.</p>

<p>Obviously, the big question remains, just when will Den of Wolves release? The team are remaining tight-lipped despite the huge groundswell of community interest, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to get a set date any time soon.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-458384">{“Source” : “NVIDIA APP”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}</p>
<p>“Even though we’ve not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We’re so grateful for our community’s support, and we can’t wait to show more details about the game. The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don’t think it’s fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out,” says Oscar J-T Holm, co-founder of 10 Chambers.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t get a release date for Den of Wolves set in stone quite yet, here’s hoping that we learn more in early 2026, at least in terms of beta testing or a potential demo.</p>
