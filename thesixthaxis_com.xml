		<p>Wishfully and Thunderful Games has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-of-lana-2">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a>, launching on 5th March 2026. There’s further surprises, though, as the game is also coming to Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, in addition to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC (and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> on day one), and there’s also a demo coming out next week!</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NksRtFjpYGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The playable demo will be going live on 11th February for all platforms, giving a first hands-on opportunity for Lana and Mui’s continuing adventure.</p>
<p>This next chapter in their tale will look to build on the strengths of the original. The story promises to be more ambitious, there’s new puzzles, and evolved companion mechanics for Lana to work with Mui. Lana is older, bigger and stronger, able to get around the world more readily, and there’s screenshots that show off swimming, which I believe is new for this game as well. Planet of Lana 2 still retains the delightful hand-painted visuals and the orchestral score.</p>
<p>Here’s Wishfully’s synopsis:</p>

<p>As greed and power divide the tribes of their home planet, Lana and her loyal companion Mui must stand together against the forces reshaping their world – struggling not just for survival, but for the very soul of their home. Embark on an unforgettable cinematic puzzle journey across Novo, where ancient mysteries and new threats will test your wits, challenge Lana’s unbreakable bond with Mui, and guide her toward her destiny.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the original game, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/22/planet-of-lana-review/">our review</a>, “Planet of Lana looks and sounds as wonderful as its original reveal promised. While it doesn’t redefine the adventure platformer, the adorable partnership between Lana and Mui, the gorgeous art direction and sweeping soundtrack make this well worth experiencing.”</p>

		<p>What is your favourite piece of video game music? If we started humming the opening theme to Halo, how many of you would join in? What about if it was Tifa’s Theme or the theme to Assassin’s Creed? All of these live rent-free in our heads, and no doubt yours too.</p>
<p>This is something that the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA as we all know it, is keenly aware of, and it is to their immense credit that they realised this more than 20 years ago when they held the inaugural British Academy Games Award for Music in 2002, celebrating “excellence in composition for a game music score, through original music and/or creative use of licensed track”.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, composer Jeremy Soule won for his work on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, beating the other nominees: Command &amp; Conquer: Generals, Primal, Republic: The Revolution, TimeSplitters 2 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. If, like us, you remember playing these games at launch, we can recommend good deals on walking sticks.</p>

<p>It’s with this rich catalogue of exceptional music in mind that BAFTA Games in Concert was produced. Its world premiere at the Royal Festival Hall on Saturday 31 January certainly felt celebratory. Conducted by BAFTA-winning composer Austin Wintory, and backed up by the 65-piece BBC Concert Orchestra and London Voices, attendees were met with iconic video game soundtracks from over the past two decades.</p>

<p>As the ensemble did what they do best, starting with Baldur’s Gate 3, a screen behind them played excerpts from the games they were celebrating. The thing that differentiates this from your average performance, however, is the game footage being cut with real-life singers, placed into a setting that reflects the game — in this case, a red-head in a green dress with Celtic jewellery singing opera.</p>

<p>What followed was a night of fantastic music. Wintory introduced Jessica Curry’s Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture before ploughing straight into Inon Zur’s Fallout 4, followed by Jesper Kyd’s Assassin’s Creed.</p>

<p>As excellent as these pieces are — and they are truly excellent, the choir singing the theme to Assassin’s Creed gave me goosebumps — this is where the issues with this performance came to the fore. It could be opening night tech issues, but the human performer intercut with the footage on the screen was playing a wooden flute-like instrument. However, despite seeing his fingers moving, I couldn’t hear him playing over what was in the room. Perhaps the AV team knocked the slider by mistake, but it felt a little off.</p>
<p>The other thing that was obviously missing after Wintory introduced Curry’s phenomenal score was any sort of intro or anecdote about what was to come. This is where real value could have been given to the paying audience — small insights into what each composer thought, liked or was inspired by as they crafted the melodies that have stayed with us for decades. They were in the room, it wouldn’t have been hard to pick their brains.</p>

<p>The best video game music concerts I’ve seen all have insights and trivia from the composer or lead musician to hang the performances on. It’s never for every piece, and it doesn’t have to be, but it provides not only a structure for the performance, but also a frame of reference for those who haven’t played every game that’s being showcased that evening.</p>
<p>Absent such a narrative, the BAFTA Games in Concert felt a lot more like a greatest hits compilation than a celebration, especially in the second half. Hopefully this was just the opening-night settling into a format and future audiences will get to hear why Disco Elysium has the tone they’re hearing, which instrument you see played on the screens during Far Cry 4 and what inspired the music behind Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it was a night of phenomenal music, played beautifully by some truly expert musicians. You really can’t beat live music, especially when a full orchestra is on stage.</p>
