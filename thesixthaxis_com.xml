		<p>A demo for the blacksmithing action RPG Blades of Fire is coming out tomorrow, 15th May, ahead of the game’s full release on 22nd May for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Epic.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/Blades_of_Fire/status/1922016237875294228">Announcing that a demo was coming earlier this week</a>, developer MercurySteam said, “Thank you SO much for the love in response to this! We weren’t planning to release a demo, but we know many of you wanted one, so we had to make it happen.”</p>


<p>A day later, they confirmed that the demo will arrive on 15th May. The demo will allow players to experience the first few hours of the game, with save data and progress able to carry over to the main game at launch.</p>
<p>A new world trailer previews some of the locales that will feature in the full game:</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - World Trailer [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5fHtXRfz28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the developer behind Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and more recently Metroid Dread, Blades of Fire is a Souls-like action RPG, though one that looks to put its own stamp on the genre with a new blacksmithing component for creating the weapons that you use.</p>

<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/07/blades-of-fire-is-the-blacksmithing-action-adventure-you-didnt-know-you-needed/">Playing the game earlier this year, I said</a>, “I really enjoyed my few hours with Blades of Fire. The original fantasy setting, the characters, and their voice acting and script all work for me – Aran’s voice acting reminds me of a cross between Matt Berry and Henry Cavill – but it’s really the unique touches for the combat and the puzzle-like forging that stand out. This is definitely one to keep an eye on when it launches in May.”</p>
