		<p>Fresh from awarding their coveted Peace Prize, FIFA are returning to gaming and it is Netflix, rather established software giant, who are to release the game in time for the 2026 World Cup. You will also be able to play it on “selected” televisions with a controller and on your phone via the Netflix mobile app.</p>
<p>The game will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, a company that has yet to release a game but is actually involved with 007: First Light. Delphi licensed James Bond and then partnered with IO Interactive who will make and publish the game.&nbsp; Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard has said “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP.”</p>


<p>“The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms,” said Alain Tascan, President of Games at Netflix. “We want to bring football back to its roots with something&nbsp;<i>everyone</i> can play with just the touch of a button.”</p>
<p>The game, if you believe the press release from Netflix, will let you “experience the emotion and drama of the tournament in its purest, most joyful form, &nbsp;in a format that’s fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in.”</p>

<p>You will be able to play solo or online, “All you need is Netflix and your phone.”</p>
