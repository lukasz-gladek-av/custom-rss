		<p>Publisher Awaken Realms has announced that Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, the follow up to Tainted Grail: Conquest, will be getting its full 1.0 release on May 23rd. The game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. If you are unfamiliar with Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, it is an open world fantasy action RPG with a branching storyline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utDgF27366E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will have three regions open to exploration including the Misty Horns of the South, the sun drenched Cuanacht, and the wintry Forlorn Swords. Across these three regions there will be over 200 side quests, more than 250 individual non playable characters, over 400 weapons and shields to equip yourself with, an inventory of over 50 spells, dozens of dungeons to explore, more than 100 enemy types, and the main quest will apparently have hundreds of endings based upon your actions and decisions. Another big addition for the full release of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will be the inclusion of a third person perspective, where before the game was going to be a solely first person perspective title.</p>
<p>Awaken Realms has also stated that applications are now open to help test the 1.0 build of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, and if you are interested you have to fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZHEbudX-V0ZE50XFt7nCfT1I8mXRgni95Ny8QAZ9repB_nA/viewform">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon 1.0 version playtest</a> form. If your application is successful you will gain access to the main release of the game, though some content will still be missing, and an exclusive Discord channel to provide feedback directly to the development team.</p>

<p>In our Tainted Grail: Conquest review, Jason said, <em>“Any game so good that you can’t resist doing just one more battle in is a game well worth paying attention to, and Tainted Grail definitely manages that.”</em></p>

</ul>
<p>However, the two biggest games of the week have gone unscored for the time being. Gamoc wrote a review in progress for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/"><strong> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>, the great new turn-based RPG with a truly unique style, while Jim shared his thoughts on <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/25/oblivion-remastered-is-perfect-for-fans-on-the-long-wait-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>&nbsp;</strong>and what it means for long-suffering TES fans who are patiently waiting for a new sequel.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Dom had a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/f1-25s-braking-point-3-aims-to-tell-motorsports-most-impactful-story/"><strong>F1 25’s returning Braking Point 3 story mode</strong></a>, which is arriving right around the time of the F1 movie and will provide an interesting parallel narrative. I went hands on with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/tron-catalyst-preview-glitchy-but-in-a-good-way/">TRON: Catalyst</a></strong>, the isometric action game from Bithell that will continue on the world narrative they started in TRON: Identity.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman&nbsp;</strong>was flush with gaming time, so he dipped back into Atomfall, made some more progress in Blue Prince where he’s considering looking up a guide to connect a few of the dots, and made a start on Oblivion’s remaster soaking up the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead and we’ll see you back here on Tuesday!</p>
