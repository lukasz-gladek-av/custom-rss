		<p>Given the accolades and sales of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring you may have assumed that a sequel would be on the cards, but that is not the case. At the PlayStation Partner Awards 2024 Japan Asia, Elden Ring director and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked if a second game was being planned.</p>
<p>“We’re not really considering developments such as an Elden Ring 2,” said Miyazaki, but then acknowledge that they may work on the sequel in the future. He also suggested the franchise could continue in another form such as a movie or animated series.</p>


<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was released this year, a massive expansion to the original game. We reviewed and found it slightly lacking, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/">scoring it 7/10.</a></p>
<p>“I find myself wishing Shadow of the Erdtree had a continuation from one of the endings of Elden Ring, or ventured back to explore the Shattering itself,” said self proclaimed Elden Ring fan Jason. “Instead, it feels like a filler episode in Naruto. Sure, the fights are cool, and there’s a new progression system to work through, but what is the point if nobody is going to acknowledge it again for the rest of the series. But hey, at least the Convergence Mod team will have a field day with all of this new stuff to play with.”</p>
<p>The expansion is so big that this years The Game Awards have decided that it’s not DLC and in fact a new game, and is a contender for this years Game of the Year award.&nbsp; This year’s event takes place on December 13th 2024 with Astro Bot leading the nominations with seven nods.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/elden-ring-patch-1-14-decreases-shadow-of-the-erdtree-final-boss-stats/"> patch released</a> for the game addressed issues players raised about the difficulty of the final boss in Shadow of the Erdtree, nerfing their attack damage, attack stamina, and attack range.</p>
