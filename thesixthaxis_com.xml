		<p>With nDreams looking to revolutionise VR action games once more with the release of Reach on Thursday this week, and following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/hands-on-reach/">my hands on session with the game</a>, I had a chance to sit down with Glenn Brace, Head of the studio to chat about Reach and find out exactly why those death defying leaps don’t make you want to reach – aha! – for the sick bag.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Please introduce yourself and explain how you came to be working on Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> My name’s Glenn Brace, and I’m the head of studio for Elevation, and a living, breathing VR evangelist. Long story short, I’ve been in games devs for like 20 years but there’s only so many generations of platforms you can go through with the same IPs, so when VR arrived, that was for me the true next-gen. This is a new frontier, there’s new things. It doesn’t matter if you’re a mega studio or a little studio. The innovation is just there for the sake of it.</p>


<p>More recently, I wanted to get back closer to development, back to what is the best for VR. So nDream Elevation was born. The studio was created to look at the future, work on the sort of tech leading to VR innovation and where VR is going. We are the driving core tech, leading that core tech in the rest of the business. The rest of the business can use that and elevate themselves from that, but we are pushing that. We’re making the new stuff.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When we started the studio for this game, we started with the goal of reinterpreting action adventure for VR. That was the goal. We had a hypothesis, which was that we believe through one-to-one physical action simulation, you will have more immersion and therefore more presence. And more immersion presence means it’s more emotional. The more emotional games, the more memorable, the more fun. So, that was the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We set off and set ourselves a task, “Right, let’s discover one-to-one control and prove to ourselves if it truly is agency granting”. So, we tried different jumps, we tried running, how you fail and fall, what is the believability of you as a character. There’s so many metrics to discover.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Give me the Elevator pitch for Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Essentially, it’s action-adventure reimagined for VR. And the root of that is absolute agency-granting, second-to-second role play. What does that mean? That is a translation from the famous genres that we love, such as Tomb Raider. All those games out there that we’ve loved before in the past, but brought into VR, how does that work? We know there will be challenges doing it, but we’re going to fix those challenges and bring the essence of role play to that genre for VR. It’s run, jump, swing, fling. It’s action adventure in the true sense and giving that power to the player.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Where did the original idea come from? You mentioned Tomb Raider.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So it’s definitely an influence of what we’re trying to capture, but I think what’s really important about our game is aas a translation of the action adventure genre. So I wouldn’t go into it thinking we’ve made a Tomb Raider – we haven’t – it’s very much what needs to be, different. For starters going first person is in itself a big change. Historically, cinematics have played a large part in that genre, but we don’t want to break the immersion, so even the nature of that format needs to change.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> I played a good hour and a half and it felt like half the time, and not once did I feel any sort of motion sickness or dizziness despite all the running and jumping, how on earth have you managed that?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So, comfort was a big thing, and we set out to tackle that. One of the key factors of that was ‘FBA’, full body awareness, one of the key components. It’s not just to render the body and see it in game, although that’s cool, it’s that we have more than the tracking points. We simulate the wrist, the arm angle, we simulate the elbows, we simulate the body, the hips, the shoulders, the neck. When we have all that information, it makes things like mantling so much smoother and more reliable. That allows flow, it allows proper parkour, player-driven you’re-in-control flow.</p>
<p>That extends into jumping as well. If you get a motion that you’re not in control of it can send you over the edge. So for jumping, you actually move your arms as if you are about to take leap in real life to start the jump in-game, and this fools your body in to thinking your are actually doing it.</p>
<p>Another natural thing is when you jump over an edge, you look where you land, you look down, and you can tune the arc of the land specifically on that tight pillar. It feels natural; you do it in a very natural way. So, again, it’s more comfortable. Suddenly, we’ve got a level of parkour and jumping platforming that is super cool.</p>
<p>We also simulate body mass and weight, and that comes back to how you play traditional platforming. Once you familiarize yourself with your body mass and weight, how you use it, you can become skilful in platforming, and therefore in control. When you put those things together, the realization of it, the sense of weight, the sense of mass, the physics of it, the aftertouch, you’ve got a new experience in VR.</p>
<p>One of the goals I always wanted, and I always say this, was to make someone role-playing act in the interest of self-preservation. Faced with a giant leap, will you stop and think, “I’m not going to jump on that. No way. I’m going to do this”? In a standard game you’d do it anyway, you will die, start again, do it, die, start again. We wanted the players to be in the moment and think, making them prioritise their sense of survival in that world.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> So, given that every action adventure game these days gets a TV show or film, who would direct the Reach movie?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Well, I can tell you, not Michael Bay! We started Reach with the idea that it’s going to be action-packed, but the reality is the emotions and the moments, they’re a lot smaller, a lot more contained. So, I think it’s a more intimate experience now than when we first set out. So, I need to find a director that’s kind of in touch with the emotional side. Who did the Star Wars film everyone really liked?</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Rogue One? Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Yeah, I’ll go with Gareth Edwards. He did also Monsters which could have been a big loud film but it was actually quiet and poignant. So, yeah, I would go with Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Glenn for speaking to us about this fascinating project.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>King of Meat is a strange name for a game, to state the obvious, and yet it totally fits the daft modern cartoon vibe that it’s going for, with bizarro riffs on quirky jokes running throughout. Set in Loregok, a techno-medieval world that’s gone absolutely ga-ga for the titular game show, your path to stardom is to dive into the dungeons, overcome platforming challenges, battle past skeleton minions, and make it through to the end. And you can become a star dungeon designer as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat: Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/stZ0Vvfvd6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, this is dungeon crawling by way of the dearly departed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> – and this makes complete sense given Glowmade’s background. Where LIttleBigPlanet pioneered accessible User Generated Content (UGC), this has exploded in importance over the last few years with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/roblox">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> becoming home to entire universes of created game experiences. King of Meat is much closer to a LittleBigPlanet or a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/05/review-modnation-racers/">ModNation Racers</a> in scope, sticking to its particular genre and trying to nail the fundamentals.</p>



<p>With that in mind, the third-person platforming and dungeoneering is eminently accessible. You’ve got a jump and a Yoshi-like flutter jump that is basically all you need to get around the world, and then there’s a variety of weapons for when enemies spawn and rush towards you. You start off with sword and shield and a crossbow for a bit of range, but can swap those out for a hammer, grenade launcher, knuckle dusters and more that you unlock as you progress. The melee weapons all have particular styles, basic and charged attacks, and attack combos that you can quickly learn.</p>

<p>Alongside these core weapons are a gradually growing range of magical abilities, first with a bellowing belch that will repel all before you, or a simple healing flask that can come in handy for tougher levels, and beyond to giant horse hooves stamping down from above.</p>
<p>You’ll apply all of this to levels that blend together platforming, combat and puzzling. Glowmade has stuffed the game with around 100 levels – created, in-game, by Komstructor – and they run the gamut of ideas, being sorted into three buckets of difficulty and labelled with generalised tags for what to expect from them.</p>
<p>It’s nice and easy-going on the whole. Combat does lack a bit of oomph to it, and it can often feel like you’re not really doing much to the hordes you’re battling – possibly because, for the tougher enemies, you really aren’t. When there’s four of you, you can always pick up buddies that have been downed, or they can give up and respawn from the gloop cans at the next checkpoint, but if all of you are downed, it’s game over. I really enjoyed some of the examples of puzzling that I saw, though, leveraging the basics of switch pulling, button shooting, and bringing power cells to key locations alongside game logic to provide some light brain teasers. One example had you pulling switches in order, Simon Says style, while another had multiple switch combos opening different doors. A bit trickier to manage when playing without voice communication, mind you.</p>

<p>And, of course, a lot of that will sound instantly familiar to anyone who explored the creation tools of LBP or Dreams. There’s a straightforward logic engine running in the background that can be twisted and bent to create all manner of things, from simply spawning in enemies as you and your team enter a room, to setting spike and flame traps to run on timers, program platforms to move around the world as you need, and much, much more complicated tasks.</p>
<p>The creation tools try to make all of that as manageable as possible, and I think Glowmade has done a fantastic job of organising those tools and providing the views you need. It starts with a blueprint phase where you place and connect rooms and hallways together, matching up their doors together, and it’s here that you’ll really realise that this dungeon builder works entirely on a single plane, albeit with doors on two levels and the ability to raise and lower the scenery within these spaces. That does put some shackles on what you could create, but that’s not really a bad thing.</p>
<p>From there you can switch to a 3D view and manipulate the scenery, put in place those traps, enemies and spawners, and then delve into the nitty-gritty of hooking up and configuring the logic behind it all.</p>

<p>Again, there’s huge amounts of potential and possibilities here –&nbsp;a user level I saw shrouded the whole level in darkness, with braziers flaring only as you reached certain points, forcing you to fight enemies mostly in the dark –&nbsp;and that can be hugely rewarding if you have the time and the desire to really embrace this. It can also be a bit daunting and overwhelming to try and come up with a concept and then actually make it. It’s really down to the player themselves what they want to get out of this, but I’ve come to be more of a consumer of UGC games than a creator.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of joy to simply consuming King of Meat, though. This is a fun setting, with the shared space lobby area having you run back and forth between different vendors, who always have quirky things to chat to you about. Then there’s the interstitial cartoons, which are all fantastic and lean right in on modern cartoon styles with an excellently pitched sense of humour. It’s absolutely geared towards younger gamers, but adults will get a wry smile out of it too. Oh, and I’ve got to mention the announcer who introduces each level and booms over your achievements like it’s a cross between Wipeout and Robot Wars.</p>
