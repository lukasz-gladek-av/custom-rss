		<p>The classic GameCube game Kirby Air Ride is getting a sequel with Kirby Air Riders coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1C4XSLAacNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are pretty thin on the ground outside of the reveal trailer, but we see Kirby riding on his jet-powered star and joined by three other Kirbys on a variety of different craft.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is in development with Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai at the helm. Sakurai is a truly beloved figure for the openness with which he led Smash Bros. development over the past decades, often in the foreground to demo new fighters that were coming to the smash hit series. Given the labour of love that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> was for him, it’s great to see that he’s taken a bit of a break from the series to lead a different classic series revival.</p>

		<p>Nintendo revealed Donkey Kong Bananza for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming to the new console on 17th July 2025, just a month and a half after the Switch 2’s June debut.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_EIYSSl3cY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay here is dramatically different and more modern than Rare’s 90s classic.</p>
<p>There’s a big emphasis on DK’s strength, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p>there’s a lot of great looking 3D platforming here, with big camera sweeps that shift the perspective an awful lot. Donkey kong has been given a big restyle to match the updated look of the character from the Super Mario Bros. movie.</p>

<p>There’s no real clue what the story will be this time, but we’d put some money down on the gallery of crazed baddies having stolen his banana haul. What does seem to have also happened is DK having made a friend with a purple crystalline looking creature.</p>
<p>Developing…</p>
