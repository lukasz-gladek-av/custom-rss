		<p>Something strange is brewing at Blake Manor. Set in 1897 Ireland at a remote hotel, you arrive to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, but there’s the occult and strange mysteries to unpeel before the truth can be discovered, and there’s just 48 hours to go before a ritual will bring everything to a head in The Séance of Blake Manor.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKI7DVrhWL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Spooky Doorway cut their teeth on the detective mystery genre with the Darkside Detective series, but Blake Manor pushes things in a rather different direction. This is a sprawling mystery with dozens of potential suspects to rule out, a ticking clock that determines the flow and nature of your investigation, and obviously plenty of potentially supernatural goings on, steeped in distinctly Irish mythology.</p>


<p>The opening of the game, though, is much more guided and direct. The deep Irish voice of Declan Ward lulls you into the dour, sombre tone of this investigation, as he takes train and carriage to the manor’s gate. Trudging through the gardens at the front of the manor, the setting and thunderstorm is immediately evocative of this kind of detective story. It doesn’t help that a shadowy figure stood by the fountain suddenly bursts into a flurry of crows flapping away, leaving a shawl behind which humorously suggests it was actually seven crows in a trench coat and not a hunched-over old lady.</p>
<p>The lobby of the manor hotel is empty, save for traditional jack-o-lanterns carved out of oversized turnips –&nbsp;Halloween originated in Ireland, after all. but ringing a bell brings the sour-faced concierge to the table, whose appearance immediately raises questions. How did his glasses come to bear a large crack in one of the lenses? Why is he so tense and preoccupied with the time?</p>


<p>You can question him directly over Evelyn Deane’s disappearance, and follow up on the visual clues found by a bit of traditional point &amp; click screen scouring, but he’s evasive and preoccupied at best. Something about needing to deal with telegrams by hand…</p>
<p>As he retreats to his office, you can start poking around, but the deeper you investigate, the more time passes. There’s no ticking clock mapped to real time, but rather time will advance whenever Ward interacts with objects and characters in the game. It’s an interesting choice that might force you to be more judicious than is typical for games, where players often have a tendency to interact with anything and everything possible. Still, there’s immediately some curious clues to uncover. Poking around in the side rooms for luggage and coats, you can see something hidden behind an air vent, or overhear the concierge muttering about a busted window. There’s also the log book that you can snoop through to see if Miss Deane truly had checked herself out of the manor and left –&nbsp;unsurprisingly, this does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The trick is figuring out how to fix the telegram machine, to bring the concierge out of his office and let you snoop within there, and that means constructing a battery from an assortment of electrical discs. A simple starter puzzle, but a nice one to make you feel ever-so-slightly smart.</p>
<p>Much smarter, of course, than when I just bungled into the office and got told to leave. Then I had the bright idea of going out and climbing through the window… except the concierge was still there, banning me from the hotel grounds and getting a dismal game over screen.</p>
<p>Not my finest moment, but quite hilarious. I got it right the second time round.</p>

<p>It was when heading to bed that the real spookiness started, a thoroughly demonic dream sequence befitting of the Overlook Hotel or Twin Peaks. It’s all brooding, dark and bathed in red light as you walk down fish-eyed hallways, and still absolutely in keeping with the graphic novel inspired art style through the rest of the game. The setting is rendered in 3D, but characters are all represented with eight-direction character art, while comic book cutaway panels give a distinctive tone.</p>
<p>It’s only after waking from a frightful night that the game starts to loosen its reigns on your investigation. Stepping out of the room the next day, after a loud noise startled the assorted guests, you’re greeted by all manner of potential suspects, coming from all manner of background and superstitions, and all with their own secrets to hide.</p>

<p>With so many names and faces thrown at you, having a physical pen and paper will no doubt be key to keeping track of everything, but the game does have built in tools within the Mystery Map. This neatly organises all the key clues and narrative threads that you’ve uncovered so far, joining them up for you in a colour-coded web that makes them easier to digest. At various points, you’ll have to make a deduction, filling in the blanks from a particular phrase using the clues and evidence you’ve gathered.</p>
<p>Alongside this, you also have a timetable that lets you track the known locations of all the staff and guests, automatically populated from things like a staff rota and messages you’ve managed to find between people. If you need to find a particular person at a specific time, this will absolutely help, and Spooky Door is building in a feature to let you rewind and retry portions of the game if you run out of time before the séance itself.</p>

<p>All too soon, our time with the game came to an end, just as it would broaden out to reveal the full scope of the mysteries. Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/glum-early-access-preview-bringing-a-unique-stinkiness-to-the-first-person-booter/</link>

		<p>Glum is not your usual game protagonist. He has no chiselled jaw, no artfully coiffure ‘do and absolutely zero charisma. In fact, he’s a completely unlikeable stinky little goblin, which paradoxically makes him charming in his own way. What he does have, though, is the kind of feet that not even the darkest parts of the internet would pay to take a look at. It is fortunate that quite early in the game you’ll find a boot to cover up the offending appendages, as you’ll be spending a lot of time staring at that foot.</p>
<p><iframe title="GLUM | Official Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRQDbVo5oJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Glum begins with the titular ‘hero’ locked up in a barracks. Your first task is to find a way to escape and this takes the form of a well designed tutorial. You learn how to kick objects, obviously, but also how to use kicks to jump higher and even chain jumps together. As you progress you’ll also find a magical boot that you can fire off to reach distant objects and enemies. You’re not entirely restricted to kicking, however, as you can pick up some objects and carry them so that you can, well, kick them at things. Look, kicking is what this game is about, OK?</p>


<p>The world of Glum is bright and colourful and feels like it’s been taken straight out of a Shrek film. You’ll face hordes of armoured knights and archers, all just needing a swift kick in the face to conquer. Combat is made more interesting by the vast numbers of hazards scattered around the environment, from fires to iron maidens. Kicking foes into these reminds me a lot of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review/">Bulletstorm</a>, with obvious nods to the grandfather of kicking games, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.</p>


<p>As an Early Access title, Glum currently offers one major level to explore, as well as the tutorial area. This might not sound like much, but the map is fairly large and has a decent amount of hidden areas and secrets. As well as the core objective (in this case ringing bells to disturb the local commander) there are gnomes to smash and – <em>ahem – </em>&nbsp;mature magazines to track down. These unlock extra boots and abilities respectively and this looks to be one of the biggest areas of potential in the game with skills that can change the way you play hopefully added as development progresses. Finding these hidden items adds a welcome amount of depth and replayability.</p>
<p>Gnomes can be tracked down by listening out for their sinister little chuckles whilst the jazz mags are either hidden away behind intricate platforming sections or rewards for sidequests. These sidequests are appropriately bizarre, too, with highlights being kicking rats into a sentient campfire or feeding a chicken to a mysterious creature in a well. I don’t think Glum will be getting any PETA recommendations to be honest.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished the main questline of the level you get to face a wonderfully ludicrous boss battle that would be a shame to spoil. This encounter requires that you use all of your abilities to triumph and is a good demonstration of what the full game will hopefully offer. Once you’ve cleared the narrative part of the game there is an arena mode to enjoy, but an update killed my save so this wasn’t unlocked for me to try out.</p>
<p>This latter point is core to the Early Access experience. If you like the sound of Glum and want to support the devs as they bring it to completion then it’s well worth the price, but there can be snagging issues along the way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2235550/view/544485372295381678">A roadmap has been outlined</a> by CinderCat Games, with a festive clown-filled level, another arena mode, building up to a Halloween level this autumn.</p>
<p>It’s always important to know what you’re signing up for. In Glum’s case, I think there’s plenty of fun to be had in its current form and I will definitely be going back in for more once the extra levels are added.</p>

		<p>A <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition to the UK government by the Stop Killing Games initiative</a> has passed the 100,000 signatures threshold to be considered for a debate in parliament. <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">A similar petition in the European Citizens’ Initiative</a> is also nearing its 1 million signature threshold to be considered by the European Commission.</p>
<p>The UK government already responded to the petition after it passed the 10,000 signature threshold in February, saying “We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.”</p>


<p>However, a debate in parliament is always good, and UK residents will be able to have their voices heard on the matter through their local MP – if this matters to you, then firstly the petition remains open until 14th July to add your signature and receive notifications, and you should try to get in touch with your MP to add weight to this argument. EU residents have until 31st July to help this petition cross the line.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a consumer movement that came into being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">after Ubisoft’s announced shutdown of The Crew’s online servers last year</a>, arguing that many modern games “are sold effectively as goods – with no stated expiration date – but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.”</p>

<p>In the interests of game preservation and of simply letting people continue to play the games that they have paid for, SKG hopes to petition lawmakers to implement rules to prevent publishers from effectively killing games. This is not a call to for publishers to support games and host servers indefinitely, or even to release source code,&nbsp;but rather to provide an end-of-life plan for titles with core online components that ensure that the game remains playable in some state. In SKG’s proposal, this would still enable subscription-based games, MMORPGs, free-to-play titles and the many business models and styles of game that publishers have created, and existing games would not be affected, but plans would need to be put in place for future games to have this end-of-life version to ensure an offline mode.</p>
<p>For more on this, and the various edge cases and counterarguments that have to be catered to, please see <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the Stop Killing Games FAQ</a>, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo">there’s some frankly bizarre and prehaps wilfully misconstrued pushback</a> which was recently addressed by SKG’s founder Ross Scott – this video arguably spurred these two petitions on to some semblance of plausibility.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we already have a practical example of how this is possible for publishers to do in the modern games industry, let alone with historical examples. Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>This should be the default course of action for companies to take, and we would encourage you to sign and follow these petitions, if you’re in the UK or EU.</p>
