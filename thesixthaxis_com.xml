		<p>I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/">Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch</a> – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. </p>

<p>The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. </p>
<p>Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. </p>


<p>Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out. </p>
