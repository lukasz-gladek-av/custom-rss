		<p>The first brand new game has been announced at Summer Games Fest, and it is Mortal Shell 2, with the trailer confirming the game will be available in 2026 to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series XS. Mortal Shell 2 is being billed as a standalone action RPG sequel, with players known as the Harbinger and using shells to take on all sorts of enemies, some of them looking very grotesque.</p>

<p>In our Mortal Shell review, Jason said, <em>“Mortal Shell is just an incredibly satisfying experience. It’ll punish you constantly, but if you can master the mechanics it lays out in front of you then you’ll have an incredible time of things. The lore is a little more obvious that in other soulslikes, and the story it tells and the world it puts you in are both rather enthralling. This is definitely a game that fans of dying a lot will enjoy, but it’s probably not for everyone.”</em></p>
