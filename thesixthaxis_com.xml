		<p>It’s been the week of the Switch 2 pre-order. I won’t bore you with the details, but getting mine felt like one of those levels in a game where annoying enemies keep swiping health off you, making you fall down a hole, and sending you back to the start. Still, I got one in the end, and now I can rest easy that I won’t be mournfully watching all my friends playing Mario Kart World on the 5th of June. When I wasn’t doing that, I was playing the excellent South of Midnight, which has to be one of the most beautiful games of 2025, more Yakuza: Like A Dragon and loads of retro stuff as well, including a blast on Sega Rally Championship and Mario Kart 64.</p>

<p>Aran has played and reviewed his first game of the year contender, Blue Prince. He says, “Every puzzle game fan should play it, because this game will be talked about for years. I’ve also started Promise Mascot Agency for review, and that has made me chuckle quite a few times. Review hopefully next week.” Blue Prince is on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, so you really have no excuse not to play it!</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been Destiny 2ing as well as making a start on Steel Seed. His review of that will appear in two weeks!</p>
<p>Jim is making good progress in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and he says that some of those rougher gameplay edges have been worn down after unlocking various character upgrades. “Naoe has become a truly overpowered Shinobi who can clear enemy castles with ease – that’s probably thanks to me fiddling with some of the stealth difficulty options but it makes the game damn more enjoyable.”</p>


<p>Gamoc has kept things simple this week, playing Hogwarts Legacy and Balatro. Meanwhile, Steve has enjoyed some time revisiting The Simulation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/the-talos-principle-reawakened-review-more-in-heaven-and-earth-than-your-philosophy/">Talos Principle Reawakened</a>, and he says that, “It joins The Blue Prince in possibly the best day of releases for puzzle fans in history. Also finished Atomfall with the self-destruct ending but will replay at some point to clear up stuff I didn’t do. Played some indie games for review so will get those up soon. Still persevering with Skywalker Saga but easing the pain of that by starting the beautiful South of Midnight. Combat is a bit one-note (although abilities are unlocking to help this) but the world is superb and I’ve always got time for a good linear game with a solid story and an identity of its own.”</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, has continued to give us a rundown of every game he played on Switch 2, which has only continued to cause jealousy and dissent amongst the team.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played? And did you get a Switch 2 pre-order?</p>
