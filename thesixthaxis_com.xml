		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</p>

		<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu has held a video call with staff outside Japan and announced a “fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization”. Jobs will be cut and those left will be expected to spend more time working in the office. The move is part of a cost-cutting exercise to save 3 billion yen ($19.6 million), although the last attempt at restructuring the company ended up costing the company 9.8 billion&nbsp;yen.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not announced how many people will be let go and said that affected staff will be notified today. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a> are reporting that over 140 people are at risk in the London office, including those working in marketing, QA, and sales.</p>


<p>Alongside this, the company also released a financial statement along with a commentary that stated that they are working with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo on a project “aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies”. Their goal is to “automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027”.</p>
<p>The financial report shows that game sales for the company are down 15% year-on-year but despite this, operating income has increased by 28.8% due to reduced marketing and development costs.</p>
