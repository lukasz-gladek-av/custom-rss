		<p>Expression Games has shared a first look at gameplay from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, the studio’s large scale multiplayer sequel set to release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/05/hell-let-loose-review-ps-plus-ps5-xbox-series-x/">the WW2 original</a>, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam jumps to 1973 and one of the other most significant wars fought in the 20th century. Much like the original game, two teams of 50 players will fight for supremacy, but this time will be tramping through the jungles, boating up and down rivers and flying over the trees of Vietnam. You can absolutely see the game’s visuals are looking to capture the way that this war was represented in cinema, though I’d hope to see a little more variety in the time of day so it’s not always so sunset-y.</p>
<p>Fresh gameplay additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S next year, but you can check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August. I said, “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.”</p>
