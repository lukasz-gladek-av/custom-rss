		<p>Paradox Interactive and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> developer Colossal Order are going their separate ways, the companies have announced, with ongoing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines II</a> and the franchise in general moving to a separate studio under the Paradox umbrella, Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>Colossal Order will wrap up on a few updates – the Bike patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes and more, as well as a beta of the Editor and Asset Mods. Iceflake Studios (who also happen to be based in Tampere, Finland and released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/08/surviving-the-aftermath-review-ps4/">Surviving The Aftermath in 2021</a>) will be getting up to speed to take over development from the start of 2026, and will be responsible for free updates, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, and future expansions and content packs.</p>


<p>Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, writes, “For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order. When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</p>
<p>Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive added, “Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we’ve enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it’s remarkable how much we’ve achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.”</p>

<p>And Iceflake Studio Manager Lasse Liljedahl said, “Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility. There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</p>

<p>After the broad success and popularity of Cities: Skylines, it’s no secret that Colossal Order has grappled with the scope of developing Cities: Skylines II. Originally announced as a cross-platform release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/cities-skylines-2-delayed-on-console-to-spring-2024-still-coming-to-pc-on-24th-october/">the console versions were delayed</a> and it arrived for PC at the end of 2023 to a wave of dissatisfaction over game optimisation, features and bugs. CO plugged away at the game for the past two years, but had to indefinitely delay the console version, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">pushed back and refund DLC</a>. It outwardly looked like the team might have turned a corner, releasing the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC a few weeks ago, but clearly all parties felt it was time for a clean slate.</p>
<p>Hopefully Iceflake is able to quickly get up to speed with the game, and we look forward to seeing what Colossal Order’s next project might be.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released the first images of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda’s live-action film adaptation</a>, confirming that filming is underway in a “lush, natural setting.”</p>
<p>Borrowing the phone with the company’s social media account logins, <a href="https://xcancel.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067">Shigeru Miyamoto writes</a>:</p>


<p>“This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link.”</p>

<p>“Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.”</p>

<p>You’ve got to say that the casting of Bo and Benjamin looks pretty spot on visually, and it’s interesting to see the direction that they’ve taken visually. It certainly looks to lean into the visual identity of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> era of the game series, with Zelda in a blue dress and the pair of them hanging out in a field. In fact, I think I remember one or two of the flashback story beats from Breath of the Wild that this could be recreating.</p>
<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>

			<p>To relax, sometimes you just need some nice food or a puzzle to concentrate on to keep the rest of the world at bay. Well, at least, I need that. Developer Mimmox has taken those two ways to relax and created a calming puzzler called Umami, in which you put together food puzzles made of blocks of wood. There is no fail state or timer to worry about, it’s just you, the pieces, a reference picture, and a colourful set up in which to craft a masterpiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Umami - Official Release Date Trailer | The MIX Fall Game Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iy67RnJssE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each of the fifteen puzzles present in Umami has been crafted by Mimmox, with each one having an animal chef and decorative piece associated with it. The majority of levels have a collectible card hidden in the environment somewhere, which you can find by clicking on the items around you until you discover them. And when you complete a puzzle, you can touch the animal piece to set off some colourful sparks.</p>



<p>To get to that end point of completing a puzzle, you need to put it together. Much like in real life when you attempt a puzzle, you will find the pieces scattered in a completely random order with the only option being to try and get pieces to fit together while looking at the reference picture. Umami does have a reference picture for each puzzle, but it only shows the front and back full on, so not everything is given away for these 3D wooden food sculptures. Pieces can be rotated to be placed anywhere, but you want to find the right place. Once a piece is put in the right place in the correct way up it will shake and become unselectable. The bigger pieces are generally easier to place whereas the smaller pieces can look similar, and you may be trying to put those in a few different places before finally finding the correct slot.</p>

<p>Umami is a very colourful game and each puzzle looks fantastic with lots of details and great care taken to make sure the pieces fit properly. Each of the dishes has inspiration from real world recipes with a fanciful touch, and some of the puzzles reference different seasons and holidays, like Halloween and Christmas. Throughout, the soundtrack is smooth and calming adding to the relaxed atmosphere that the game is wanting to put across to you as the player.</p>

<p>I would say that Umami isn’t a game where you try to blast through all fifteen puzzles in one sitting. Instead, I recommend doing two or three puzzles at a time when you have a bit of free time, then go off and do something else. My overall playtime was approximately six hours, but spreading Umami’s puzzles out over a few days heightened the relaxation element of the game.</p>
<p>There was only one real issue I had while playing and that was puzzle pieces sometimes getting stuck in the wrong position until I could actually click them out, or a puzzle piece flying across the level if it definitely was not going to fit in a place. A gentle drop would have sufficed instead of seeing a piece fly off, breaking some of that relaxing immersion.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Umami is a very well crafted puzzle game that lets you take things at your own pace. Each of the puzzles is very well put together and look great, while the levels themselves provide a relaxing atmosphere. A couple of minor issues with the puzzle pieces do not totally detract from a game that lets you just sit and enjoy yourself.	</p></div>
