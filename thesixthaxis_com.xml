            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While the Switch 2 is dominating headlines around the world, it’s easy to forget the little guys. There’s plenty handhelds that are out there making people’s lives better without all the pomp and grandeur. Enter the Miyoo Flip, a retro handheld designed for emulation that takes some clear inspiration from one of Nintendo’s most iconic handhelds, the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>This clamshell device brings all the nostalgia to the yard. Picking it up had me reminiscing for days about my red Game Boy Advance SP with Groudon carefully embossed on the cover, and the days I spent playing Pokemon Ruby, Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. The Miyoo Flip feels like the original device, and given that the SP is arguably still one of the best handheld designs we’ve ever had, that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Measuring just over 8cm in either direction and 2.5cm thick when folded shut, it’s genuinely pocketable, though there’s also a very lovely hardshell case in the box that makes it a bit too chunky for your pocket. It easily fits in your bag though, and you don’t have to worry about it getting damaged at all. It’s so small compared to modern handheld PCs and consoles that you don’t need to think too hard about taking it everywhere with you, and our review unit has already been around the world a bunch of times with me without any hassle.</p>
<p>There’s a variety of different colours available, with our review unit arriving in a truly retro black and red livery. It looks like the contents of every kids’ bedroom in the 80s and early 90s, and the lighter plastics used make it feel pretty authentic to the period as well. It doesn’t feel premium, but when it’s priced around £70 you’re probably not expecting it too. What it does feel like is an authentic reimagining of a classic form factor.</p>

<p>It is equipped for more than just Game Boy games though, and the Rockchip RK3566 chipset and the central controls of a D-pad, four face buttons, four shoulder buttons and two inset analogue sticks at the bottom, make it ideal for emulation up to, and including, N64, Dreamcast, PSP and PlayStation.</p>

<p>They’re not the best analogue sticks in the world; not in terms of their actual functionality, but because they’re pretty deeply inset to allow the clamshell to close. They also sit at the foot of the device, which can become pretty tiring for your hands, depending on how you’re holding the Flip. It’s nice to have them though, and they do work well, but I’ve found myself mostly gravitating to the excellent-feeling D-pad, and the console generations that still focused their efforts on them.</p>
<p>Overall comfort is, however, very good. The light plastics make this an easy device to hold for long periods of time, and I do find that I prefer the narrow profile of systems like the Miyoo Flip, Trimui Brick or the classic Game Boy systems, when it’s a smaller device. If you liked the form factor of the Game Boy Advance SP, then.. this is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>The screen is a 3.5mm IPS LCD display with a 640×480 resolution, and it’s bright and colourful with plenty of clarity and decent viewing angles. It’s not ultra-high resolution, but the 4:3 scale means that this is a great device for playing classic titles, whether revisiting favourites like Super Mario World or Guardian Heroes, or checking out titles you haven’t found time to pull out of the cupboard in years. It does mean that PSP games suffer though, with large black bars above and below the wider aspect output. That’s a shame with a system that can readily play the games, but an easy concession given the form factor.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this is the perfect device for revisiting your Game Boy Advance library. Given that it has to be one of my all-time favourite handhelds, that’s a huge benefit, and with the cannily crafted form factor, the Miyoo Flip is a pure shot of nostalgia. No, it’s not a perfect integer scaled resolution for the GBA, but it’s more than good enough to enjoy these games.</p>
<p>Miyoo included both the original and the revised operating software during our review period, and the updated OS made interacting with the Flip just that much easier. It’s simple, clear and straightforward, and while it is more stripped back than some offerings, it runs flawlessly, though I’m pretty certain I’ve heard that background music before. You do also have the option of running EmulationStation if that’s your preferred launcher, and you can opt for a range of its glitzier frontends if you prefer, though it may take a bit more tinkering to get everything working.</p>
<p>There’s a few handy quality of life inclusions here, not least the appearance of a Mini-HDMI out, a second USB-C socket for attaching a wired controller and two Micro SD card slots for adding even more storage. Thanks to that, this is a tiny device that’s capable of holding pretty much every game made up until 2000 and playing them, and that’s pretty special.</p>

<p>Some early builds of the Miyoo Flip were criticised for the build quality of the hinge, but in this V2 iteration it feels rock solid, unleashing a satisfying and solid click every time you open it, and moving through the three different viewing angles. Beyond that, the 3,000 mAh battery is suitable, if not stellar, and you’re going to get a good five to seven hours out of it depending on the games you’re emulating.</p>
<p>You are paying a slight premium for this form factor, with some serious competition from the standard Game Boy-evoking Trimui Brick that certainly feels more solid in your hand, but doesn’t have any analogue sticks, despite having similar processing power to the Miyoo Flip. The overall experience is much slicker with the Flip than budget retro handhelds like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/">Boyhom R36H</a>, but it should be when the Flip costs twice as much.</p>

		<p>As we get to another Friday and the weekend beckons once more, I get to annoy the whole team by asking them over the same question I ask every week: what have you played? I’ve played a few different things this week, though Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma keeps taking my time while I build up all my villages and try to make all the characters my friends. Other than that, I was able to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/formula-legends-preview-an-arcade-racing-love-letter-to-f1/">Formula Legends</a>, which looks like it’ll be a great arcade racer.</p>

<p>Firstly, a little note to say congratulations to Ade and Jim, whose <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History Kickstarter project</a> achieved its funding this week! We can’t wait to read it!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played a little Destiny 2, lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">Death Stranding 2</a>, and started Atomfall. Speaking of the latter, he says, “It’s not as shooty as I would like there’s a lot of wandering around and sneaking. Also I have a big problem with the way it gives you quests. It puts markers on the map where to go but you have to manually add a marker to track it when running about. Stupid game, either give quest locations or don’t!”</p>


<p>TC’s adventures in games continued, but he didn’t get on with Starship Troopers, telling us, “I just fired up Starship Troopers. And then turned it off again. Looking down your sights on a gun means the gun – and I’m not exaggerating here – takes up almost a quarter of the screen. Blocks out a huge area so you can’t see what your shooting at. Who on earth designed that game???” Here’s hoping he finds something he likes to play this week.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a very nostalgic week, continuing his Metroid series run through taking in the “excellent” fan-made AMR2, saying, “It’s a worthy alternative to Nintendo’s own Samus Returns (although the latter is probably more akin to where they went with Dread) and the seminal Super Metroid.” He continues, “The SNES game is rightfully lauded, but there are a few too many crucial paths hidden in places that seem wilfully obtuse. I also finished a run of Lost in Random: The Eternal Die and may well carry on to try and unlock all the relics etc. Finally I finished the neat Crypt Custodian, started Recore as my daily Xbox Rewards game and got deep into the world of Gex for an upcoming review.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has been playing pretty much only JRPGs, telling us, “They give me the happy brain chemicals that I’m not getting anywhere else! I’ve been jumping back and forth between the incredible Metaphor ReFantazio and the recent HD Remaster release of Bravely Default (one of my all-time favourite games).”</p>
<p>I think <strong>Nic</strong> is probably planning an intervention for Reu after hearing that, but maybe he’s been distracted by playing Final Fantasy MTG. He told us, “This set is sweet as hell. I’m going to be so sad when it’s not the current set in a few weeks time”.</p>

<p>Giving in and buying a Switch 2, <strong>Jason&nbsp;</strong>started off by working through the 50CC category of Mario Kart World to test out some of the new stuff and get a vibe for it all. He also showed off the free roam to his kids so they could see the dinosaurs. Besides that, he’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, and a bit of Atlas Fallen too.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Chaos The Game, aka Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins. He says, “The combat has been fun but this game just throws loot at you and that can be overwhelming. The story is a bit mad too but I do like how Jack has no time for long speeches and spiels. Particularly liked when a villain was introducing themselves and he just said I don’t give a fuck who you are and punched him.” Top-tier Final Fantasy dialogue right there.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> finished Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 this week, and said, “Whilst the combat never quite clicked for me, the storyline was majestic, with some stellar plot twists that compelled me to see it through to its satisfying conclusion’. That’s not all because he also indulged in som sci-fi co-op action,&nbsp; “I also completed Revenge of the Savage Planet with Laura, and we enjoyed it! The balmy plot left us totally baffled but all the co-op metroidvaniaing was top-notch entertainment.”</p>

<p>Speaking of <strong>Laura</strong>, welcome to our newest writer, who only vaguely admitted to knowing Ade. She told us, “I started playing Atomfall this week, after watching Ade play it and getting itchy fingers when he didn’t play it the way I wanted it to be played! He told me I should get a baseball bat. So in true “independent woman” style, I levelled up and got myself a spiked baseball bat instead! I also completed my first TSA review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/rooftops-alleys-review/">Rooftops &amp; Alleys</a>, in which I spent most my time doing flips and landing on my noggin. Good times!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been chipping away at Split/Second, saying, “It’s still proving equal parts fun and challenging. Before moving onto the next big game from my backlog I decided to finally play through Limbo – I’m super curious what the team at Playdead having been making after all these years.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> as usual, who’s been able to dip back into FBC: Firebreak and continues to find it a rather unusual riff on the co-op shooter, shared some thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and has had a sudden urge to rewatch the Stargate movie…</p>
<p><em>And finally, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>
