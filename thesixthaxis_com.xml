			<p>In an era of reboots, remasters, and endless rumours of new and old Resident Evil games, it’s refreshing to look past the noise and play an actual game whilst you wait for the latest shenanigans of the Umbrella Corporation. There’s plenty of indie counterparts these days, whether they’re looking to reinvent the genre or pay strict homage to the classics.&nbsp;The Mute House is very much in the latter category as it is very much Resident Evil by the numbers. This isn’t as damning as it may sound though, as I am always in the mood for some spooky mansion action.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mute House | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhK6vmpRJ-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most impressive thing about The Mute House is how polished the game feels considering it is the work almost entirely of a solo developer. There is some excellent use of Unreal assets (all credited) and a clear understanding of just what makes the genre work. The level design, puzzles, and combat are all first rate with only a few minor niggles leading to some frustration.</p>


<p>Alongside being a very faithful take on Resident Evil’s style and design, The Mute House is also a return to the more hardcore nature of the early games. There are no initial difficulty settings here and the intended experience is challenging in a way that reminded me of my teenage days grappling with the first Resi game on PS1.</p>
<p>You begin by playing as Amber, a young woman lost in the woods on her way back from a night out. Immediately you are thrust into a chase scene as a ‘maniac’ is following her. Amber soon finds herself taking shelter in a cabin near a mysterious mansion. The relief is short-lived, however, as this is just the beginning of her nightmare. Cut to a week later and Amber’s elder sister, Emily, a local cop is investigating her disappearance. Upon entering the mansion, the entrance is sealed behind her and her quest begins.</p>


<p>At first glance the mansion is almost a carbon copy of the original Spencer Mansion even to the point of having a concealed door behind the staircase. The rest of the levels do find their own style though, and you’ll find yourself navigating a cemetery and sinister gatehouse before you have any chance of finding Amber.</p>
<p>Navigation is familiar genre fare, with perfectly implemented tank controls and inventory management being the name of the game. One big departure from other games in the survival horror genre, though, is also perhaps the most controversial aspect here – there is no map function whatsoever. This could be a deliberate move to increase the hardcore aspect but it does take some getting used to, especially once you start unlocking shortcuts and alternative paths around the mansion. I can see the appeal of this in a second playthrough (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/dead-of-darkness-review-terror-from-the-top-down/">Dead of Darkness</a> has an achievement for not checking the map) but it did lead to some annoying backtracking at times. The ideal situation is to play through in one sitting, but the 5 or 6 hour initial playtime makes this difficult.</p>

<p>Combat plays a significant role here, with the narrow corridors in many areas not being conducive to dodging the zombies and mutated monsters that you will face. Initially you’re restricted to your police issue handgun which is fine, but soon becomes underpowered. Once you find a shotgun it will become your main go-to, although ammo management is an issue for much of the game. This area could do with some rebalancing as zombies taking 8 or 9 shots to die makes the pistol barely usable when a single shotgun shell will do the trick. I ended the game with around a dozen clips in storage and others left in the environment.</p>
<p>Inventory management is another key survival horror staple that The Mute House takes and gives a distinctive hardcore twist. Rather than the magically linked item boxes that are typical for the genre, the shelves here only act as local storage, so you need to remember where you put things and return for them. This was another aspect that took me a while to get used to, so entrenched was the usual approach, but there are a couple of centrally located shelves to work with and nowhere near the deluge of items that are in other titles. In fact, aside from some key items you’ll only need to juggle health restoration and your weapons and ammo. This, however, is also made more difficult by the odd decision not to allow item stacking. This means that each clip or box of shells is a single item and reloading with partial clips drops the bullets already in the pistol.</p>

<p>Equally central to the world of survival horror are puzzles, and The Mute House has a nice mix of key finding, item use, and some more involved environmental ones. I was especially impressed by an audio-based puzzle that required you to memorise a tune and play sections of it in the correct order, and an Indiana Jones-like floor tile puzzle that requires you to take notes from five different pictures throughout the game. The latter was less exciting the fourth and fifth time I had to repeat it though as it preceded an instant death boss encounter with no save point in between, despite there being a room in which one would have worked.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Mute House is one of the most faithful survival horror experiences currently available and is highly recommended for any fans of the genre. While clear in its influences, it also has some new ideas of its own. They don't entirely come off, but I appreciate the distinct vision at play here and once you take the game on its own terms you are set for a memorable time. I just don’t think I ever want to do that tile pattern puzzle again!	</p></div>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and Fae Farms developer Phoenix Labs has announced that they are laying off “the majority of the studio”, leaving the future of their two games seriously in doubt.</p>
<p>On a post to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn</a>, the studio writes:</p>


<p>Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.</p>
<p>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</p>

<p>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals – they are some of the best in the business.</p>
<p>The company had previously made significant cuts last year, with layoffs and project cancellations in May 2024 that were estimated to affect around 140 employees.</p>
<p>Our thoughts naturally go out to all of those now affected by these further layoffs, and we hope that, as dire as the games industry is looking right now, they’re able to find fresh work soon.</p>
<p>This latest announcement would suggest that ongoing development for Dauntless and Fae Farm will be seriously affected, and it remains to be seen if and how the company plans to support them going forward.</p>
<p>Dauntless was the studio’s biggest hit getting its full launch in 2019 and able to ride the wave of interest in the Monster Hunter formula. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/25/dauntless-review-2020-switch-ps4-xbox-mobile/">Dauntless review</a>, we said, “Although hardly original in its premise, Dauntless offers an extremely fun and accessible take on the monster-hunting roleplaying game. It wastes no time in throwing you straight into the action and while easy to pick up there’s plenty of depth there for fans of the genre. What’s more Dauntless is completely free to play, gracefully sidestepping those annoying monetisation pitfalls we’re so used to seeing.”</p>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s Early Access launch has felt a bit like trying to drive British roads over the last couple of years. There’s more potholes than you can shake a stick at, an endless string of road works as water pipes burst and need emergency repairs, as alt nets dig trenches for their own fibre networks, and more. Kunos Simulazioni’s games are lauded as some of the best driving and racing sims out there, but on day one that’s coming with more than a few rough edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, that’s exactly what Early Access is for. It’s there to let developers release early with a subset of content, an acceptance of bugs and issues, and a preview of what’s to come through a roadmap of updates. Even so, Assetto Corsa Evo has stalled at the starting line on some of its key features.</p>


<p>It’s a tale that’s practically as old as online gaming: server issues. Assetto Corsa Evo is planned to be an always online game, tying progression through the career, car unlocks and more to being logged in, much like we see in Gran Turismo 7. While this can be nominally justified to preserve the integrity of a game’s experience when seeing other players, when the servers don’t work (whether that’s launch day overloading or at the inevitable shutdown sometime in the next decade), it locks off major parts of the game. In Assetto Corsa Evo’s case, it meant the first batch of 20 cars was initially locked down to just 5 on day one, until Kunos hurriedly patched the game to make all cars available without the nascent career and driving academy.</p>
<p>Online features are now being separately stress tested through specific beta builds and time windows, working to build it back into the main branch of the game as soon as possible.</p>


<p>That’s far from the only issue at this point, with bugs in setting up racing wheels –&nbsp;though immediately recognised, there’s no obvious preset for my Fanatec CSL Elite and McLaren wheel, and I had to disable other controllers to have it recognised – some complaints over performance with the initial release, a general clunky sluggishness to the menus and making adjustments, and odd choices like listing each car’s livery as though it’s a separate vehicle.</p>
<p>A lot of that can and will be fixed over time, so it’s great to see that the main thing that matters – the physics and handling of the cars – is as accomplished and enjoyable as ever. There’s a good spread of cars included in this initial Early Access launch, from road cars (well, sporty versions of road cars like the Abarth 695 Biposto version of the souped-up Fiat 500) through to a Mercedes GT2. There’s no sign of the GT3 cars that were the star of Assetto Corsa Competizione, so there’s fewer apples-to-apples comparisons to make there.</p>
<p>Cars are generally rather grippy, and you can really get some of the heft that is inherent to the chunkier road cars in the game, like the BMW M4 CSL. At the same time, there’s Brands Hatch and Laguna Seca in the game from the off, both tracks with iconic precipitous drops that give you that stomach-dropping sense of lift as you try to go through them, and you really feel that through both the force feedback and the visuals, the weight of the car moving around through the corner.</p>

<p>The foundations are there, but there’s still plenty of work for Kunos to do for the simulation and the surrounding racing experience. The force feedback can be a bit inconsistent – not least because it sometimes doesn’t want to activate for the wheel – the AI when racing is not the most engaging and a bit dim. The graphics engine also comes off as nice and accomplished, this being a new self-developed engine from Kunos, instead of Unreal Engine as was used in Assetto Corsa Competizione.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Assetto Corsa EVO, both in terms of Kunos quickly racing to fix up the initial release of the game with online servers, career and events, and the path ahead to the full launch. Some of the biggest draws are some way off into the future, with things like the open world Eifel freeroam region around the Nurburgring, and the essential online multiplayer still to come.</p>
<p>As it stands, then, Assetto Corsa EVO is not yet an essential buy. It’s got a cut price for the Early Access launch, so it’s tempting to grab the game now and dabble with it, but as usual, you’ll also need to accept that it’s a rough draft – and rougher than expected at this point in time. It might not take too long, but there will be a wait for this to start to realise its potential.</p>
