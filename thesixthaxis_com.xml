		<p>Velan Studios has released Midnight Murder Club into early access, their dark room party game twist on a first person shooter now available for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The game comes in at $19.99 / £15.99, but also has a generous Guest Pass, allowing an owner of the game to bring in a full lobby of buddies using a free Guest Pass version of the game. As a multiplayer game being published by PlayStation, players will require a free PSN account on PC, and an active PS Plus subscription to play on PS5.</p>

<p>Midnight Murder Club takes the first person shooter and drops it into the pitch-black rooms of Wormwood Manor. Up to six players enter this blacked-out arena with just a revolver and a flashlight, trying to figure out where the other players are from the sound of their movement, flickers of light and sparing use of the flashlight. This could find a niche within the social deduction genre, and could be a hit with Twitch streamer groups because of this.</p>
<p>There’s five game modes in the game as of its early access launch, as described by Velan Studios:</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Free-for-All</strong> – Six brave souls enter the mansion, and the player with the most kills when time runs out prevails among the rest.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Thief in the Night</strong> – Three fearless teams of two scour the mansion for valuable skulls to deposit into a vault. When the last vault closes, the team with the most value accumulated wins.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> – Kill-or-be-killed with your team in a murderous stand-off.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Head Hunters</strong> – Two friends become foes as they hunt the remaining four players as they try to find and burn three hidden demonic totems in the haunting halls.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">New Game Mode: <strong>Wildcards</strong> – Valiant attendees will play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways! From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side! Then, when the dust settles and the match is over, you’ll be gifted brand new cards to add to your collection giving you even more ways to change the game.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about this release is how Velan is opening the door to as many players as possible. Only one person needs to buy and own the game in order to host a full lobby, thanks to the free Guest Pass version of the game. It’s a similar concept to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction’s</a> Friends Pass, or games with DLC that allows DLC-havers to invite DLC-have-nots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, Midnight Murder Club has full cross-play and cross-progression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Velan has also laid out what can be expected through Early Access with a dev diary roadmap:</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club Dev Diary - Early Access Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXZgyRQv16M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">A new PvE mode is planned to release this spring, for example, while the summer will see more Toys added, as well as custom game modes. All of this is subject to change, though, depending on how the game’s community grows and feeds back on what they like and want more of in the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this game Velan Studios is establishing a track record of cooking up new and inventive multiplayer games. A few years ago they launched <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/31/hands-on-the-knockout-city-cross-play-beta/">Knockout City</a>, a quirky riff on dodgeball that was rather fun and vibrant, but sadly didn’t quite find its audience under the EA Originals publishing arm, and couldn’t recover <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/knockout-city-is-going-free-to-play-and-leaving-ea-behind-velan-self-publishing/">after going independent and free-to-play</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">shutting down in 2023</a>. Here’s hoping Midnight Murder Club strikes a cord with more people!</p>

		<p>Where do you go after ten years as a live service game? That’s the question that’s been hanging over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> for the last few years. The game is fully formed with plenty of maps, more spec ops characters than it’s wise to shake a stick at, and a mature esports scene that still surrounds it. Rainbow Six Siege X is Ubisoft’s answer, a major update and overhaul to the game coming in June 2025.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is an attack on two fronts. On the one hand, this is a deep technical uplift that’s aiming to refine the core experience, add some new options for gameplay and make this game feel a bit more 2020s than 2010s, and on the other, there’s Dual Front, a new game mode that looks to make the most of having ‘Six’ in the game’s name.</p>
<p><iframe title="R6 Siege X: New Dual Front 6v6 Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/li443iqd3Xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s start with the glitz and excitement that a new mode offers. Dual Front is a new permanent mode for the game, taking the core attack-and-defence gameplay and expanding it into something much more freeform and dynamic. This is a 6v6 mode, instead of the usual 5v5, and it tasks you with attacking and defending at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s just the tiniest hint of MOBA to this idea, in a concentrated form, as the map has two lanes – one dedicated that you can attack down and one that you need to defend –&nbsp;with the goal to capture each sector in turn and eventually neutralise the opposition base. Both teams have a practically identical experience, with the map a mirror image, though with one side having a run-down red brick look and the other a more renovated feel so that it’s possible to read where you are.</p>


<p>It’s a big map, with each sector feeling like a half or two-thirds sized version of a Siege map, still giving plenty of room for different attack options for the randomised objective placement. In the middle there’s then a neutral zone, an area where assignments can appear, such as a hostage rescue, giving you a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>The juggling act for your team is whether to prioritise attack or defence, trying to figure out and counter whatever it is that the opposition is doing at the same time. The mode is still very restricted and constrained in similar ways to the rest of Rainbow Six Siege, so you can only attack sectors one at a time, and only after the defenders have had some time to prepare. There’s also a bit of a catch up mechanic, so if one team pulls ahead, then the other team needs less time to plant and capture a zone.</p>

<p>It’s a really interesting concept, but it’s initially quite a messy one without an established team around you. It feels like there’s less room for freelancing here, as you do need to coordinate the balance between attack and defence, and to construct a sensible mix of operators. Each season will have a curated pool of operators to choose from, but there’s a mix of attacking and defending characters, giving a wider set of gadgets and abilities to use.</p>
<p>What will be important is how Ubisoft take this foundation and continue to push it forward over the coming seasons and years. Alongside Dual Front, Siege X is also bringing big changes to the underlying game engine and features. Stay tuned for those in around an hour…</p>
