<p>The Age of Bhaarat takes us to Ancient India and it is a world filled with legends, myths, and monsters. What we know is that players take on the role of a Forest Guardian of Anandpur and they must defend Bhaarat, which is another name for India, from the invasion of the Rakshasa demons. Players will have access to traditional Indian weapons, artifacts, a grapple hook to navigate, and the mystical powers that are imbued within the forest. The landscapes of The Age of Bhaarat are taken from Indian epic tales, with these places open to exploration to learn more about Indian mythology. The game will feature choices for players to make which could tip the scales that will either save the world from the demon invasion, or doom it. You will be able to explore Bhaarat alone or party up and fight together in co-op. Going by the trailer it currently seems limited to two player co-op, but we do not know if that is the final number.</p>
<p>There is currently no release date for The Age of Bhaarat and it is only confirmed for PC at the moment. You can wishlist the game at the following links:</p>
