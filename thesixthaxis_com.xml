		<p>Sales of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> did not initially seem good. In&nbsp;Square Enix’s May 2024 financial report, company president Takashi Kiryu stated that PS5 sales of <i>the game “</i>fell below expectations”, making players worried about the third and final chapter of the game.</p>
<p>Worry no longer as director Naoki Hamaguchi has spoken and said that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will be of the same standard. Speaking to Automaton he said “The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/01/30-upcoming-pc-games-for-2025/">PC</a>. I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment.”</p>


<p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely,” he adds. “A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.”</p>
<p>“For new players discovering Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 or Xbox Series X|S, I’d love for you to first enjoy that experience, and then also play the second game when it launches, while anticipating the third instalment,” he concludes.VII</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 has yet to get an official title and does not have a release date, but if it has the same sort of development length as the first two chapters, it should be out in 2027.</p>

<p>We scored the second title a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">winning 9/10</a> in our review.&nbsp; “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love,” said Nic. “It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>

		<p>Your choices for ethical gaming are getting slimmer by the day as it looks like EA is the next big video game firm to be swallowed up by the gigantic Silver Lake Management, which is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Also taking a stake will be Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, you may recognise that name as he is Trump’s son-in-law.</p>
<p>News of the takeover surfaced Friday afternoon, causing EA shares to surge 15%, valuing the company at around &nbsp;$48 billion. Nothing has been finalised as of yet but the deal could be announced as early as next week and would be one of the biggest industry takeovers of the year.</p>


<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund already owns 10% of Electronic Arts and&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">all of Niantic</a>., It also has stakes in Riot Games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Activision Blizzard</a>, Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Take Two,</a> Capcom, Embracer, Nexon, and <span data-complete="true">Koei Tecmo. The fund has earmarked $38 billion to be invested in video game companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Electronic Arts had a poor start to the year as sales of their annual football game were lower than expected, but things have bounced back with “better-than-expected contributions” across its portfolio. The general consensus from previews is that their next game, Battlefield 6, is going to be very good and should sell well.</p>
