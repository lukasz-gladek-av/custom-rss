		<p>Gearbox has put the spotlight on the beefcakiest of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> Vault Hunters, Amon the Forgeknight, showing off the character’s axe chucking abilities and role as the frontline tank of the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Amon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lCbxjy0zI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Forgeknight, Amon can draw upon drones to quickly craft the weapons and gear that he needs. This includes a Forgehammer to smash enemies with, Forgeaxes to throw at and slice enemies, a Forgeshield to soak up damage, and more.</p>
<p>These Action Skillsdepend on which of the three skill trees you’ve levelled up, though, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucible (Cybernetics skill tree) – Wield the elemental might of fire and ice with Amon’s twin Forgeaxes, which deal Incendiary or Cryo damage by default, have multiple charges, and can be picked up to reduce their cooldown. The Forgeaxes make any damaged target Primed, causing them to explode in a damaging, bloody mess when killed.</li>
<li>Scourge (Vengeance skill tree) – Charge headlong into the fray as Amon summons his Forgeshield, which will soak up incoming damage and fill up a Vengeance Meter. Once you’ve absorbed the brunt of the incoming hurt, you can return the favor by firing back a Forgewave that consumes Vengeance to deal freezing Cryo damage.</li>
<li>Onslaughter (Calamity skill tree) – Wallop your foes in the face with Amon’s Forgefist, which dashes to your target to unleash an explosive Rocket Punch. The force of this Incendiary Melee Damage impact will Stagger most enemies, leaving them dazed so you can finish them off with a flurry of bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/amon/">view each tree in depth here</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. Amon’s Forgeskill trait gives him a secondary Action Skill, which comes with a separate cooldown, so you can really bounce back and forth between them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Edge (Crucible Action Skill equipped) – Throw a twinned Forgeaxe, dealing Cryo Damage to enemies it passes through and returning to Amon, dealing Incendiary Melee Damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Firewall (Scourge Action Skill equipped) – Deploy a Firewall that absorbs enemy projectiles, and grants friendly projectiles that pass through it increased damage and velocity. Absorbed damage is converted into Vengeance if Scourge is active, and enemies near Firewall get burned with Incendiary damage over time.</li>
<li>Molten Slam (Onslaughter Action Skill equipped) – Slam a Molten Forgehammer into the ground, dealing Incendiary damage to enemies in a large area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amon is the third character that Gearbox has released a deep dive on, following on from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/vex-spotlight/">Vex the Siren</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/rafa-spotlight/">Rafa the Exo-Soldier.</a> There’s just Harlowe the Gravitar to go, which will doubtless be coming soon, what with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">Borderlands 4’s release date being set for 12th September</a>. There’s not much time left!</p>

		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is kicking off Season 3 with the build up to the&nbsp;FedExCup Playoffs, but what’s this? You can now be a magician?</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Season 3 Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZXz5V3IkMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well kind of. Instead of pulling rabbits out of bunkers, making golf balls come out of people’s ears or drawing endless linked handkerchiefs out of your pocket, this is a new playing archetype. The Magician is a player type that’s able to get out of sticky situations, with the featured pro players that exemplify this being Max Homa, and the “World’s Greatest Golfer” Chris McDonald.</p>
<p>Through Season 3, players that choose this archetype will have specific quests to try to complete, and then once their MyPlayer character has reached an OVR of 85, they’ll learn the Recovery shot type.</p>
<p>Regardless of your player type, Season 3 of PGA TOUR® 2K25, is all about the FedExCup playoff championships, including the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind and the TOUR Championship at East Lake Golf Club. There’s themed quests and ranked tour events that will take place through the season as well, and alongside new apparel and equipment in the PGA Tour Superstore, the Wear and Earn event will boost VC earnings to help you afford it.</p>

<p>There’s also the Challenges mode, which adds new skill-based challenges with rewards, new themed maps that will be added through the season, and Clubs can now be upgraded to Diamond Tier to let you improve your kit even further. A new free and premium Clubhouse Pass is also available, including the Lob Shot, which can be unlocked for free by reaching Tier 25.</p>
<p>We had a good time with this latest iteration of HB Studios’ golf game, with Nick saying, “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet. There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

		<p>Fortnite is becoming a bug-riddled mess these days… but not in a bad way. No, Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome has littered the Battle Royale Island with bugs as part of The Hive, and is tasking you with joining the O.X.R. (Onimorph eXtermination Rangers) to blast them all away.</p>
<p>And who better to blow up some bugs than UNSC Spartans from the Halo franchise, and the Power Rangers?</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGqbypEMcVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New for the Battle Royale Island are some locations themed after this battle, with the OXR HQ there to dish out orders and sell you weapons, while the Ranger’s Ruin is a former OXR weapons lab that has now been overrun. You’ll face off against Swarmers, Bombers, and burrowing Queens, grabbing new weapons like the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver and a&nbsp;Bug Cannon, and getting to the Hammerhead Choppa to rain fire down from above.</p>
<p>It’s all tied together by the new Battle Pass. Purchasing the pass auto-unlocks the UNSC Spartain, while progression will get you the Green Ranger and, from 16th September, you’ll be able to complete quests to unlock a&nbsp;Dino Megazord Outfit.</p>

<p>Also in the Battle Pass are <span>Yoo-mi, </span><span>Agent Patch, </span>Battle Gamer Mae, Lt. Ripp Slade, and the totally not just a panda version of Nick Fury, Onyx Winter</p>
<p>The rest of the Power Rangers will be kept for a Mighty Morphin Bundle that will hit the Shop in August and includes Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Blue Ranger Outfits.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has revealed the fifth and final game that will be included with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-party-pack-11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a> later this year, with Cookie Haus a drawing game that will be sure to be a hit with sweet-toothed artists out there.</p>
<p>Cookie Haus is a cozy drawing game where you decorate cookies to match the prompts, adding layers of icing and sprinkles to match prompts like “a cookie who’s <em>seen</em> some things.” Once cookies have been created, you can then name them and the group you’re playing with with then vote on their favourites &nbsp;for each prompt.</p>
<p><iframe title="The final game in Party Pack 11 is..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb0p6mUjApM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The core thing that sets Cookie Haus apart from our other drawing games is that the drawing interface is built from the ground up to feel very physical,” said Director Chase McClure. “There is something about placing icing and sprinkles on a cookie that makes it more familiar to someone who doesn’t consider themselves an ‘artist.’ But, it also gives this whole new challenge to the Drawful veterans of the group.”</p>

<p>Also included in Jackbox Party Pack 11 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspectives</strong> – There’s been a crime, one player secretly did it, and the evidence comes from your own survey answers! Study the clues, defend your innocence (even if you’re lying), and put your friends on trial.</li>
<li><strong>Doominate</strong> – Take all that is perfectly lovely and destroy it in a head-to-head joke game where the funniest answer is exalted.</li>
<li><strong>Legends of Trivia</strong> – Are you looking for a fantasy trivia game with RPG-inspired elements? Oh boy, do I have some good news for you!</li>
<li><strong>Hear Say</strong> – In Hear Say, you’ll be putting your pipes to work to create hilarious soundscapes. Use your phone as a controller, just like all Jackbox party pack games. But in this one, you get to use the microphone on your phone to get real sound effects that work in the game!</li>
</ul>
