<p>The full details of the Stellaris Season 9 expansion are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>BioGenesis Expansion (May 5, 2025): Take command of the forces of life itself in BioGenesis. Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars?</em></li>
<li><em>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025): The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever- present temptation of ultimate destruction.</em></li>
<li><em>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025): Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy. Will your empire thrive in the heat, or be consumed by the very forces it seeks to command</em></li>
<li><em>Stargazer Species Portrait (available now): Dream of the stars with this exclusive portrait, available immediately upon purchasing the Season 09 Expansion Pass. Featuring three phenotypes and unique animations, the Stargazer Species Portrait is perfect for players who seek to embody the spirit of cosmic curiosity.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside the release of the BioGenesis Expansion will be the free Stellaris 4.0 “Phoenix update, and this will rework the Trade experience as well as adding new population and workforce groups. There has been some controversy around the development of recent Stellaris content, when Paradox Interactive confirmed it was using generative AI for in game assets, including the voice of an AI character.</p>
