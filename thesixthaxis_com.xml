		<p>His many personal faults notwithstanding, H.P. Lovecraft’s writings continue to cast a profound shadow over the horror genre. While his own views were reprehensible (even by the standard of his time) the continuing fascination with cosmic horror can be seen across many media. Big Bad Wolf are the latest developers to take influence from this mythos in their upcoming horror adventure game Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, but have moved away from the beaches of Innsmouth and out to sea to take advantage of the thalassophobia (fear of deep water) that underlines much of Lovecraft’s work.</p>

<p>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss begins in 2053 with you playing as Noah, an investigator charged with following the trail of a missing colleague who finds that an occult cosmic threat is spreading across the world. His investigations lead him to a mining facility located deep within the Pacific Ocean wherein he discovers that the missing miners have stumbled upon a passage to R’lyeh. So far, so Lovecraftian, and I was impressed by how well the content I played in the preview build slotted into the wider Mythos whilst also maintaining an identity of its own.</p>


<p>The Cosmic Abyss is played out through a first-person perspective, but this is no action shooter and combat plays no real role in this game. There were no direct engagements with enemies during the section I got to play, though there was still plenty of threat and dread. The full version promises some confrontations with unknown horrors that will require quickness of thought rather than trigger finger to survive. This fits perfectly with cosmic horror as no small part of the terror comes from your insignificance in the face of the unknowable.</p>


<p>With no combat to speak of, the gameplay mechanics instead revolve around investigation and puzzle solving, with a focus on a mind palace method of connecting clues that is reminiscent of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes games. In order to interact with the environment you can call on your AI companion, Key, who can scan, assess, and record the information that you acquire. This digital compendium can be called up in order to make connections between clues and objects that you scan, reveal deeper insights and even give you the direct solution to riddles.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered graphics are breathtaking at times, with the scale of the underwater environment being overwhelming. Relatively early on you have to venture outside of the submersed facility to explore a mysterious labyrinth and even though there was no pressure of oxygen limits in place I found the whole section almost unbearably tense. This wasn’t helped by my stubbornness in trying to brute force my way through when a more direct route via further investigations was the more efficient solution.</p>

<p>Major puzzles and obstacles in the world of The Cosmic Abyss will often have more than one solution with the main division between each being the effect they have on your sanity. Leaning into the world of R’lyeh for answers will drive you further into madness whereas presumably more rational and scientific solutions will help keep you sane. This mechanic was hinted at in the preview but I look forward to seeing its full effects in the full game.</p>
<p>As is often the case with early preview builds, there were a few small bugs and glitches, but these were refreshingly infrequent with the game just a couple months from release in April. One that took me a while to work out was that the controls would occasionally revert to AZERTY (to match the Big Bad Wolf’s keyboards as a French studio) so I couldn’t move forward. For a while I thought this was a deliberate effect in keeping with the classic Eternal Darkness’ manipulation of your controls, but checking with the team, it became clear that this was just a bug. Rebranding it as a feature wouldn’t be the worst idea, though!</p>

<p>The world of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss has certainly got its claws into me and I’m eagerly awaiting getting stuck into the full version when it launches in April. What I’ve seen so far promises a twisting and tense narrative that will challenge the grey cells rather than the trigger fingers and, as such, should be a truly cosmic horror experience.</p>

		<p>Hilltop Studios, the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lil-guardsman">Lil’ Guardsman</a>, have announced their next title, and it is a vast departure from the cute cartoony aesthetic of their breakthrough game. Curse of Resthaven is billed as an Eldritch time loop adventure and takes the form of a single–player narrative roguelite in which you must govern a cursed colony and decide who (or what) to trust.</p>
<p><iframe title="Curse of Resthaven | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JyiYqmQLt8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gaming loop involves a seven day structure, at the end of which the island is destroyed, only for a goddess to send you back to the beginning again. During each week loop you’ll need to carry out a range of activities to try and break the curse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncover the truth: Interrogate the townspeople, earn their trust, and discover their secrets. Question them wisely, and exploit your knowledge to gain new leverage.</li>
<li>Master the art of trade: Strike a deal with every merchant that visits Resthaven to gather resources and upgrade the colony, improving the lives of those you serve.</li>
<li>Explore a cursed island: Venture beyond the colony walls on branching, card-driven expeditions into the wilds. Build a deck of resource and companion cards to survive unpredictable encounters and confront eldritch horrors.</li>
<li>Trapped in a time loop: Each week-long cycle unlocks new advantages, new story paths, and deeper truths. Use what you have learned to discover Resthaven’s darkest secrets.</li>
<li>A hand-drawn world: Every character and environment is rendered in a unique graphic novel style, blending gothic intrigue with cosmic dread</li>
<li>The sound of mystery: Features more than 25 fully voiced characters and an original score from the composer of Lil’ Guardsman’s award-winning soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Despite being a radical shift from the cartoon world of Lil’ Guardsman, Curse of Resthaven builds on everything we learned making that game,” said Scott Christian, Studio Director at Hilltop Studios. “It’s evocative, story-rich gothic horror, like if Twin Peaks and Lost had an eldritch baby raised by Edgar Allen Poe. We want it to move people, spook them, and be a lot of fun to play.”</p>
<p>You can now add Curse of Resthaven to your wishlist on Steam.</p>
