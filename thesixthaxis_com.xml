		<p>11 bit studios has announced that Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September, bringing the city management sequel to consoles almost a year to the day after the PC release.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2’s console release was expected for this summer, having been included on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/frostpunk-2-is-coming-to-consoles-this-summer/">the game’s roadmap updates from 11 bit</a>. The next stop after the console launch is the Spectrum DLC, which they cryptically described as being able to “help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…” More expansions are then planned for 2026.</p>
<p>Another project for 11 bit is a remake of the frigid cult classic original, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/frostpunk-1886-has-been-announced-by-11-bit-studios/">Frostpunk 1886 announced at the game’s 7th anniversary</a> in April, promising to rebuild the game within Unreal Engine 5 and introduce some game mechanics from its sequel.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a> game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>
