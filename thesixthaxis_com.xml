		<p>It’s barely been out a day, but the internet has had its say on Elden Ring Nightreign, and it’s said, “Ooh missus, it’s a bit hard when I’m playing by myself.”</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are listening and have announced an upcoming patch that will include “improvements for solo expeditions”, specifically that “the effect “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat”, which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.” Additionally, the amount of runes gained will be increased.&nbsp;The Nightreign patch will also include the usual round of bug fixes and improvements,</p>


<p>From Software also revealed that they had sold 2 million copies of the game in a single day.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
