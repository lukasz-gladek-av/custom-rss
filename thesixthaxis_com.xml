		<p>Having announced Onimusha: Way of the Sword back in December with a teaser trailer, Capcom has turned up for the State of Play stream with the first real trailer for the classic franchise revival, showcasing the game’s protagonist: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 1st Trailer: Protagonist | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Ct29FeMak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set for launch sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay, featuring its “Issen” counterattack mechanics.</p>
<p>Way of the Sword takes us to Kyoto in the Edo period where the relative peace of this period has been broken by &nbsp;the infestation by the demonic Genma, transforming it into na eerie and unsettling place. A long samurai with the Oni Gauntlet will have to step into the darkness and battle the hellish enemies.</p>

<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though, and Capcom has also recently confirmed a remaster of Onimusha 2, coming out on 23rd May.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - Pre-Order Announcement Trailer&nbsp;| PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jZVwlMhAPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

		<p>Supermassive’s space horror adventure, and the next game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> is set to launch on 2nd October this year. Just in time for the spooky season!</p>
<p><iframe title="Directive 8020 - Story Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4a_VXgNSfME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As an alien organism that seems to be able to mimic other life invades a colony ship, you’ll have to try to find any way to survive that you can. This is one small step and a giant leap forward for the franchise, switching things up with persistent real-time threats, new stealth mechanics, and enhanced interactive cinematics. It’s all powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King.</p>
<p>Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>

<p>“Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. 12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>
<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror </strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats </strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>
</ul>

		<p>The first new game from Sony’s State of Play broadcast was revealed as Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, a title that looks like it owes a lot to the rather good Team Sonic Racing as you will racing across the ground, air and water.&nbsp; On top of that, you also get to zip through space and time as well, maybe Sonic’s blue car is made of a TARDIS.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66UrGKXhJNI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Race across land, sea, air, space, and time in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds! Warp through Travel Rings into new dimensions where something new awaits around every twist and turn. Speed to victory solo or as a team in a variety of offline and online modes and compete against players from around the world. Build the ultimate machine to match your racing style, unlock special skills to gain the upper hand, and unleash power-up items for the win!”</em></p>
<p>The trailer mentions a closed network test on February 21st, but the <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official site </a>does not have anyway to sign up just yet. </p>

<p>The game is coming to PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Switch, no mention of Switch 2 just yet.</p>

		<p>Sega shared a new trailer for their classic side-scrolling ninja series Shinobi. Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is coming out on 29th August for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ge__8Dan6bU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After rumours that Joe Musashi might appear in Lizardcube’s last big retro revival, Streets of Rage 4, the team has instead been given control of the series return instead.</p>
<p>“Play as Joe Musashi in a new 2D action platformer that marks the return of the iconic SHINOBI franchise,” reads the trailer blurb. “Battle challenging enemies and epic bosses in a uniquely hand-drawn world.”</p>
<p>It’s looking pretty tasty. We’ll share more details when we have them.</p>
