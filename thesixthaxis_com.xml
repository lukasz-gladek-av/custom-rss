		<p>We all have our favourite genres, but I’m not sure how many people would put tower defence at the top of their tier list. Those people are, of course, wrong, as tower defence games are often the perfect, brain-massaging mix of action, puzzling and sitting back to watch the carnage play out. And, they make you feel smart. So, we were definitely excited to catch the announcement for Atlanta TD, a brand new tower defence game coming to Steam Early Access in 2026. It helps, that this is one of the most beautiful tower defence games we’ve ever seen. </p>

<p>Atlanta TD has some serious 80s anime vibes going on, tying stunning pixel art to an art direction that pulls thematically from series like The Lost City of Gold and Ulysses 31. That immediately puts it straight to the top of my wishlist, but when you read into the storyline and setup, this is really a game that’s doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is a procedurally generated roguelite tower defence game set in Atlanta, where the Gods of Olympus must defend their home against the oncoming hordes of Ares’ armies. With Zeus fallen and the Four Spectacular Realms seemingly defenceless, you must call upon the remaining Gods to protect the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“While I was at university, I always had this idea to make a pixel art tower defence game – but outside of that idea, I could never really nail down the Unique Selling Point.” Shared lead developer Jake Meyer. “Shortly after graduating, I started a YouTube channel around game development which got a fair bit of attention – and while looking for a job, I thought I could start this project, release it within a year and document the entire process on YouTube – 3 years on, I think it’s safe to say how that turned out.</p>


<p>“I worked on this project in my spare time over a year and a half – building the idea, the design and the lore of Atlanta – before pitching it to Tin Man Games, who were in a transitional period from their previous project, and was extremely fortunate to have been able to work on it with them since then. We now have had an amazing team who have contributed to it to produce something bigger than I ever could have imagined – and seeing it get to this stage and feel so real is the most incredible feeling, and I am so excited for people to be able to play it!”</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is launching on Steam Early Access in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How many stories have you experienced in your lifetime? From picture books as a kid, to films, TV shows, novels, audiobooks, and videogames, do you have a rough number? Are we talking thousands? More? Well, let me tell you right now, amongst all those thousands upon thousands of stories you’ve experienced, you’ve never encountered a yarn quite like the tale that Dark Auction is telling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Auction - Story, Mystery &amp; Bidding Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9181j4NedQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially a visual novel with some – very – slight gameplay elements, Dark Auction follows protagonist Noah Crawford on a seemingly simple task of retrieving his father from an auction. Rather ominously though, Noah discovers that this auction is taking place in a spooky European-like castle in the middle of a mist-soaked woodland. The items being auctioned? Well, they belonged to ‘Dictator X’, who, to all intents and purposes, is Hitler. Noah is soon trapped in the castle with a bunch of other veritable inmates. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Each of them is a genuinely engaging character, with a lot of depth to uncover and fascinating motivations behind their actions and behaviours. They all feel like fully rounded personalities that you’ll want to get to know. Which is a very good thing, as most of your time in the game will be spent conversing with your fellow auctioneers. </p>


<p>Anyway, soon Noah is strong-armed by men wearing Parrot masks – yep, not making this up – to do their bidding. Literally their bidding, as much of Dark Auction takes place within an auction house. These scenes play out akin to the trials in the Phoenix Wright series. It is up to Noah to spot the errors in a character’s memories – it’s via memories, rather than money, that people place their bids and unlock the artefact they desire – and then attempt to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>Noah gathers the information he’ll need by slowing strolling around a handful of rooms, talking to NPC’s in an attempt to learn more about them, whilst adding ideas to his mental ‘word cloud’ – a handy mechanic that enables him to spot the inaccuracies during an auction testimony and provide the contradictory evidence. He does this not to attack the participants, but to support them, usually guiding them through a traumatic moment of their lives in the process.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like a bewildering hodgepodge of ideas, then that’s because, well, it is. Yet somehow all these disparate elements of the plot – Hitler, therapeutic auction sessions, parrot men, post-war Europe, trauma, heck, even time travel – meld together rather neatly. Offering a fresh, compelling and often rather tense narrative that will keep you clicking through reams of dialogue from beginning to end. Though with a story from the mind of Rika Suzuki – the writing talent behind Nintendo DS classics like the Another Code series and the superb noir-thriller Hotel Dusk: Room 215 – the fact that the narrative is uniquely brilliant is no real surprise.</p>
<p>Where Dark Auction struggles, then, is in its presentation. Visually, during the exploration phases, Dark Auction feels ancient. There are both 3D third-person and first-person elements, and these look and handle like one of the early Resident Evil remakes. Despite the simplicity, the frame rate on Nintendo Switch is lousy; character models are blocky and lack sufficient animation to give them any personality. The environments themselves are devoid of atmosphere and detail, often robbing the game of the tension that the scripted elements have worked so hard to build. </p>

<p>Outside of dialogue, far too much time is spent wandering into a room and being forced to look at every clue until the game allows you to leave again. It’s repetitive and feels like unnecessary padding, keeping you from getting to the good bit, such as the next surprising twist or informing reveal during an auction. The auctions themselves and the talking heads dialogue moments also benefit from losing the lousy 3D and going full 2D, all gorgeous character art and smooth flowing movements.</p>
