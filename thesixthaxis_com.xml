		<p>I love a good pun, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> is right up there with the best of them. I’ll be honest, when I first heard about and saw this game at Gamescom last year, the wordplay sailed right over my head in the moment, but when I got it, I&nbsp;<em>got&nbsp;</em>it, and can only applaud the masterful titling. I’m glad to see that the game has come together really well, too!</p>

		<p>Anyone buying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will not be getting the fullest, most complete version of the game. Nintendo has now confirmed that the Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC is not bundled in with the Switch 2 Edition release, whether phsyical, digital or upgrade, and will instead remain a separate purchase.</p>
<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC. That DLC is available as a separate purchase.”</p>


<p>Pricing has been a major bone of contention around the Nintendo Switch 2 release, and this will be another sour note for the Switch 2 Editions of a small selection of games. These upgraded versions of games can bring technical improvements and added content, but are premium upgrades that start at $10 for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">in contrast to free patches that will be made for other titles</a>. The two Zelda games included will, however, have their Switch 2 Edition upgrades made available through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Breath of the Wild’s Switch 2 Edition brings improved resolution and performance, support for HDR, an a new Zelda Notes feature for Nintendo Switch smartphone app. Sticking with USD for simplicity, that brings a $10 price hike over the original release, whether both afresh as a $70 game, or with a $10 upgrade cost. The Expansion Pass is then a further $20 on top.</p>
<p>The Expansion Pass DLC for Breath of the Wild features two DLC packs: The Master Trials, which added some new game modes with the Trial of the Sword challenge, Master Mode difficulty, and the Hero’s Path feature, and The Champion’s Ballad, which added a new dungeon, story content, gear, additional challenges and the Master Cycle Zero motorbike.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_and_splatoon_2_will_get_new_physical_releases_with_dlc_included_in_japan">a Japan-exclusive Expansion Pass edition of the game</a> which added the DLC onto the game card, there’s no Game of the Year edition, so it is most straightforward to keep the Switch 2 Edition purely for the new console upgrade. Nintendo has been very strict to maintain the price of their games over the Switch generation, and any newcomers are really seeing and feeling that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Nintendo has clarified</a> that physical Switch 2 Edition games will on Switch 2 cartridges and will not bundle a download code with an original Switch card.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has clarified that physical versions of Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> games will feature <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game cards, and will <em>not</em> be an original Switch card and a download code.</p>
<p>Various things have kicked up a storm in the wake of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, and one of the biggest bones of contention has been with regard to Switch 2 Editions upgrades of various games. Thanks to a mixture of ambiguous wording on Switch 2 Edition game packshots – see the gallery below – and erroneous statements by customer support, it was believed that Switch 2 Editions could be an original Nintendo Switch cartridge alongside an upgrade code to redeem at the Nintendo eShop.</p>


<p>We were caught up with this story as well, and apologise for the confusion.</p>

		
		

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition games – which includes upgrades for the likes of Breath of the Wild, Kirby and the Forgotten Lands and Super Mario Party Jamboree – will all be coming on the new red Switch 2 specific game cards. This means that they will not be usable with the original Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Third parties may make use of digital downloads in a box, or (while not explicitly stated) even the new Game Key cartridge, which acts as a digital license to download and play the game.</p>
<p>Of course, if you already have a game for Nintendo Switch, you will be able to purchase an upgrade via the eShop to get the added features and enhancements.</p>
<p>Switch 2 Editions are typically a mix of boosting game graphics and performance with a new build of the game for Switch 2 and added content. However, there are also a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>
