		<p>An internal memo from Sony has revealed they are to shut down Bluepoint Games, the developer responsible for the remasters of Shadow of the Colossus. Uncharted, and Gravity Rush on PS4, and the Demon Souls remake for PS5.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had been working on a live service game, but this was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-confirms-cancellation-of-live-service-projects-from-bend-studio-and-bluepoint-games">cancelled</a> in January 2025. Sony bought Bluepoint in 2021, and they have never released a game as a PlayStation studio, although they did work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a>.</p>


<p>Here is the email in full:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to share an important update from the Studio Business.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;Studios.&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghos</a>t<a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"> of Yotei</a></em>&nbsp;launched to critical and commercial success,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>&nbsp;further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em>&nbsp;continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p>
<p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p>
<p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for fiscal year 26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Hermen Hulst<br>
CEO, Studio Business Group</p></blockquote>
