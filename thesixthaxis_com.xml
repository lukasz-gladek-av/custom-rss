		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kojima-productions/">Hideo Kojima</a> is a busy man, Death Stranding 2 is hardly out of the door,&nbsp; he’s working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">OD, which is currently an Xbox exclusive</a>, and also Physint, which is currently a PlayStation exclusive. However, that doesn’t really mean these days and both titles may eventually end up on both formats.</p>
<p>Physint, a “next-generation action espionage game”, was announced in 2024. Kojima said it would go into full production after Death Stranding 2, but it is a long way off with Kojima <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-says-in-an-interview-with-a-french-magazine-that-the-death-stranding-movie-is-planned-for-2027-and-that-physint-will-take-him-5-or-6-years.1192278/">stating in May this year t</a>hat “It’ll take me another five or six years.”</p>


<p>Physint presumably means “Physical Interaction” but the logo is a little odd, the Y is clearly separate from the rest of the text. Kojima never does anything without a purpose, so it will be interesting to see what theories fans can come up with.</p>
<p>During a Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, which you can watch below, key artwork for Physint was revealed along with the first actors. Charlee Fraser, Ma Dong-seok and Minami Hamabe are all confirmed for the game, and I would suggest Ma Dong-seok, aka Don Lee, is the most recognisable, having starred in The Eternals, Train to Busan, and gamers will have met him as Samson in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike affected casting, so the main character has yet to be revealed, although that is “coming soon”.&nbsp; Looking at the artwork, some have suggested it might be Robert Patterson, but it looks rather more like Eddie Redmayne to me.</p>



<p>When the title was announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-action-espionage-game-after-death-stranding-2/">Kojima said</a> “I cannot tell you so much now… but we plan to bring together cutting-edge technology and talent from around the world to create it. Of course, it is an interactive game, but it is also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion and sound. With this title, we hope to transcend the barriers between film and video games.”</p>
<p>It has been revealed that 3Lateral are creating new technology to capture the likeness of the actors.</p>
<p>So, only six years to wait and I guess we’re all going to have to buy a new console to play it on as the PS6 should be out by then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>GameSir are my favourite controller manufacturer right now. The Chinese company have steadily built their reputation, year-on-year, and are now crafting controllers that are capable of besting Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, all while charging less. The GameSir G7 Pro continues that growth, but here they’ve aimed very specifically at the official Xbox Elite controller. Once again, GameSir have made a controller that is so good, and such incredible value, that other manufacturers should be ashamed to show their faces in public.</p>
<p>The GameSir G7 Pro isn’t so much inspired by the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 as it is GameSir peering over Microsoft’s shoulder, and thoroughly stealing their test answers. If you were glancing from across the room, you’d likely swear that it was an official Xbox release, especially as it’s designed for Xbox and PC, and comes with the Xbox button proudly sitting at the centre of the faceplate. Microsoft can’t be too upset about it, as they’ve certified the G7 Pro for their console.</p>



<p>The key thing, as has been the case with GameSir’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a>, is that they’ve packed in every single bit of tech you could want in a modern pro controller, while Microsoft’s official controllers are now lagging behind. In the box, you’re getting the G7 Pro, a colour-matched charging stand, a USB-C cable, and a selection of different D-pads to choose from, all with an RRP of £89.99.</p>
<p>Available in three different colourways, our review unit came in the understated Mech White colour, with a pure white body, silver hardware and grey rubberised grips. If you’re looking for something truly eye-catching though, you should check out the blue and gold Wuchang edition, which looks absolutely amazing, though you’re going to pay an extra £20 for it.</p>

<p>It’s a smart-looking controller then, and in your hands it feels absolutely rock solid. There’s a pleasing amount of heft, but at 272g it’s far easier on your hands and wrists than the fully loaded 345g of the Elite Series 2. The rubberised grips are comfortable and provide a decent level of grip, with the G7 performing well, even through the hot, sweaty days from the tail end of the summer.</p>
<p>The GameSir G7 Pro is absolutely stacked with features. You’ve got three different connection options, with 2.4GHz USB wireless, Bluetooth and wired modes for PC, while Xbox players have to opt for a wired connection. Mobile players can also grab the G7 Pro via Bluetooth, giving you a controller that’s capable of fulfilling a number of roles in a multi-platform home. There’s an easy-to-use toggle on the back of the controller for switching between wireless and Bluetooth, and it’s all very straightforward and user friendly.</p>

<p>The headline inclusions are Mag-Res TMR analogue sticks, which give you an even smoother experience than Hall Effect sticks, while retaining the drift-proof design that should really be the industry standard. They feel lovely under your thumbs, with a lightness to their movement that makes them feel effortless in use. They’re precise and utterly reliable, whether you’re playing competitive shooters like Overwatch 2 or involved in precision combat in Elden Ring: Nightreign. They are so good, you’ll wonder what’s going on with other controllers.</p>
<p>Alongside the sticks, you’re getting mechanical switches across the majority of other inputs. The four central face buttons, the D-pad, and the additional shoulder bumper buttons that sit alongside the regular shoulder buttons and triggers are all mechanical, emitting a glorious click with every press. They feel precise, and most importantly, fast.</p>
<p>As with the Cyclone 2, the trigger lockout shortens their movement, engaging a mechanical button instead, which can be the difference in a head-to-head battle between adding to your killstreak and embarrassment and defeat. It’s one of the best developments in controller tech, and the G7’s implementation is the best I’ve come across yet.</p>
<p>Turning the controller over, there’s just a bevy of controls, switches and toggles, but the two that are most important are the large back buttons that sit comfortably underneath your middle fingers. They feel responsive, but their smooth surface feels a little disconcerting next to the rubberised grip and mildly textured plastics that sit back there as well.</p>

<p>What’s particularly good about these pro buttons is the fact that they also come with their own lockout switch, which resolutely locks them in place, and prevents any accidental button presses. It’s so solid that you could utterly forget they’re there, were it not for the slightly odd quality of the surface.</p>
<p>Additional features include a 3.5mm headphone jack, which also features a microphone mute button, allowing you to mute the microphone if you’ve plugged in a headset that doesn’t have its own mute function. It’s a handy thing to jab at when someone in your house is asking you a question, but it’s mildly unnecessary, and the red LED inside it will bleed through to the right analogue stick when it’s activated. File it under ‘nice to have’.</p>
<p>In terms of competition, you’ve got to look to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2, though both renditions are more expensive, with the Core model losing out to the G7 Pro in terms of features and customisation options, while costing £125. The full-fat version takes things up to a stonking £170, but there’s more customisation there. Both Elite’s also let you tune the thumbstick tension too, but there continue to be a steady stream complaints over production quality with the line in terms of reliability, and the G7 Pro’s TMR sticks will likely outlast any of Microsoft’s current lineup.</p>

		<p>Kojima Productions has released a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox title OD, with the new teaser called OD Knock which is really rather creepy. Much of it is seen from a first person perspective, with the character walking into a room and lighting candles. It sounds fine but there is one candle in the shape of a baby and when it is lit you hear a baby cry. Another candle in the shape of a head bleeds when lit, plus there is the picture of the eye on the window that is watching everything unfold. That’s all before whatever is knocking on the door enters the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="OD - KNOCK Teaser Trailer - [ESRB] 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer does not give much away about what OD is, except it looks like it will be some kind of psychological horror with occult vibes. What we know is that it is being touted as &nbsp;a game, a movie and something completely new as well. it uses Unreal Engine, 3Lateral and Metahuman technology. Jordan Peele, the director of movies like Nope and Get Out, is collaborating with Kojima Productions so there will be some creepiness and messages within the story. OD will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.</p>
<p>There is no release date yet for OD, but the game is now in full production following the release of Death Stranding 2. OD is an Xbox exclusive.</p>
