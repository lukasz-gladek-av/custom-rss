		<p>After playing John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, I was left doubting my knowledge of the legendary filmmaker’s back catalogue. Was there a zombie-filled Toxic Commando from the mid-80s that he had created? Was this zombie shooter from Saber a licensed reimagining or spiritual sequel? Well, no. While this game is inspired by the tone of some of John Carpenter’s filmography, and a title that’s probably reminding me of Toxic Avenger, this is an original creation. John does love blowing up zombies, though… so it’s a good thing that he’ll get to do just that while playing the game branded with his own name!</p>
<p><iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Gameplay Trailer | Opening Night Live 2025 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvdY54M0x5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been consumed by an outbreak of zombie with glowing eyes, and some chap named Leon is trying to fight back against this. The only problem is he needs some supplies and he can’t get them himself, so why not cook up a way that people on the brink of infection themselves can head out and do this for him? Just slap some glowy blue things on their chest to stall the infection’s progression, and they’ll be good to go!</p>


<p>Of course, we know what a Saber Interactive zombie game entails, and that’s some giant hordes of zombies, but the most tangible difference between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/27/world-war-z-aftermath-review-wwz-ps5-xbox-series-x/">World War Z</a> and Toxic Commando is that you’re presented with more open mission areas, instead of linear levels.</p>
<p>After selecting from a handful of classes and character builds, loadouts and all the usual co-op shooter things, we dropped into an overcast, heavily wooded region to do a bit of Leon’s bidding. The first job was finding and neutralising two hotspots marked on the map, and there’s plenty of options available for you to do so. You can naturally just hoof it on foot, but vehicles are also a great option, whether that’s a basic sedan with half the squad hanging out of its windows blasting away at zombies, or a heavily armoured hummer with a mounted machine gun on top to use.</p>


<p>It feels like a little bit of MudRunner and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">RoadCraft</a> has been fed into the game here, albeit in a light and friendly fashion. The hummer is relatively slow, but weaving through the world’s dangers has a slow and methodical feel to it. You also have a tow cable that can be attached to certain fixed points to pull the car up, or to pull open hidden resource caches.</p>
<p>There’s more than just basic zombies to worry about, though they do pack a decent punch when a few of them manage to close the distance to you. A handful of special infected can make an appearance, including some familiar archetypes, but there’s also these mysterious red tendrils that burrow through the earth, block of some paths as they sprout, and can also shoot at you if given the chance.</p>
<p>Reaching a hot spot means fighting to clear the region and completing a mini objective. This could be filling up a generator with gas to activate some kind of gizmo, or blasting away at weak points on some kind of hard shell, eventually revealing a spiky node that you need to approach and rip apart.</p>

<p>With the nodes broken, our search was narrowed to a church in the region, St Goddard’s, but it’s clearly massively in distress as a huge horde of zombies is coming right down on it. Thankfully a massive energy blast is able to buy its defenders some time, but then you have to place defences, man turrets and tackle a fresh wave of zombies coming from all directions.</p>
<p>This is where the World War Z of it all really comes to the fore. You have just a handful of Spare Parts resource points to put towards defences, though you can find more by exploring the map more fully and finding secret caches. At the same time, there’s resource points dotted around that let you spend this same precious resource to open up some class-specific crates or get you new weapons.</p>

<p>It’s four player co-op, so it absolutely makes sense that there’s four classes, loosely in the vein of a Battlefield. The Medic is pretty self explanatory, while the Operator is great for fixing up things, Strike all about damage dealing, and the Defender is able to put down shields for allies. We didn’t really delve too deeply into these archetypes in the single level we played, but there will be the ability to advance and upgrade each of these, alongside weapons and customisable vehicles, to push down different player builds.</p>
<p>Back to the task at hand and the waves come en masse from three directions, one at a time. Instead of arming electric traps and putting up barriers, I’ve gone further ahead to hop onto a mounted machine gun, splitting my attention between blasting away at the ridge line and checking other flanks for any sneaky surprises that the game might be trying to spring on us – and there were a few! It’s still genuinely impressive to see the vast hordes of zombies just flowing over a cliff, down a hill, pilling up and over a fence and then rushing forward, and it’s obvious why this has become a staple of Saber’s games over the past few years –&nbsp;this and trucks with tow cables!</p>

<p>This game is clearly another love letter to the co-op zombie shooter, taking Saber’s established technologies and wrapping it up in a new setting that’s infused with grungey 80s action movie schlock. You get to blast tons of zombies, though, and that’s probably just what John Carpenter ordered.</p>

			<p>Amongst my many, many silly ideas, becoming a farmer has to rank pretty high amongst them. My long-suffering partner will roll their eyes out of their sockets when I talk about growing crops, herding the sheep in and working outside, not least because I have zero experience in this field. But not anymore! If Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is anything to go by, I’ll be very good at being a farmer, not least because I’m willing to push myself to the point of exhaustion, I’ll work in torrential rain, and because a lot of your time seems to be spent chatting.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Cozy Living Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEr-kUsGhiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is both thoroughly new, and thoroughly old, standing as a remake of Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar, a Nintendo DS entry in the series from a time before you could pluck controllers off the side of your console. As all Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon games go, you’ve been given a farm, but it’s mostly full of weeds and rocks, rather than anything you would want to eat. It’s then up to you to tidy the place up, fill it with crops, nurture some of the cutest cows and chickens in gaming and, if you’re lucky, find a husband or wife to spend your farming days with.</p>


<p>In and of itself, that’s plenty of fun for the cosy gamer, but there’s still the Grand Bazaar part of the title to deal with. Your farm is part of a small town that’s a little down on its luck, with the blame firmly laid at the entrance of its failing weekly market. Alongside all the work you have to do for your farm and for your prospective love life, you’re also tasked with revitalising the Bazaar, running your own market stall each week, as well as trying to attract new merchants and entrepreneurs to fill out its empty plots.</p>


<p>If that all sounds like a lot, it is. Time runs especially fast in Grand Bazaar, with each day lasting around ten minutes. In that space of time you will find yourself running around town like a sickle-wielding maniac, desperately trying to talk to or greet every potential love interest, nurture your crops, cuddle your pets, milk the cows, groom the alpacas, shear the sheep, go mining, trim the weeds, collect some flowers, hand out gifts, craft items, go fishing, visit the shops, complete some side quests, and a bunch of other things, all while planning out what you have to do in the next day, or week, ready for the impending punctuation point of the weekly market. If you’re like me, that’s a heady and utterly engrossing mix of busy work, but there’s some clear repetition to those tasks that might not fit with other people.</p>
<p>The growth of your town eases some of that repetition, alongside the occasionally enlightening and often pointed conversations with the townsfolk, through to the semi-regular events that crop up, ranging from pet and crop shows to competitive showjumping events. Besides that, the focus of upgrading your tools, or setting yourself to a particular villager request, means that there are times where you have to step away from your usual routine, and these bring enough change to the formula to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>Your level of activity is limited by your stamina bar. Every major action, like tilling the fields, harvesting crops or mining, takes its toll on your body, and like a regular human being you’ll soon become tired. You can alleviate this by eating a meal, or taking a refreshing shower, but you always need to be aware of pushing yourself too far. Story of Seasons is relatively realistic in that sense, with overwork eventually causing you to collapse, or a late night then causing you to oversleep the next day. Broadly, there’s a lot to juggle each day, and the tight time and stamina constraints mean you can’t ever rest too easily.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is horribly addictive, once it’s sunk its crop-clearing sickle into you. I was supposed to play other games this last week, and instead I played Story of Seasons. I was supposed to go out, but instead I played Story of Seasons. Any number of things, including eating, were postponed because I was playing Story of Seasons. I’m not entirely sure it is actually a cosy game, given how far it sinks itself into your psyche and how much of it becomes about doing a job. I think it’s probably more of a farming sim than this year’s Farming Simulator, just with cute graphics, and I have been entirely won over by it.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s not pushing the Switch 2 all that far, but the bright, vibrant art design shines through, and the characters all look and feel like distinct people, aided by the additional artwork that can accompany each conversation. Oddly, you can make the frame rate stutter a tiny bit here and there, generally when you’re using your handy glider to get around, but it doesn’t affect gameplay at all, and one of the joys of the game becomes using the little cut-throughs or jumping across the roofs of houses on your way across town.</p>

<p>The only complaint with Grand Bazaar remains from the original version of the game, which is the annoyances of having three different windmills to craft items in, and having to run between the three of them as you attempt to craft the most lucrative items. Some of that has been lightened by the sprite boxes which let you transport yourself and items around the town, but it does feel like there might still be a better way to ease some of that busy work.</p>
