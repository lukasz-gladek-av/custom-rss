		<p>Activision and Xbox have confirmed the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, the direct sequel to last year’s Black Ops 6, and Activision’s contender in this year’s FPS battle with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Black Ops 7 is coming out on 14th November.</p>

<p>With its reveal back at Summer Game Fest, one of the surprises from Black Ops 7 was that it will star Milo Ventimiglia, who’s still best known as Peter Petrelli from Heroes. Of course he doesn’t have super powers, he’s playing David Mason, the closest thing that this Black Ops team has to a nepo baby, and he’s leading the Black Ops team against a manipulative enemy, the returning Raul Menendez, who’s weaponising fear above all else in the year 2035. The story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6, and looks like it could be bridging the divide to some of the ultra-futuristic themes of Black Ops 3 as well.&nbsp;There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon.</p>
<p>There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>

<p>Multiplayer and Zombies will not be revealed until Call of Duty Next on 30th September.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s been just a year since the last game in the Black Ops sub-series, a tactic that didn’t work out so well for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a>. We had an absolutely fantastic time with Black Ops 6 last year, and hopefully this game keeps that momentum going. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">our review we said</a>, “Modern Warfare had a great run, but Black Ops is now back on top in their ongoing sibling rivalry. Fluid character movement, high-tempo multiplayer, evolved Zombies co-op, and an incredible campaign come together in 2024’s most irresistible first person shooter.”</p>

		<p>During the gamescom Opening Night Live pre-show, One More Level and Lyrical Games announced Valor Mortis, a new first person Soulslike set during the Napoleonic Wars. In Valor Mortis you play as William, a soldier in Napoleon’s army who dies and is resurrected to continue to fight. However, the world has changed and a plague has consumed Europe, whose power is something you control.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis - Reveal Trailer | First-Person Soulslike" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis will see you die over and over, but each time you do you can grow more powerful by learning new skills and attacks for your weapons to deal with the corrupted forces that are now your enemies. Valor Mortis will take historical figures from Napoleon’s time and see them twisted into horrors within this macabre new world. A release date for Valor Mortis is yet to be confirmed, but the game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. If you are interested in experiencing Valor Mortis, you can sign up for playtests on the official <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/">Valor Mortis</a> website.</p>
