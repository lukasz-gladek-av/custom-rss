		<p>Nintendo has announced an overhaul for how digital game licenses are handled on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with the new Virtual Game Card.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The change will make digital game use much more like how you use and share physical game cartridges. When purchasing a digital game, it will be loaded as a Virtual Game Cartridge, giving you access to that game on that particular system.</p>
<p>Using a new dedicated management screen, you can manage those games to load and eject them individually. Ejecting from one Switch system will then let you load it onto a second Switch system – your account is seemingly limited to using this feature through two systems only, and will require local communication in order to bind them together.</p>
<p>That’s a bit of an upheaval when compared to playing your games on any Switch console simply by having an online connection to authenticate your login.</p>

<p>However, this does present new opportunities for families and friends. You will now be able to lend to members within your NIntendo Switch Online family group. This again requires a local wireless connection in order to do so, and you can only lend one game at a time to each person. Additionally, they will only be available for up to 2 weeks before they are automatically returned to you.</p>
<p>This seems like a better system for families to share one copy of a big single player game, perhaps, and certainly when compared to the tricky primary account for game sharing that has been a staple of console gaming since the late aughts. It’s not clear yet if this effectively grants that game license to the whole console (if a primary console for another person’s account), or if it’s user specific.</p>
<p>This system will be implemented in a system update for Nintendo Switch in late April, and will apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>
<p>We’ll hopefully have more details soon with a full FAQ to detail the changes, but there’s seemingly both upsides and downsides to this new system for individual and family uses. However, it does seem appropriate to address this, given the likelihood of a lot of people having two generations of console in the relatively near future…</p>
