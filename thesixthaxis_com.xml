<p>When the PIONER open beta ended, GFAGames did state that there would be a further stress test to address the issues and bugs that players experienced. In a statement at the time, the team said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort.&nbsp;<wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release.&nbsp;<wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand.</p>

		<p>StarRupture will be having a co-op playtest running from December 3rd to December 8th, Creepy Jar has announced. The co-op playtest will run continuously through these dates so players can try out what is on offer as much as they want. There is also no NDA so everything can be shared, and joining the StarRupture playtest is as simple as heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture Steam page</a> and clicking the request access button.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture Co-op Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDfmyjbHKWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Creepy Jar has stated that the those who choose to play the StarRupture playtest will give acces to an early part of the game, the single player tutorial, and a free play option which will give limited access to StarRupture’s map. Bugs have been addressed since the July single player playtest, and performance has also been improved. Creepy Jar also wants players to not worry about spoilers as plenty of content is being held back for its Early Access release.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

<p>StarRupture will launch on January 6th, 2026 into Steam Early Access.</p>
