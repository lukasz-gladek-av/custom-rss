		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> sequel is in the works, developer Shift Up has confirmed in an investor relations presentation, and it could be coming pretty soon.</p>
<p>One slide in particular outlines a timetable that extends from 2024 through to 2027, showing two entries for Stellar Blade with “Platform Expansion” related to an impending PC port of Stellar Blade, and then a larger block labelled “Sequel”.</p>



<p>In other words, a sequel is well on its way and should be released by 2027.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade obviously makes a lot of sense, when you consider the positive critical reviews and healthy sales that it had. The game currently sits at 81 on Metacritic and was able to quickly sell 1 million units within its first two months on sale for PS5, and the IR presentation states that it has made 68.1bn KRW (that’s ~ £365 million). A PC version is set to be released shortly on 11th June, which is only going to bolster those figures.</p>

<p>The original game took around five years to be released from its first teaser as Project Eve in 2019, through to the game’s launch in 2024 (though it was originally intended for 2023). Game sequels can often be quicker to develop, as the initial burden of conceptualising gameplay, building up a technical foundation, and staffing a full team has already been done. Importantly, a 2026 or 2027 target would put Stellar Blade within the PS5 generation still, meaning that Shift Up wouldn’t have to consider going through all the pain of gearing up for a new game engine and new console generation.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is a good, solid action game from Shift Up, blending together high action a la Bayonetta and Nier Automata, and some great PS5 visuals. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/stellar-blade-review/">Stellar Blade review</a>, “Stellar Blade is a pretty enjoyable game to swing your hairband sword at, so long as you don’t mind the obvious sexualisation. There’s a few rough areas, but nothing to spoil things overall and there’s plenty of interesting story to uncover as you fight your way through giant monsters with circular saws for heads and weird tentacles for legs.”</p>
