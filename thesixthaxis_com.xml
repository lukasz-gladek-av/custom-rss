		<p>There are few franchises as iconic, memorable, and far-reaching as Resident Evil. A horror staple since the days of the original PlayStation, it’s become an instantly recognisable brand, its zombie action extending through multiple genres and platforms into cinema, TV and beyond. Alongside being an excellent new entry in the series – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-review/">see our review here</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> continues the series foray into new territory, arriving day and date on the Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, alongside a Resident Evil cavalcade that includes the two most recent mainline entries – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil Village</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve all been wondering how Capcom would manage in bringing their latest premier game to the distinctly less-powerful Switch 2, but, once again, this is a showcase for the adaptability of the in-house RE Engine, and for the development team’s smart choices when approaching Nintendo’s hybrid console.</p>



<p>You start out as Grace. An FBI analyst, she’s tasked with investigating the latest in a series of strange deaths. These bodies have been found looking decidedly unhealthy, covered in dark bruising, and are all tied together as previous survivors of the Raccoon City ‘incident’. You know the one. What’s perhaps a little hard to swallow is that the latest of these deaths has been found at the Wrenwood Hotel, the place where her own mother was murdered. I’m no expert in HR, but I feel like Grace could put in a grievance for being sent back there. On her own. With only a flashlight and a gun for company. Requiem would have been a much shorter game, and involved more HR meetings, though, so we’ll look past it.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem gives you a batch of options for how to view and play both Grace and Leon’s sections. The recommended setup has you playing Grace’s more investigative, atmospheric and horror-filled levels in first person, before switching to a third-person over-the-shoulder viewpoint for Leon’s bombastic action sections. You can choose to completely ignore Capcom’s recommendation, but it feels very natural to shift between the two, especially when Grace’s storyline is so much more personal and immediate – it really benefits from the first-person viewpoint.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is some visual trickery and upscaling in effect from the moment you start Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2. All of the cutscenes are in-engine, so you’ll immediately see the telltale shimmer of anti-aliasing around Grace’s hair, and curved surfaces. Character models are less detailed than what you’ll see on other platforms, reflections are screen-space instead of ray-traced, and some building and area textures appear to have been dialled back too. For all of that, Requiem is still a great-looking game on Switch 2, and, most importantly, I found myself thoroughly immersed in the story and its action. While I was meant to be looking for visual quirks and downgrades, I soon stopped. What Capcom have produced here is remarkable.</p>
<p>The goal here is 60fps, and Grace’s sections do a good job of generally hitting that target. They clearly benefit from being in more confined areas, and Grace’s slower pace, but they’re also very lighting-intensive, with flashlights, broken lights and naked flames playing out believably, ramping up the sense of danger and the cloying atmosphere perfectly. It all feels very impressive, and only heightens the immersion. As with elsewhere, there are compromises if you look for them, so sometimes you’ll see jagged, pixellated edges to the flashlight beams during cutscenes, but in action, it’s either less noticeable or it’s not there at all.</p>

<p>Leon’s missions don’t stick the 60fps landing, and in our rough estimation, it can come closer to 40fps. A lot of that comes down to the larger areas, the number of enemies or bystanders on screen, and Leon performing the seasoned, action hero role in comparison to Grace’s inexperienced, investigative tech analyst. It’s something of a shame that there are no overarching graphical options or the ability to opt for the consistency of a locked 30fps, but ideologically, it seems that the Resident Evil team have always preferred an unlocked frame rate in previous titles on previous generations – it can be a touch more responsive, but you can end up with a juddery feeling. Even so, Leon’s sections still play very well don’t drop below 30fps from what we’ve seen and tested.</p>
<p>The real saving grace (pun intended) for the Switch 2’s cross-platform ports is the availability of DLSS, and while it’s being pushed pretty hard to upscale for a 4K output, it’s impressively accomplished with an acceptable level of softness to the display. If anything, it works with Requiem’s art direction to a surprising degree, and there’s still a clear cinematic quality to how everything looks. Undocked, there’s the added bonus of built-in VRR to smooth performance out further. Handheld feels just as steady as docked play, and there are points where you’ll wonder what kind of ritual sacrifices Capcom had to make to get there.</p>

<p>It’s a shame that there are no mouse controls in the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem, as I think it would work really well across both Grace and Leon’s sections. At least we live in a time where it might be added further down the line. Capcom still make use of a couple of the Switch 2’s tricks, and HD Rumble 2 makes a startling difference to the way that scenes and sections feel. Through the opening areas, you can feel the rumble of a passing subway train, initially strong and obvious and then diminishing as it heads off, while the steady pitter-patter of the rain, or the accompanying blast of lightning, adds a layer of immersion well beyond the visuals. It’s definitely another selling point.</p>
<p>While there aren’t currently mouse controls, there are gyro motion controls, and if you’re looking for a bit more precision when aiming, it’s a handy inclusion. There are further aim assist settings too, if you’re not that great at hitting zombies in the head, with these turned on automatically for the Casual difficulty, or being a toggle in the Modern and Classic options.</p>
<p>Resident Evil: Requiem on Switch 2 is a stunning port that once again showcases what Nintendo’s handheld hardware is capable of.</p>

			<p>After a series of fantastic remakes and two games focusing on the misadventures of Ethan Winters, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> finally returns to continue Leon Kennedy’s attempts to take down the Umbrella Corporation and end its legacy. Once again, he is not alone in his task, although rather than a series staple we now have a new character in the form of Grace Ashcroft, an FBI agent who is also the daughter of a character from the PS2 Outbreak spin-offs. This connection between different strands of Resident Evil is emblematic of the game as a whole; a game which at times feels like a compilation of highlights from the series in terms of references and set pieces. This isn’t a criticism, though, as the pacing is so well judged here that any long-time fan will be grinning for the duration.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 4th Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXVy4mALHLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The dual protagonists – and more interestingly, dual perspectives – in the game have drawn a lot of attention. In practice, this feels like another way in which Requiem is paying homage to the whole series that precedes it, with Grace’s first-person parts having the overwhelming tension and fragility of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7</a> while Leon’s more gung-ho third person action is straight out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/17/resident-evil-4-remake-review/">Resident Evil 4</a> playbook. You can override the camera view, but this isn’t just a gimmick and the dynamics in gameplay and atmosphere make every part of the game feel like a high point. Revisiting areas that you anxiously snuck around as Grace when fully armed as Leon has the same freeing effect as a New Game Plus often does.</p>


<p>The story here is pure Resident Evil, and as such is wonderfully daft. Following the plot closely requires more than a passing knowledge of the series as a whole, but there is plenty of internal narrative to keep it interesting for a newcomer too. Grace begins the game as a FBI investigator sent to check out the mysterious deaths of individuals who survived the initial outbreak in Raccoon City, before being caught up in a conspiracy that takes you to the very heart of Umbrella’s nefarious schemes. While chasing up leads for this conspiracy, Leon discovers Grace’s involvement and sets out to rescue her. From this point on, the game takes you on a tour of both new and familiar locations, culminating in an endgame face-off that has fascinating ramifications for the series going forward.</p>


<p>Grace’s sections are characterised by stealth, but she isn’t totally helpless. The titular Requiem handgun – a ridiculously overpowered handcannon – is given to her by Leon early on but ammo for this is incredibly scarce so it remains a last resort throughout. She does have a more basic pistol and knives for protection but it can often be a better choice to avoid conflict. That being said, on the standard difficulty I did find Grace’s sections to include enough ammo to take out most of the zombies, an approach which took away from the survival horror a little. Then again, I tend to prefer the action-orientated approach over the creeping in shadows, so this suited me.</p>
<p>Grace’s sections also contain the more defined puzzles, with Leon’s mostly involving finding key items. With Grace, you’ll need to carefully scan photos and documents to find the solution to environmental puzzles, but there is nothing here to act as a real roadblock as is often the case in Silent Hill games. Grace’s unique mechanic is a blood collector that enables her to use the infected blood of enemies to craft items, ranging from ammunition to health upgrades. This is a novel take on the usual upgrade aspect of modern RE games, and is echoed by Leon’s more traditional credits obtained from defeating enemies in combat.</p>

<p>As Leon makes his way through the game he has access to the full range of weaponry you’d expect, from various pistols with different strengths to high powered rifles and machine guns. I found all the weapons to be useful in the various combat encounters that litter his sections, with switching between them often being more efficient than reloading in the middle of a fight. I can certainly see huge potential in speed-running the game through expert use of each weapon to navigate fights in the most time effective way. Weapons can be upgraded as you progress but there isn’t a standard New Game Plus mode in which you retain all of these upgrades. You can use credits from defeated foes to buy the weapons earlier in subsequent playthroughs however, so this feels like a suitable substitution.</p>
<p>The in-game achievements and related challenge points are once again used to purchase special items, upgrades, costumes, concept art etc. Many of these challenges are familiar from the recent remakes and provide a great amount of replayability and extra ways to enjoy the central game. This is particularly important as there may well be some negative responses to Requiem’s ten hour duration, somewhat shorter than the most recent Resident Evil 4 Remake. The game’s length is far more in keeping with the rest of the series, though, and is well judged to be all killer and no filler.</p>

<p>The RE Engine continues to be one of the most impressively optimised gaming experiences, reviewing on PC. I played through the game on desktop with an RTX4060 ti and Ryzen 3600 (still going strong) with a stable 75fps on high settings aside from one mid-game boss fight which tanked the frame rate for a few seconds. Requiem even performed at a playable level on Steam Deck straight out of the box, and we’ve been able to check out the game on Nintendo Switch 2, with Capcom making all the right compromises to get a good feeling experience, albeit with a more variable frame rate – see our Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 impressions here. On PC, I stuck to mouse and keyboard due to the first person parts but found that third person view controlled excellently this way as well.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Resident Evil Requiem is a superb entry in the series and feels like a ‘best of’ at times with the persistent Easter eggs, references, and gameplay callbacks to the full range of earlier games. There is a vast amount of wider lore for fans of that part of Capcom’s legendary titles, but even newcomers will be caught up in the narrative and balls to the wall gameplay. RE Requiem is up there with the very best of the series.	</p></div>
