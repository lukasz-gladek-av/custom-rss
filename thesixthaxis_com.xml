		<p>TerraTech Legion rolls into the enemy-infested wastelands, guns blazing, electricity arcing and explosives… exploding all around. A fresh take on the bullet heaven style, it’s inherently addictive and satisfying to put together successful runs filled with screen-clearing chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="TerraTech Legion | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnooYvvu-vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s still a good way to go, from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729960/TerraTech_Legion_Demo/">what’s shown in the demo</a> through to a fully fleshed-out release, but the core experience is already solid and shows plenty of potential.</p>


<p>Any time there’s a new genre and game style emerging, there’s bound to be imitators and clones. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivor">Vampire Survivor</a> remains a sensation to this day, constantly updated and with mini expansions, but as it leans into its retro style and amusing jank, there’s so much scope and potential for other developers and gaming universes to riff off its ideas and feel different.</p>
<p>For TerraTech Legion, that’s in driving a vehicle from a top-down view, with all the tricks that this lends in manoeuvring around enemies and obstacles. With turning circles accelerating and potentially quite cumbersome and lumbering handling for a beefy vehicle, you need to pilot in a more considered way.</p>


<p>And then there’s the vehicle construction element, which is adapted from TerraTech proper. You start with a pre-formed vehicle, with dozens of attachment points on the top, sides and rear to bolt weapons and augmentations onto, but after even just a few of these are awarded, you might start to feel constrained, needing to bolt extra surfaces or extension arms onto your vehicle to gain more space. It’s a fun and easy to grasp vehicle builder, items snapping into place to those mounting points.</p>
<p>But how do you get those new upgrades? As is typical for this genre, you need to collect gems that are dropped by fallen enemies, filling up a bar that then heralds an upgrade crate to give you a choice of three new weapons. You can also pick up augment crates dropped by enemies that are then opened as you reach this level up stage. This is also the point at which you get to add things to your vehicle, and you’re given freedom to tear everything back down and reconfigure it to match a new or evolving plan for your build. Need more space for guns? Perhaps sticking augment modules underneath extra blocks will give you more topside space?</p>

<p>There’s a few different ways that you can play, a handful of different damage types with multiple different weapons that let you combine them with buffs and upgrades, or you can lean in on kinetic damage and crash through hordes with hefty boosts. It took one run for me to really figure out my successful strategy, bolting a whole battery of miniguns and railguns pointing to the side, backed up by some more general weapons covering the other sides. The key thinking to this was that it would allow me to effectively strafe around the main hordes of enemies and bosses, while forward or rear-facing weapons forced me hand to less-desirable driving style, and omni-directional weapons have less oomph.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, this was exceptionally satisfying, with the railguns giving a bit of range before the miniguns could open up as enemies get within range, just spewing out bullets in an angry hum of metal. With a bunch of ballistic damage boosters attached, I could make short work of pretty much everything, barring the bosses.</p>

<p>The demo level has two bosses on show, which throw a little bit of bullet hell back your way. A large, bulbous mid-boss appears partway through and repeatedly lifts off and lands before sending out waves of energy projectiles that you need to dodge –&nbsp;which is no mean feat when also dealing with a large sweep of regular enemies! –&nbsp;while the level ending boss summoned glowing orange orbs for enemies to spawn from, as well as sending out laser beams to cordon you in for a short time. They’re decent bosses, though it’s often a bit tricky to figure out in the latter boss has its beams at ground level when it’s moving around. I definitely want to see more variety in the full game, and more challenging attack patterns.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a demo, so there’s plenty that’s missing and promised for the full release of TerraTech Legion. More starter vehicles, more biomes, more enemies and bosses, and an emerging metagame that taps into all the resources you can collect while playing. I’d also like to see more emphasis put on specialising down different weapon types and damage synergies, where it currently feels like I can be a bit too general with my choices. This is a solid starting point, though, a vehicle core which Payload Studios can bolt more ideas onto, and I’m keen to see more.</p>

		<p>Ace Combat is 30 years old having released in 1995, and Bandai Namco is marking the 30th anniversary with a couple of things. The publisher has released a commemorative video that celebrates the franchise, announced an orchestra concert, a controller and even teased a brand new game in the series though no concrete details have been revealed. There is a message from Kazutoki Kono, the brand director for Ace Combat, where the game is teased. You can read his statement after the video.</p>
<p><iframe title="エースコンバットシリーズ30周年 記念ムービー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmXUy2MCUA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Since the release of the first title in 1995, thanks to your unwavering support, the ACE COMBAT series has reached a remarkable milestone—its 30th anniversary in 2025. First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all our fans and everyone involved who has supported the series throughout the years. Thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart. This moment is our chance to return thirty years’ worth of appreciation to you.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe that sustaining a legacy over three decades means far more than simply the passage of time. I’ve always shared this message with everyone involved in the series: “To deliver emotionally resonant, high-quality experiences that exceed expectations, to spark excitement for what comes next—and then to meet that anticipation with even greater ambition. By continuing this cycle, we build a bond of trust with our players, and that bond is the truest expression of our gratitude.”</em></p>
<p><em>Over the past thirty years, times have changed. Values have shifted, technologies have evolved. Our company and our team have continually transformed to navigate these tides. In a word, we’ve embraced change. There were times we may not have fully met your expectations. But I also believe there were moments when we exceeded them—when we soared higher than anyone imagined.</em></p>

<p><em>Namco’s founder, Masaya Nakamura, once said, “Only those who can adapt to change will survive.”</em><br>
<em>I joined Namco in 1994. Back then, I understood those words intellectually—but not yet from experience. Now, I truly do. After three incredible decades of adapting to change, we’ve built an enduring bond of trust with all of you. That connection is the very force that has sustained the ACE COMBAT series and propelled it into the future. I can now feel this truth in every fiber of my being. And I’m proud—proud that our ongoing commitment to delivering value and earning your trust has led us to this 30th anniversary. And now, we’re ready. Everything is in place. It’s time to take flight once again—toward even greater heights.”</em></p>
<p>Bandai Namco has partnered with <a href="https://www.type2.co.jp/products/ac/">Type 2 to release an Ace Combat Pro gaming controller</a>, primarily made for PC but it is also compatible with the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.&nbsp; The controller has Hall effect analog sticks to avoid drift issues. There are also four buttons on the back that can be assigned with customised inputs too.</p>

<p>The 30th anniversary poster for Ace Combat also teases the new entry to series with a conspicuous gap that can be see on the bottom right where there is space for a badge.</p>

<p>If you want to attend the 30th anniversary concert you will have to make your way to Saitama Kaikan in Saitama, Japan. It will be taking place on January 31st, 2026. This will not just be a concert to play some of the iconic tracks from the Ace Combat series, as the development team will be in attendance for a Q&amp;A session.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edward-kenway%E2%80%99s-voice-actor-hints-at-a-black-flag-remake.1231383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Matt Ryan, the voice actor for Edward Kenway in Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, was recently filmed while signing merch at a convention. While he is busy signing his name, he looks up at the camera and asks, “Have you beat the game?” to which the person behind the camera replies, “I have, a while ago.”</p>
<p>“You may have to beat again,” says Matt, and then looks up with a very cheeky grin on his face.</p>


<p>Ubisoft confirmed remakes of Assassin’s Creed games were being considered but so far none have arrived. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is widely regarded as one of the best Assassin’s Creed games and rumours of a remake have been floating around in the ether for a good few years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1st</a> recently reported that the remake would be running on the Anvil engine and “will feature new systems, with combat and ecosystems around wildlife specifically mentioned.” It has been suggested the remake would be out sometime this year, possibly in time for the big Christmas market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-hinted/">Insider Gaming</a> spotted that artists at Pure Arts, a company that makes statues based on video game characters, seemed to announce the game before anyone else. “Assassin’s Creed fans out there, you should be aware that there is something going on with Edward [Keyway]”, said one host who was then interrupted by the other host who seems to panic and says“Wait has that been announced?”</p>

<p>“I think so, I’m pretty sure I saw rumours about it. No, I definitely saw at article about it”, he continued, “So there’s going to be something going on with Edward, and our PVC 1/8th scale statue will reflect that accordingly”.</p>
<p>We gave the original release<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/10/30/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review/"> 9/10 back in 2013</a></p>
<p>“Black Flag is more than just a return to form for Assassin’s Creed, it is an overall improvement and probably the best game in the series yet,” said Gareth. “It has taken the gameplay of the previous games, refined it, and combined it with a huge open world that is packed with enough content to literally last for days. If you have ever wanted a proper pirate game, this is as good as it gets.”</p>
