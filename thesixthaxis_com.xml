		<p>Well…. it’s been quite the tumultuous week in the real world, but gaming has provided a pleasant escape.

		<p>There is going to be a Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta, with SNK confirming that it will take place in February. The exact dates and timing of the open beta have been set for between February 20th 12 AM PST to February 24, 2025 11:59 PM PST, with those taking part able to choose from eight characters and two control schemes. The beta will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjjlpCoBOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SNK has not announced which characters will be making the cut for the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta yet, with those details to be confirmed at a yet unknown later date. The playable modes in the beta will be an offline tutorial mode, and three online modes; Ranked Match, Room Match, Casual Match. The two control schemes have for the game have previously been confirmed as Arcade Style and Smart Style. Arcade Style is a classic multi button input scheme to pull off combos and special moves, while Smart Style uses directional inputs and single button presses to perform special moves. The beta will also give players a proper first impression of the new REV system, which combines a system of REV Arts, REV Accel, and REV Blows to fill a REV meter that will then unleash powerful offensive moves.</p>
<p>The Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves beta will not require a &nbsp;PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass Core/Ultimate subscription, so anyone with an internet connection can experience it. SNK has stated that any save date from this open beta will not be transferrable to the retail release on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves either. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves confirmed release date is set for April 24th, 2025. It will get a physical release on PS5 and PS4, with a digital release on all confirmed platforms too. The first season pass will include five additional characters, including Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li.</p>
