		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for September 2025 and it would be fair to say they are underwhelming.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus September 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 2nd September :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>Psychonauts 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>So who had to Google “Viewfinder PS5”, because I did. This is the first time the game has been written about on TSA, even though it was released in July 2023 on PS5 and PC, PS4 the following December, then on Xbox Series X|S this month, and Switch later this year. So what is the game about?</p>

<p><em>“Use an instant camera to challenge perception, redefine reality and reshape the world. View the world through a new lens in this charming and unique first-person puzzle adventure. Reshape a wealth of stunning environments through your instant camera’s viewfinder in order to solve a variety of mind-bending puzzles. Bring photos, paintings, sketches and postcards to life as you reshape reality and slowly uncover the surprising mysteries that lie behind this colourful world.”</em></p>

<p>Next up is Stardew Valley which originally launched in 2016 on PC and came to PS4 eight years ago. I seem to remember the PS Vita version was on PS Plus at some point. Does anyone really need to be told what Stardew Valley is about? You do, at the back? Really? Have you been living under a rock for the last ten years?</p>
<p><em>“You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!”</em></p>

<p>And finally we have the excellent Psychonauts 2 which was released on Xbox back in 2021 with the PS4 version arriving in 2023. Rather than explain what the game is about, why not watch our handy video review! Spoiler: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">It’s great we gave it 9/10</a></p>
