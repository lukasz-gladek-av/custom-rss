		<p>Two Point Studios has announced that the next DLC for Two Point Museum will give players a new wildlife wing with Zooseum. Zooseum is less about putting animals on as exhibits but more on rescuing them, raising them, healing their issues, and working to rewild them. Much like what many modern zoos do. That also makes one wonder if this is a possible glimpse of a future Two Point Zoo game.</p>

<p>Aside from the short teaser trailer, there has been no further details about Two Point Museum’s Zooseum. Content and a release date will be announced later on, though a specific timeframe has not been given. Two Point Museum is launching on Nintendo Switch 2 tomorrow, and handily we have a review of it.</p>

<p>In our review, Stefan said, <em>“Two Point Museum on Switch 2 is a fairly straightforward port to Nintendo’s latest console. The minor glitches and crashes should be ironed out quickly, but it’s clear that the game simulation does hit the limits of the Switch 2’s CPU and larger museums do drop the frame rate. Still, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable and endlessly quirky management sim that’s an easy recommendation for fans of the genre and this series in particular. If you can’t accept a few compromises, the other platforms are ready and waiting.”</em></p>
