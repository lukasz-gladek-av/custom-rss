		<p>Toem 2 was teased during the Wholesome Snack stream, revealing that a sequel to the black and white game of photography is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOEM 2 Teaser Trailer | Wholesome Snack 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze4DSeIhYAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s just a little bit of blurb about the game from developer Something We Made:</p>
<p>Step back into the shoes of a curious photographer and set off on a brand new adventure all about uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world’s little wonders in TOEM 2, the sequel to the acclaimed TOEM.</p>
<p>Yup, it’s a straight up sequel and looks to be following very much in the photographs of footprints of the original. You’ll play as a keen shutterbug who’s keen to explore the world around them through the lens of their camera, as you explore there’s plenty of people to help out with your photography skills, earning stamps needed to get the next free bus trip to another place.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, is in black and white, which gives the game its distinctive look.</p>
<p>For our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/toem-review-a-delightful-photo-adventure/">the original Toem</a>, Nic said, “Toem might be short, but with the number of challenges, and you can finish it an afternoon if you’re looking for something fun and relaxing to throw yourself at, or dip in and out to complete every little side mission. With the winter evenings drawing in, Toem is the kind of game I can see myself coming back to with a hot chocolate and a blanket, as I settle in to bring a little joy to the denizens of the world of Toem.”</p>
