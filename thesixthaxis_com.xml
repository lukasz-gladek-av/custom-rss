		<p>The Empire is under threat from within, and only the Order of Foresight has a chance to save it. The latest game from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/28/olija-review/">Olija</a> developer Skeleton Crew, Forestrike is a martial arts brawler where you can see the future… kind of. Coming to Switch and PC later this year, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325930/Forestrike_Demo/">a demo is now available on Steam</a> to try and we’ve been hands on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Leaf School Combat Overview | Play the First Demo on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQvhBv8kTlc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You see, the power of Foresight is bestowed upon a select few, including our apprentice protagonist, Yu. When faced with a clutch of bad dudes that need defeating, Yu can only take a couple hits, but can enter into Foresight and unpick the chain of events that’s going to occur and how to turn it around in his favour. It’s a bit like he’s borrowed Doctor Strange’s time stone to have a peep at all the possibilities.</p>


<p>Foresight is basically a trial run, a practice arena where you can figure out the attacks coming your way and how to use your limited dodge, pickups and standard light and heavy attacks to defeat them. You’ll see what enemies emerge to surround you, and then learn to pick them apart one-by-one until you stand victorious.</p>


<p>If an enemy comes charging at Yu, he can engage a dodge mode that will pass that charing enemy straight through you and see them barrel into someone stood on the other side, dealing damage to both. Similarly, an enemy that is able to dodge can be tricked into using that either by a bullrushing enemy you’ve evaded or by triggering them with an attack for your own, opening themselves up for attack immediately after.</p>
<p>It’s essentially an action puzzle game where you need to try and figure out a path through and then execute your plan. Get it wrong and you’ll lose health pips or even die, sending you right back to the start of the game’s roguelite form.</p>
<p>The demo does a good job of slowly introducing you to these concepts before letting you go on a run and see the roguelite structure. Working your way from the countryside, through the mountains, the city and into the inner court of the Emperor, you’ll have a choice of levels to take on, many of which come with rewards and fresh abilities.</p>

<p>For example, one could make your light attacks spin enemies around, potentially disorient them to then turn and attack their allies. Or you could gain health from instances of friendly fire amongst them, or cancel out and steal their weapons. Levels that reward you with a new abilities present you with three to choose from, but others can also upgrade abilities – that turn-about ability can then stun enemies, if upgraded. There’s also a shop to spend coins – if not using those to open up a further path.</p>
<p>It comes to a head when facing a boss. Larger health bars, quickly recharging dodge abilities, and some audacious attacks – Master Ogai in the demo can tumble into one of his allies and just fling them at you – makes them a real task to figure out, come up with a plan and then pull it off. It’s not something that I managed in my exploratory run, despite well over a dozen efforts in Foresight.</p>

<p>The demo has one of Yu’s potential mentors, the old Master Talgun who pops up in your Foresight like a Jedi ghost and gives a little guidance. He rejects violence typically, but even he pushes for an attack-first principle in certain situations. He’s just one of a handful of masters that you’ll be able to choose from at the start of a run, each of which has a different school of combat, which you can master and ultimately combine.</p>
<p>For now, the demo provides a tasty morsel of the action that Forestrike will offer when it launches later this year. Unpicking the combat puzzles is sure to prove delectable to a particular cachet of players, ramping up to those ‘real’ battles where you have only one shot to pull off what you’ve been practicing, and leading to some gloriously slick combat sequences that would fit right into a martial arts movie.</p>

			<p>I love a good action game. Heck, I love a lot of middling action games so long as they’ve got one or two really cool things about them. The First Berserker: Khazan is definitely not a middling action game though, and has a lot of style along with a lot of substance that makes it a blast to play from start to finish, along with a gorgeous art style and some very edgy but entertaining writing.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Demo Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aU6bt8ArKY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Khazan describes itself as a “hardcore action RPG,” which is a fun way to say that while it definitely evokes the Soulslike subgenre, it’s not quite a Soulslike. I actually really like that it’s not gunning to be a Soulslike, because while the weighty combat and the checkpoint system definitely mean a lot of players will be reminded of ye olde Dark Souls, it’s got a lot more in common with action games in general. It feels a bit more like a slower-paced Nioh, and that’s wonderful.</p>


<p>The main distinction here, for me at least, is that it’s just a little bit more easygoing in terms of difficulty, but also that there’s a lot more loot. Outside of the three main weapon categories, which are dual blades, big old sword, and spear, you’ve then got loads of armour sets to muck around with that have unique stats and properties, as well as set bonuses. It means there are a lot of ways to upgrade Khazan as he marches down the path of revenge and anime.</p>


<p>There are a load of little touches that allow the game to be a little more chilled too. While it’s always challenging, there’s little touches like gaining experience just from hitting bosses, skills unlocking as you play instead of at set points, and also an easy difficulty if you just want to smash things up. It all adds up to make a game that’s not holding your hand, but also isn’t actively trying to shoot you in the foot.</p>
<p>Wrapped around the gameplay is an art style that I absolutely adore. A lot of games go for an anime look using cel shading, but there’s plenty examples where that doesn’t work out. The style of The First Berserker: Khazan, both visually and in terms of the setting and story, means it all feels a lot more cohesive. This is an over-the-top story of revenge and battling through the underworld, and the visuals that render the regions you visit and the beasts and enemies you battle just help sell the whole thing.</p>

<p>The story kicks off in a fun way too – well, not “fun”, but certainly interesting. Khazan is a heroic character, that’s for sure, but he’s been condemned to death. You get to not only uncover why as you play through, but also see Khazan grow into something a bit different as he’s warped by the spirit possessing him and by the world around him. It’s just different enough to actually be worth paying attention too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The First Berserker: Khazan is a great action game that's not reinventing anything by any means, but is consistently fun to play. The visuals are lovely, the action is a lot of fun thanks to ever-evolving skill trees, and the boss designs are great too. If you're after a Soulslike challenge, it can fit that bill in some ways, but it should also have a broader appeal thanks to the easy mode and more.	</p></div>
