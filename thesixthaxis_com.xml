<p>Dead of Darkness is set on the fictional English island known as Velvet Island, and the year is 1985. The main character is private investigator Miles Windham, who has travelled to the island to find out why his sister died there. On its facade, the institution on Velvel Island is a hospital, but strip away that layer and it is a place of horror not healing. Much of the game will be based around puzzle solving, though there will be combat too in a bid to escape from various enemies and creatures. Some enemies will continue to pursue you so you will have to get away from them, and watch out. There are 15 characters that are on Velvet Island that have their own stories to tell too. Resource management will be a key focus in Dead of Darkness as there are not many items that will be available to help, so every encounter has to be planned for. Milesâ€™ mental state will also have a toll taken on it, the more powerful the hallucinations he will experience. As a investigator, Miles will need to piece together clues found around Velvet Island to discover its secrets, and work out what happened to his sister.</p>
<p>Dead of Darkness is available to wishlist and you can grab a demo through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2157210/Dead_of_Darkness/">Dead of Darkness Steam</a> page.</p>
