		<p>Rockstar has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed again, and is now coming out on 19th November 2026.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">the studio writes</a>, “but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</p>


<p>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> had previously been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">set for launch on 26th May 2026</a>, and while this was the first firm date that we had for launch from Take Two and Rockstar, it had come after the better part of a year of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs assuring</a>&nbsp;that the game was going to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>The studio has, quite awkwardly, been grabbing headlines for what has been lambasted as “brazen” union busting by leaders of the IWGB union who has been helping to coordinate unionisation efforts among employees. 30-40 employees were let go last week, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">Rockstar has claimed was for disclosing confidential details in a public forum</a>, though this is disputed by the IWGB. This will no doubt rumble on for a while to come.</p>

<p>The last we saw of GTA 6 came in May with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-a-second-trailer/">the game’s second trailer</a>:</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will take us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime story, featuring Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, who’s coming fresh out of prison, and Jason, who works with the local drugrunners after quitting the army.</p>
<p>The trailers have shown off the modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media influence and excesses feeding into the atmosphere, though that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>
