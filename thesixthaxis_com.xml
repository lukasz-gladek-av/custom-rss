		<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered, or DW3CER as no one is calling it, was set to be released on March 19th 2026, but that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>A message from producer Tomohiko Sho reads as follows:</p>


<p><em>“The release of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered has been postponed from the previously announced March 19th, 2026.&nbsp; As the first remaster of the Dynasty Warriors series,&nbsp; in order to satisfy our fans, we have made the decision to further improve the quality of the game. The new release date will be announced at a later date. We appreciate your patience as we take a little more time before the game releases”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered looks to retain the gameplay of the original game, but has been completely remade using Unreal Engine 5. The team has also reconsidered some of the gameplay and UI elements to refine the experience.</p>

<p>The remake includes the original game plus the Xtreme Legends expansion which includes more scenarios, officers such as Lu Bu, Meng Huo and Yuan Shao, four challenge modes and more weapons. That will boost the roster to over 40 officers who will be battling thousands of enemies all at once.&nbsp; Dynasty Warriors 3 was the first game in the series to feature mechanics that would become a mainstay for the series, such as True Musou Attacks, two-player simultaneous play, and the officer development system.</p>
<p>When it does eventually get released the game will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC.</p>
