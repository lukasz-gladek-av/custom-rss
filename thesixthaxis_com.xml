		<p>Activision and Xbox finished off their showcase with the reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, though you might initially have expected it to be a Heroes reboot as a video game as Milo Ventimiglia was front and centre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, he’s not playing Peter Petrelli this time around, he’s playing David Mason, who’s leading the Black Ops team against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else. The story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6, and looks like it could be bridging the divide to some of the ultra-futuristic themes of Black Ops 3. Or maybe it’s an Inception cross-over?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we had an absolutely fantastic time with Black Ops 6 last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">our review we said</a>, “Modern Warfare had a great run, but Black Ops is now back on top in their ongoing sibling rivalry. Fluid character movement, high-tempo multiplayer, evolved Zombies co-op, and an incredible campaign come together in 2024’s most irresistible first person shooter.”</p>
<p>We’re once again seeing Activision going back-to-back with their Call of Duty sub-franchises, so there will be some trepidation for Black Ops 7. Modern Warfare 2 and 3 went back-to-back, and the latter really suffered for it, with a poor campaign and this unusual expansion to the multiplayer, instead of a fully new mode.</p>

<p>We said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a>,&nbsp;“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 isn’t an outright bad game, but it’s also not a particularly good one. Taken on its own, it’s a slightly above average first person shooter with a poor campaign, but in context, you can see how hurried and limited in scope this game really is. The multiplayer is effectively a classic map pack, Zombies and Open Combat Missions are game modes built within the existing Warzone map, and the campaign’s pacing and story come up short. It all adds up to a lacklustre experience and even a sense that Call of Duty is at risk of losing its identity.”</p>
<p>So… let’s hope it’s good.</p>

		<p>Square Enix has finally deigned to bring the latest and greatest from the Final Fantasy franchise to Xbox. Final Fantasy VII Remake is in the works for Xbox Series X|S, but what’s this? Final Fantasy XVI is out on Xbox Series X|S today!</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Xbox this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - Coming to Xbox | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFNoIUEdsEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>And as mentioned, Final Fantasy XVI is out for Xbox today!</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI - Available on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox PC today | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAaJXiew1t0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI won&nbsp;our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year for 2023</a>, so it’s well worth checking out.</p>

<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/lanas-adventure-continues-in-planet-of-lana-2-children-of-the-leaf/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A sequel to one of the prettiest games of the last few years has been announced with Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S. PC and Xbox Game Pass in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf Announcement Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lana and Mui struck a firm and beloved bond in the first game and, with their home now saved, they’re off on a longer journey. Children of the Leaf is a major sequel that will double the original in size and scope, seemingly looking to introduce some combat mechanics, alongside the sneaking and outsmarting of those spider-bots?</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the original game, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/22/planet-of-lana-review/">our review</a>, “Planet of Lana looks and sounds as wonderful as its original reveal promised. While it doesn’t redefine the adventure platformer, the adorable partnership between Lana and Mui, the gorgeous art direction and sweeping soundtrack make this well worth experiencing.”</p>
