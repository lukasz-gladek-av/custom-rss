		<p>There’s a new update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which adds a new way to play through the game’s story with the chronological mode.</p>
<p>The new feature is added today in patch 2.1.0 for PS5 and patch 1.5 for the game on PC via Steam and Epic.</p>


<p>The Last of Us Part 2 was released with a story that plays out non-linearly, showing Ellie and Abby’s stories in a jumbled up order that also blends in flashbacks alongside the present-day story.</p>
<p>“Through the new Chronological mode,” Naughty Dog’s Jonathan Dornbush writes, “we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.”</p>
<p>The studio still recommends playing the game as it was originally put together, but this gives a potentially fresh perspective. If you do play this way, however, you will be able to unlock two new skins that dress Joel up as Nathan Drake and Tommy up as Sam Drake, made available for the No Return roguelike survival mode.</p>

<p>That this update even exists is an unusual one, coming half a decade after the game’s original launch on PS4, and in some ways it feels like this echoes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/04/going-back-to-beyond-two-souls-on-ps4/">the chronological story mode added to Beyond: Two Souls</a> for its PS4 remaster. It’s also strangely timed to release this after Season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, which inherited the non-linear story of the game. Surely if there was a time to reconsider how the tale was to be unspooled, it would have been through the TV series? Certainly, this could have helped with some of the most…. disliked narrative points in both game and TV show.</p>

<p>Looking back at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered’s release for PS5, Gamoc said, “The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered refines and improves a much misunderstood masterpiece. It’s hard not to be amazed at how good this game still looks, and it comes with a new mode and some behind the scenes stuff to enjoy. It’s not as big a step from the original release as TLOU Part 1 was, and so feels like a less noteworthy release, but the price for upgrading from PS4 is reasonable for what you get. For those who haven’t played it, this will be the best version to play, even if it’s just for No Return to add some more longevity without all the incredibly intense emotional stress of the main story.”</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the Ghost of Yōtei gameplay reveal State of Play stream will take place this Thursday, 10th July at 10PM UK time.</p>
<p>The State of Play stream will bring around 20 minutes of new Ghost of Yōtei gameplay, hosted by Sucker Punch Creative Directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox.</p>


<p>In particular, we can expect to see Atsu’s new weapons, how you can personalise your journey through Japan, new special modes and more hints at the game’s story.</p>
<p>So, tune in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation">the official YouTube channel</a> 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST on 10th July for all those juicy details.</p>
<p>But here’s what we know so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. Set in the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603, there’s a real Western vibe to some of the scenery and imagery that has been used for the game’s trailers.</p>
<p>That means there’s also a new Ghost to play as, named Atsu. Hers, as is so often the case for this kind of fiction, is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>
<p>Looking back on out original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, Aran said, “Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on 20th October for PS5.</p>
