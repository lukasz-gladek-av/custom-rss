		<p>Sony has announced the release date for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> game, which be created by Spider-Man developers, Insomniac.&nbsp; The game will launch on September 15th, 2026, exclusively on PS5 and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-1-marvels-wolverine/">number one in our “Most Wanted Games of 2026”.</a></p>

<p>“In this story, he is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him. Unfortunately, in this world, he’ll have to dig his claws deep to pull any shred of information that may lead to answers. Often, that means shredding into a relentless onslaught of enemies who aim to stop him by any means necessary,” say Insomniac.</p>
<p>Wolverine will, once again, be played by an Australian, this time, it is&nbsp; Liam McIntyre who is putting on the claws.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is being directed by Brian Horton (creative director) and Cameron Christian (game director), who were in charge of Spider-Man: Miles Morales and they have&nbsp;enlisted Walt D. Williams as story lead over at Insomniac Games. For those who don’t recognise the name, Williams worked as narrative director on 2012’s controversial <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>.</p>
<p>Why should gamers be excited for this news? Firstly, it underlines Insomniac’s intent to make Marvel’s Wolverine a game with a darker storyline, the developer having previously stated that it was aiming for a more mature tone compared to Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Aside from being a challenging third-person shooter with some interesting quirks, Spec Ops: The Line went rogue with its brutal, mind-being plot. Taking inspiration from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (which also heavily influenced Apocalypse Now) the campaign saw three elite operatives infiltrate a ravaged Dubai to thwart a rogue U.S colonel in the midst of a sandstorm. It’s been almost a decade since the game launched on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, though we still remember the controversial white phosphorous scene as well as the four potential endings.</p>

		<p>Blizzard has announced a new game in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch/">Overwatch</a> franchise called Overwatch Rush, which is a new mobile game. The game will be a top-down shooter rather than first-person, and it is in the early days of development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overwatch Rush | Early Development Gameplay Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_GNt0ILldw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Overwatch Rush is being developed by a dedicated team at Blizzard, separate from Team 4, all of whom have deep mobile experience,” say Blizzard. “Team 4 remains fully focused on Overwatch, which will continue to bring exciting and fresh new experiences for PC and console players in its recently launched Season 1 and beyond!”</p>
<p>“Overwatch Rush is an entirely new game – not a port – built specifically for mobile players. While there remains a lot of work to do, we’re eager to see how players enjoy what we’ve built so far, and to hear from them on what we should focus on in the coming phases of development. Our mission is to continue to expand the Overwatch universe by bringing fresh new adventures to players across all platforms. We’ll continue to keep you updated on how things are progressing.”</p>
<p>The team say they are “preparing for testing” in select countries and regions and interested players should join the <a href="https://discord.gg/overwatchrush">official Discord server.</a></p>

<p>Overwatch has just launched Season 1 which is a bit confusing considering it’s been out for years.</p>
<p><em>“For the first time in Overwatch history we’re telling a multi-faceted, fully-connected story across the entire year. You’ll experience a narrative arc with a set beginning, middle, and end, beginning with an all-new Season 1 through Season 6, before a new Season 1 launches in 2027. To tell this first story, we are releasing&nbsp;10 Heroes&nbsp;over the course of the year, with the&nbsp;first&nbsp;five&nbsp;joining the fight when&nbsp;Season 1 launches on February 10! Each of these new heroes will directly tie into the story for the year.”</em></p>
<p>So just to be clear, Season 1 has just started and runs the entire year until Season 1 starts in 2027.</p>
