		<p>During Nintendo’s Kirby Air Riders Direct, Nintendo confirmed that the game will available from November 20th on Switch 2. Kirby Air Riders is a racing game sequel to Kirby Air Ride which launched in 2003 for the Gamecube, with Masahiro Sakurai taking on the director duties of the game. If you want an in depth look at the game, you can watch the full Kirby Air Riders direct below.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders will feature a roster of 16 playable characters, including Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, and Starman. After choosing your character you can also choose different Air Machines, with each having various stats that affect speed and durability, meaning some will be better to use when facing off against opponents. Each character also has a unique special ability that can give an advantage during races, apart from Kirby who has four abilities depending on which colour Kirby you play as. While the abilities are unique, all characters have the Copy Ability which allows characters to steal and use each other’s abilities.</p>
<p>Skyah is the main area players will be able to travel across freely starting off with a rather weak Air Machine. In Skyah, players will be able to attack opponents and take part in different events all over the map including races and battles. If you don’t fancy spending all your time in Skyah you can head to the Stadiums and take part in different challenges, with some challenges being recommended based on your machine stats. Air Ride Mode is a race mode that has six racers compete against each other to cross the finish line first. There is also a Lessons mode which is essentially a tutorial mode where players can try out different machines and characters.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has officially announced Tales of Xillia Remastered, which is not too much of a surprise as a remaster was leaked a little while ago. This release is only Tales of Xillia Remastered, and there is no mention of a remaster for the follow up Tales of Xillia 2. Tales of Xillia Remastered will be released on October 31st for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch. You can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Xillia Remastered - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/feXG0jHLpU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tales of Xillia Remastered will have enhanced visuals and quality of life improvements including the option to turn off encounters, auto save, destination markers, early access to the Grade Shop, and all the original DLC including character costumes and bonus items. Tales of Xillia was the first Tales of game that allowed players to pick one of two protagonists to play as and experience the story from different viewpoints. That also meant that to really get the full picture playing through as both Jude and Milla was pretty much necessary.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/06/tales-of-xillia-review-ps3/">Tales Of Xillia Review</a></h2>
<p>In the original Tales of Xillia review from 12 years ago, I wrote, <em>“Tales Of Xillia is a brilliant title, and could just be the breakout game that really establishes the series in Western markets. There’s a great story here, with likable characters and voice acting that makes the characters feel real. The streamlined leveling, equipment choices and skill tree make Xillia one of the best RPGs I’ve played. In fact Tales Of Xillia may just be what the JRPG genre needed.”</em></p>

		<p>Commodore Amiga owners were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWBSnBsCW5Y">spoilt for superb shoot ’em ups</a> with original games such as&nbsp; Xenon II, Project X, Swiv,&nbsp; and Bloody Money, and superb arcade ports such as R-Type.&nbsp;One title that stood out from the crowd was Apidiya, a game that ditched spaceships and battle stations and replaced them with insects and ponds.&nbsp; It was totally unique and it’s coming back in almost exactly the same form.</p>
<p>Apidya Special is a full remake rather than an emulated version of the original Amiga title and it’s been developed by the original team, together with a devoted Apidya super-fan-turned-developer. The new version is based on an unreleased console port from the 90s, presumably the Sega Megadrive version, and uses the original assets along with brand new pixel art.&nbsp; There’s also a new version of the soundtrack by legendary 16-bit composer Chris Hülsbeck.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apidya' Special Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHiFhz-yJkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“We never thought we’d return to Apidya after all these years,” said Peter Thierolf, original creator of the game. “but with new technology, the right team, and the passion of the community, we can finally deliver the version we always dreamed about.”</p>
<p>While remaining true to the original game there some new features that have been added, check them out:</p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentic Remake</strong>&nbsp;– Completely rebuilt from scratch; no emulation.</li>
<li><strong>Two Visual Modes</strong>&nbsp;– Seamlessly switch between HD widescreen or original Amiga 4:3 presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive Chris Hülsbeck OST</strong>&nbsp;– Newly arranged soundtrack alongside remixed and classic tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Retro Visual Effects</strong>&nbsp;– Optional CRT shaders, bloom, and authentic scanline simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Worlds</strong>&nbsp;– 5 diverse themed worlds (Meadow, Pond, Sewers, Cyber, Lair), up to 5 levels each, 20 unique bosses, and hidden special stages.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Surprises</strong>&nbsp;– Randomized in-game events like “Night Mode” with new enemy sprites.</li>
<li><strong>Co-op Mode</strong>&nbsp;– Second player controls one of the helper drones.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Options</strong>&nbsp;– Modernized difficulty settings to make the game enjoyable for all generations (including the original devs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apidya Special will launch next year on PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Can someone please remake SWIV now? Pretty please?</p>
