		<p>Redemption Road’s barmy time-travelling medieval war game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> is set to hit Steam Early Access on 8th October 2025. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, uh, what’s going on there, then? Well, the future is about to crumble into an apocalypse, but there’s thankfully a chance to set things right by bouncing back in time 500 years and turning the tide of a brutal medieval war in England. You’ve got to change history, and since the chances of a time traveller just dying from stepping on a rusty nail and not having a tetanus shot are pretty much astronomical, you need to stack the odds in your favour by bringing some modern day toys with you.</p>
<p>Yup, that means running around with fully automatic assault rifles, RPGs, hopping onto motorbikes and into tanks that can just drive through stuff. With all of this at hand, you have a much better chance, but one man with a machine gun isn’t going to survive an enemy army, even if they are running at you with swords. So you can build cities and castles, recruit soldiers to your cause and raise armies to conquer the rest of the country, blending in RTS action with the third person battling.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can bring some friends with you too with support for up to 4 player co-op.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">announced back at Day of the Devs last June</a>, Kingmakers was then expected for a Q1 2025 early access release, but has naturally slipped back a fair bit to October. There’s real potential here to be that silly online co-op hit, though, so hopefully it arrives in good shape.</p>

		<p>Build A Rocket Boy and IOI Partners have released a big new explainer trailer for MindsEye, their ambitious open world shooter and user-generated content <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/mindseye-is-launching-in-everywhere-but-what-does-that-mean/">Everywhere</a> platform that is set to launch on 10th June for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of MindsEye takes place in Redrock City, a near future metropolis in which humans and machines battle for power and control, which is shown through the power struggle between Mayor Shiva Vega and tech genius Marco Silva, who is also the founder of the technology firm Silva Industries. Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his own past.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off plenty of cinematics from the story, missions that even take you up to space, and a whole bunch of third person shooter combat. In these segments, you’ll have plenty of conventional guns to choose from, but also have an AI drone buddy that can do area recon and stun enemies, hack evil I, Robot movie robots to fight alongside you and more.</p>
<p>It’s brought together by in-game “portals” branded Play.Mindseye to access moments from the official story and the open world, as well as hop into the “infinite entertainment” of user-generated missions through the PC-based Build.Mindseye tools. It’s a full-blown level and mission editor, providing the platform for people to make their own games. This is a part of the Everywhere platform, as mentioned above, a counterpart and rival to Fortnite’s UGC tools, and more presciently, to GTA 5 and the upcoming GTA 6.</p>

<p>At launch the game will have the single player content in free roam, as well as separate races, checkpoint races, and drone races. This will expand through content updates to add more missions, multiplayer (in the autumn), community updates and “special collaborations”. More will be added for those buying the premium edition of the game.</p>

<p>For such an ambitious title, it’s perhaps surprising that the marketing hasn’t been more intense. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">first revealed in February</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/mindseye-release-date-set-for-june-10th/">release date was only announced in March</a>, but this production is clearly setting its sights on Grand Theft Auto Online’s audience. That’s hardly surprisingly when the team was founded by Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar and producer on pretty much everything from GTA 3 through to GTA 5.</p>
<p>The run up to launch has also been quite restrained in terms of only granting preview to a select few YouTubers, from what we can see, and with no coverage from major gaming sites. Impressions were… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">less</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKKAMa6sXxE">than</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhWeYRoZl4E">favourable</a>. These previews were live, but remote and hands off, limiting the potential for appraisal.</p>
<p>So, uh… yeah, 10th June’s going to be interesting and we’re keen to go hands on for ourselves.</p>
