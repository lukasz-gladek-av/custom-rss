		<p>The first content update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-rally">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> has arrived, bringing an appropriate amount of snow and ice to the table for the season, alongside improved physics and performance. Available now, here’s what’s featured in Assetto Corsa Rally update 0.2.</p>
<p>The physics engine within Assetto Corsa has been evolved in multiple ways, with the headline being the introduction of snow physics and support for studded tyres. This allows you to take on ice and snow rallies where grip is at its lowest, and you can test your skill at the new Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit, as well as in time attack and free practice for these mountain roads.&nbsp;And what better way to take this on than with the newly introduced Alpine A110 Group 4, which is an icon of rallying in the early 1970s?</p>


<p>More broadly, the physics for gravel and tarmac racing have been improved alongside tyre models, and all vehicles benefit from fixes related to&nbsp;wheel offsets, rim textures, and suspension. The force feedback has also been made more consistent, especially for behaviour under braking. And the sound mix has been refined alongside new audio for snow environments and the A110.</p>
<p>To try all of this out, there’s two new Events groups, so there’s now a total of 25 events in AC Rally.</p>
<p>And then there’s just a litany of quality of life and bug fixing improvements. Here’s the full patch notes:</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is an exciting addition to Kunos Simulazioni’s sim-racing franchise, especially when rally racing is in flux after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">EA halting Codemasters’ rallying development</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/">KT Racing is revving back up to resume their WRC series</a>. While Kunos themselves are hard at work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa Evo</a>, AC Rally is in development at Supernova Games Studios in a technical partnership that builds on Kunos’ exceptional physics modelling. Similar to Assetto Corsa Competizioni, the visuals are then provided with a customised version of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
