		<p>EA and Activision are both set to clamp down harder on cheaters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> by requiring that PC gamers have TPM 2.0 hardware and have Secure Boot enabled within their system BIOS – this is also required for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/battlefield-6-launches-10th-october-see-the-multiplayer-trailer-beta-reveal-here/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a> that has just started today.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will lean on the latest version of Javelin Anticheat, while Black Ops 7 uses Activision’s Ricochet Anti-Cheat, both of which are kernel-level anti-cheat software. This provides the anti-cheat software deep level access to be able to spot and cut out cheating software in as many of its forms as possible.</p>


<p>Requiring Secure Boot takes things another step further, leaning on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is built into all modern CPUs and is a key component for Windows encryption and digital rights management. Having TPM 2.0 hardware is a requirement for Windows 11 (albeit one that’s easily skirted past), but Secure Boot is technically optional, even if it does provide greater system integrity and security.</p>
<p>The further issue is that both EA and Activision are patching in the newer version of Javelin and Ricochet into previous games. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both require Secure Boot now, while EA added Secure Boot as a requirement for Battlefield 2042, and have previously rolled Javelin out for BF1 and BFV.</p>
