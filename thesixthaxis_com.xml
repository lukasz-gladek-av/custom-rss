		<p>Sony has revealed the Days of Play 2025 promotion, running from 28th May through 11th June to coincide with Summer Games Fest, and bringing discounts for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> consoles, accessories, games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a>.</p>
<p>This includes some significant sale pricing on PlayStation 5 consoles. In the US and Canada, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 bundle is starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD for the digital edition, saving up to $120 if bought separately. Meanwhile, standalone consoles in Europe and Asia will also be on sale, starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980 for the digital edition. There will also be a $50 USD discount on the PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>That’s potentially a good set of savings, bringing the price of the digital consoles down significantly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">below what the MSRP was</a> prior to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">the price hikes in April this year</a>. I’m not sure why Sony aren’t saying the price of disk drive consoles, outside of “starting from” giving lower numbers.</p>
<p>There will also be offers for PS5 accessories and games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 USD off PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li>
<li>$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off Access controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Discounts will also be rolling out through the PlayStation Store on hundreds of games, and there’s also some savings to be had on PlayStation Plus. New subscribers can save up to 33% on a 12-month membership, though this will depend on region and tier – PS Plus Essential typically only has a 20% discount in these deals now, though Sony has not yet stated what the discount will be, sticking with the “up to” descriptor.&nbsp;If you upgrade from PS Plus Essential or Extra to PS Plus Premium, then you will also save 33%.</p>

<p>Sony’s revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/">PS Plus Monthly Games for June</a>, with a bonus fourth title, the Destiny 2: The Final Shape year-long expansion.</p>
<p>For PS Plus Extra, games added through the next fortnight include Another Crab’s Treasure (PS5), Skull and Bones (PS5), Destiny 2: Legacy Collection (PS5, PS4) and Grand Theft Auto III (PS4, PS5). Meanwhile, Myst and Riven are added to the PS Plus Premium Classics library.&nbsp;There’s also PS Plus trials for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII.</p>

		<p>Sony is kicking off the Days of Play promotion for June, and as part of that, they’ve announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games. There’s four games this time, including the spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, with the added freebie being Destiny 2: The Final Shape, which is actually available from tomorrow!</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus June 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>Three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 3rd June and they will be available until 30th June. That fourth game, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, will be available from tomorrow, 28th May.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NBA 2K25</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Alone in the Dark (2024)</strong> | PS5 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available May 28)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go in reverse order. <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></strong> is the culmination of a ten year epic story woven by Bungie… though it’s not the end of the game, with more expansions and content still coming to the online looter shooter. Still, for many, The Final Shape was a fitting end to the tale and characters. In our review, Tuff said, “The Final Shape is Destiny 2 back to its best for its grand narrative finale. It’s the ultimate space wizards with a machine gun fantasy combined with emotional story beats and characters you truly care for. Despite all the odds, Bungie has crafted the perfect endgame.”</p>


<p>We don’t actually have a review of <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberpunk</strong>, but the 2023 game is a spiritual successor to the coolest Dreamcast game out there, Jet Set Radio. Coming from Team Reptile, you’re kitted out with bootpacks and set into the streets to dance, graffiti, collect beats, and combo tricks together in New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Trading beats and streets for squeaks and courts, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/nba-2k25-review/"><strong>NBA 2K25</strong></a> “is both a great and a frustrating experience,” Aran said. “Beneath the layers of VC and the slow grind is a very good basketball game. The presentation is top notch and MyGM is the best mode to play to get the full NBA experience. MyCareer can be fun and it is a shame it is so bogged down where players have to choose to grind very slowly to improve, or to spend quite a bit of additional money to improve their players.”</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a></strong> reboot from Pieces Interactive, which Jim said, “While it’s great to witness the return of survival horror royalty, Alone in the Dark haphazardly follows modern genre trends where it once invented them. While it mostly succeeds at drawing players into a Lovecraftian mystery, it’s hard to ignore the underbaked action elements used to patch these story beats together.”</p>
