            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tencent have rebuffed Sony’s claims that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a> is a “slavish clone” of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon franchise</a> and that it copies multiple elements from they games that would confuse consumers.&nbsp; Sony asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram, Tencent are asking for the whole thing to be thrown out of court.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants—about the unreleased video game&nbsp;Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony’s game&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn and its spinoffs,” the complaint reads, according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">TheGamePost.</a></p>
<p>“At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony’s exclusive domain.”</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the rest of the legal waffle but the short version is that Tencent claim that elements such as a red-haired heroine, robotic creatures, and ruined cities are tropes that can be found in many video games, and they give examples such as Far Cry, BioMutant, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>. Sony themselves published a Ninja Theory game with a red haired heroine, Heavenly Sword, but that doesn’t get a mention.</p>

<p>“In Sony’s telling, Horizon Zero Dawn is ‘like no fictional world created before [or] since.’ That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolize through this lawsuit,” say Tencent.</p>
<p>That line about Sony’s own developers may be a problem for the PlayStation giant. Sony released a documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn, and in it, Jan-Bart Van Beek, the art director for the game, references Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and suggests the new Horizon title is similar: “I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points.”</p>
<p>“Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game,” say Tencent.&nbsp;Enslaved is an action game with mechanical beasties set in a ruined landscape but the hero is male, the red-haired character, Trip, is not playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved: Odyssey to the West - PS3  Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzwQX_orYf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at Enslaved at first glance it does resemble Horizon but I don’t think Tencent have much of a chance, Sony’s complaint isn’t really about claiming all the individual elements are their own, they are claiming the combination of all these things, along with the art style and music, make Light of Motiram a copy of Horizon.&nbsp; Their claim is comparable to a claim over music copyright; there are only so many notes and everyone uses them, but if you put them in the same order as someone else, then you are making a copy.</p>
<p>Tencent have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page</a> and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine.</p>
<p>Now, can we please, please have that remaster of Enslaved now?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two of the best co-op games of all time launch today on Nintendo Switch]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/two-of-the-best-co-op-games-of-all-time-launch-today-on-nintendo-switch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do like to play co-op games. Luckily for me, there’s enough of us kicking around in TSA towers that we’re able to generally find someone of a similar mind to play a game with. If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably pretty used to the odd spot of co-op too, and that’s about to get better as today marks the launch of two of the greatest co-op puzzle adventures of all time, appearing for the first time for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Those games are the iconic We Were Here and We Were Here Too, the first two games in the We Were Here series. </p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here &amp; We Were Here Too Launch Trailer I Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUn4X9HajDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frankly, if you’ve got a co-op buddy to call on, I’d tell you to just go and pick them up now, but if not, then here’s a little context in order to get you interested. The We Were Here series has captivated players with its co-op puzzle designs and challenging duos to think outside the box since 2017, when We Were Here launched as a free game that has now been downloaded almost 10 million times. </p>
<p>Since then, the We Were Here series has been enjoyed by more than 20 million players. We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip is the latest release and it broke all previous records out of the water by hitting more than 8 million downloads within its first year. The puzzling adventures are playable in any order, although a common narrative thread runs through them.</p>
<p>Communication and lateral thinking are your two biggest weapons in the We Were Here series, and things are made all the more interesting by physically having to activate the in-game walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammate. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans on the way to solving each puzzle, and there’s just such a strong sense of identity and visual design that you can’t help but be drawn ever further into its idisyncratic world. </p>

<p>Players can pre-purchase the third entry of the series, We Were Here Together, on September 25 in the Nintendo eShop. A demo will then also be playable from September 25 to 28 at the Total Mayhem Games booth at Tokyo Game Show. The release of We Were Here Together will follow on October 9.</p>
<p>The We Were Here series, including We Were Here, We Were Here Too, and We Were Here Together, has also undergone significant enhancements. These include a visual overhaul, updated user interface, expanded settings, additional language translations, bug fixes, and cross-platform compatibility with PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. These updates are also making their way to other platforms, with full implementation expected by 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>﻿The We Were Here games will be fully compatible with Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2. A Nintendo Switch Online Membership and a headset with a microphone (or a different way to communicate with your partner) will be required to play the We Were Here Series on Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>
