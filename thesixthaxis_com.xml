		<p>You know you’ve been watching too much NFL when the Six Nations kicks off and you get mildly confused by the try and conversion scores, and think that the yellow cards look soft – though there’s very good reasons for being that strict!</p>
<p>Pour one out for any Welsh friends and relatives you have after last night’s opener, but today should provide some fun for the Scottish and Irish out there.</p>
<p>But on to the video games news of the week.</p>

		<p>The PC port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> launched on Thursday, but the game has had a “Mixed” reception in the Steam user reviews as many players complain about performance, graphical issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Sony leant on their in-house porting team at Nixxes to handle the port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, but while they traditionally have a good reputation for their PC ports, this one has fallen flat, joining a number of other PlayStation PC ports that have had a rocky landing.</p>


<p>We’re working on our own impressions of the PC port, but just to grab <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/765Tet/recommended/2651280/">one </a>of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">the many negative Steam reviews</a>, “I have an RTX 4070ti, on high graphics and no raytracing I get crashes […] Even when it’s not crashing, shadows flicker for no good reason and it feels like it struggles to render hair at times.”</p>
<p>Part of this is down to performance. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/10/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-review/">Spider-Man Remastered</a> and Miles Morales were well received for their performance, those games fundamentally had the PS4 platform as the base target for Insomniac’s original creation, and were designed with ray tracing as an additive feature. Spider-Man 2 only launched for PS5 and so could always feature ray tracing, could always rely on the fast NVMe SSD loading times, and the fundamental uplift that the console provided.</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2’s PC port actually scaled back down to GPUs without ray-tracing features, with a broad set of hardware and performance targets to go from 720p30 up to full 4K with “Ultimate” ray tracing.</p>

<p>The problems that players are encountering seem to run the full gamut, and affect both Nvidia and AMD GPUs alike with performance dips, frame rate stutters and running out of VRAM even with a 16GB card. The majority of PC gamers have gone with Nvidia, and with many newly implemented graphical options seem to come plenty of problems.</p>
<p>Odd driver issues can lead to full-blown crashes citing GPU temperatures. Elsewhere Nvidia’s bespoke ray reconstruction for improving ray traced reflections and certain other DLSS features are claimed to actually reduce frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198820911436/recommended/2651280/">One user has a potential performance aid,</a> saying “Before you play, open the install folder of the game,make a new folder and drag dsstorage.dll and dsstoragecore.dll into the new folder to improve load times, low fps and micro freezes!”</p>
<p>Essentially, this ditches the game’s use of Direct Storage, which has certain requirements for SSD speeds and technology. It’s not clear how this would help, as in theory it would reduce SSD read performance, but perhaps there are some bugs with the system.</p>
<p>As for the other issues, turning down ray-tracing effects and relying less on DLSS features that use AI to fill in the blanks seems to have an effect. In general, it feels like players will want to wait for a patch from Nixxes and a fresh driver update from Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia is also juggling a new GPU generation launch and adding more trickery to their drivers right around now.</p>
