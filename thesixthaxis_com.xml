		<p>It’s pinch, punch, first of the month time, and since it’s November, I hope you managed to survive last night with only treats and no tricks. Thankfully my supply of sweets was just enough to survive the glut of kids of all ages knocking on our door, so I didn’t have to break into my <em>actual</em> stash of sweets to appease the last kids in the final crowd that knocked.</p>
<p>But now that we’re free from this terror, what’s on the agenda for this weekend? Perhaps some ARC Raiders? Maybe avoiding the Battlefield battle royale? Perhaps some Football Managering?</p>

And we’re still holding our final verdict on Football Manager 26, with Sports Interactive regularly pushing patches live ahead of the full release next week, but you can catch Aran’s <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/road-to-review-football-manager-26/">Road to Review</a></strong> if you want to know more.</p>

<p>I also got to check out What The Stars Forgot, an indie game blending Star Trek, FTL and horror together, while Steve had some thoughts on the headless FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/davy-x-jones-early-access-review/"><strong>Davy X Jones</strong></a>, and Jim pondered <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign/">if it’s worth playing the Battlefield 6 campaign</a>.</p>
<p>And since it’s spooky season, Steve had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/31/7-indie-horror-games-to-ease-the-wait-for-resident-evil-requiem/"><strong>a bunch of indie horror games</strong></a> for you to check out while still waiting for Resident Evil: Requiem next year.</p>

		<p>Supergiant Games has announced that it has released its first major update for Hades II since the game launched properly. The list is very extensive covering things like the true ending, fixes to various items, and changes to a few encounters with other characters. Beware, if you have not yet played or completed Hades II then this is your SPOILER ALERT! Do not venture past the trailer if you do not want any surprised ruined. The rest of you, feel free to proceed.</p>
