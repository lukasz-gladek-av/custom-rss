		<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the RPG rendition of the hit The Expanse TV and book series that we’ve all been waiting for. Coming from Owlcat Games, this is a story-driven RPG with third person tactical action gameplay that… well, the comparisons with Mass Effect are inevitable, aren’t they?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Best known for their CRPGs <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/21/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition-review/">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/01/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-beta-brings-crpg-goodness-to-the-grimdark-future/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, Owlcat is shifting gears for their adaptation of The Expanse. While the first three quarters of the announcement trailer are a lavishly rendered cinematic, the final section shows snippets of pre-alpha gameplay to give an indication of what to expect.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting:</p>

<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that The Expanse has been adapted to video games – that would be the 2023 Telltale game – but it is a fitting return to the sci-fi world’s roots. Ty Franck – one half of the writing duo behind the pen-name James S.A. Corey – famously conceived of the setting first as a setting for an MMORPG and then a tabletop RPG, running a test game with a group of friends that eventually became the basis for the first novel’s story. It’s always nice when things come right back around, isn’t it?</p>
