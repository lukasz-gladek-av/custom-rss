		<p>I don’t think it is too much of a surprise that Nacon has confirmed Terminator: Survivors will not be releasing in 2025 given how close we are to the end of the year, and the lack of news over the past while. Nacon has also stated there is no confirmed new release date, and there will be some changes to the game too. The major changes are that Terminator: Survivors will now not have a co-op multiplayer mode, and there will be no Early Access. Instead, Nacon is changing its plans to release the game in full in one go.</p>

<p>In a statement, Nacon said, <em>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. We know this may come as a disappointment, but&nbsp;we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access,&nbsp;we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience. You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date. <wbr>Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so&nbsp;we’ll be organizing several closed playtests&nbsp;(under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors,&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.nacongaming.com%2Fplaytests">you can sign up here</a>.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator: Survivors is a sequel to Terminator 2. The story is set in 2009, a time before John Connor’s resistance has risen up against the machines. You are a survivor and do not have much information as to what brought about the apocalypse. However, as you build up your base and scavenge through the surrounding areas, the narrative running through the game will see you learn about SkyNet, about the emerging resistance and more. The game has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

		<p>Back in November, Brigada Games delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-release-has-been-delayed/">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check&nbsp;</a>after getting feedback from playtesters. The team was still aiming to get the game out for 2025, but has not been able to meet that goal. However, the release date for Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is not that far off with that confirmed for January 12th. It has been priced at $19.99.</p>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is set in a world that is facing a zombie outbreak, and you are a checkpoint guard. Your job is to stop anyone infected with the zombie virus, as well as anyone carrying contraband, from passing your checkpoint to a safe zone. Fail and it could lead to catastrophe. As a guard, players are equipped with scanners to detect the virus, but other resources are limited so decisions will need to be made to keep the camp safe.</p>
<p>If you want to give Quarantine Zone: The Last Check a try there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">demo available on Steam</a>. More news about the game and some ways to address the challenges will be released ahead of the release date.</p>

		<p>Paradox ARC, the indie publishing arm of Paradox Interactive, has announced alongside developer CoolAndGood Games that it will no longer be publishing the space sim Starminer. CoolAndGood Games will continue developing the game independently, but a reason for the split has not been given. Back in October, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/starminer-will-require-more-development-time-before-early-access-release/">Starminer would require more development time before early access release.</a></p>

<p>In a statement, Paradox ARC said,<em> “After several years working together on Starminer, Paradox ARC and CoolAndGood Games have mutually agreed to part ways. CoolAndGood Games will continue development independently and will continue independently as they move towards the release of Starminer. We want to extend our sincere thanks to the CoolAndGood Games team. Building a game is always a journey, and we’re grateful for the vision and dedication they’ve brought to Starminer and our collaboration. To everyone who has followed Starminer’s development so far: thank you for being part of this journey with us. Your enthusiasm and support have meant a great deal. On our end, we’ll be cheering them on from the sidelines as they continue developing Starminer.”</em></p>
<p>CoolAndGames Games also released a statement saying, <em>“After several years of developing Starminer together with our publishing partner, we at CoolAndGood Games will be continuing forward on our own as we prepare for the game’s upcoming release in February. <wbr>We want to thank our friends at Paradox ARC for their support, collaboration, and belief in the project. Starminer has grown a great deal since it was announced, and we’re grateful for the foundation we built together. <wbr>For our community; your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable. Starminer has always been a project driven by passion, and your participation has helped shape the development of the game. As we move into the project’s next phase, we’re committed to delivering the best version of Starminer we can, and we can’t wait to show you what’s coming next!”</em></p>

<p>A release date for Starminer is yet to be confirmed.</p>
