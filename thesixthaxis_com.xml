		<p>We’ve always been huge Futurlab fans here at TheSixthAxis, and it’s nice to have a bit of Thursday action from the team behind Velocity and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>. For fans of spraying things down, bringing things up to a sheen and climbing on small footladders to see onto ledges, today is a good day, with the announcement of PowerWash Simulator 2, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First and foremost, all that soaking action will look better than ever, with an improved set of visuals, a whole new campaign and, of course, new locations and items for you to clean down. The new campaign will have you uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries, as well as have you visiting grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a new home space – presumably you can clean this up too – and here you’ll be able to display awards and trinkets that you’ve gained while doing a hard days cleaning.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, you can now share campaign progression online together for the first time, and in addition to online play, split-screen co-op will be available as well, meaning you can clean digital homes together, while neglecting your own.</p>


<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>
<p>Futurlab have promised more details in April, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for all your PowerWash Simulator 2 news.</p>
