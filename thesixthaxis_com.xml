		<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance is going to be delisted, Tuque Games and Wizard of the Coast have confirmed. The game will be available until February 24th, 2025 and then will be removed from all digital storefronts on that day. The online servers will also be switched off, though the single player campaign will still be playable for those who own Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance.</p>

<p>In a statement the team said, “We will be shutting down (shut down) the Dark Alliance servers on 2/24/2025 and it will no longer be available to purchase starting that day. The base game and all DLC are still available to play in offline single player by anyone who currently owns it.”</p>

<p>In our Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance review, Reuben said, <em>“Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance fails to live up to both the potential of its placement in the D&amp;D canon and the legacy of the Dark Alliance name. As a mediocre-to-good game, depending on whether you’re alone or with friends, the whole experience is sluggish and dull in execution, and sails close to the average tabletop D&amp;D session where you play for four hours and somehow only walk down a single corridor, but without the enjoyment that comes with that experience.”</em></p>

		<p>Lost Soul Aside has re-emerged after quite the silence, and there is a new trailer confirming that the game will be out in 2025 for PS5 and PC. Lost Soul Aside first appeared on the radar back in 2016 for PS4, and was originally set to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/24/lost-soul-aside-becomes-timed-exclusive-on-ps4/">coming out in 2018</a>. The last we heard of the game was in 2021, when it was confirmed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/lost-soul-aside-final-fantasy-style-game-ps5/">Lost Soul Aside would be getting a PS5 release</a>.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside has been inspired by the Final Fantasy series as well as other RPGs and action games, with the story centred around the hero trying to save his sister, and all of humankind, in a world that is being invaded by forces from another dimension. It is a single player action-adventure RPG with fast paced combat using weapons and abilities, which will come in handy against the world of interdimensional invaders and bosses.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is a project from &nbsp;solo developer Bing Yang, who has been building up Lost Soul Aside which would explain why it has taken so long to come close to release.</p>
