		<p>Modding has been around for almost as long as video games themselves, as other curious developers, hackers and fans keenly delving into game code and assets to twist them in new directions. For racing games, the most obvious mods add cars and tracks alongside the existing roster shipped by developers, and the most active modding scenes have been built up around more sim-minded racing games on PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rennsport">Rennsport</a> is about to ask “why not on console too?”</p>
<p>As part of the game’s roadmap through 2026 and beyond, Competition Company is going to open up modding to the community, releasing tools to first allow track creation and eventually cars and gameplay modding too. The distinguishing factor between this game and its rivals will be that, in addition to still allowing custom mods on PC, they also plan to bring mod distribution in-game and expose them to console players as well.</p>
<p>“I think it does a lot for making it feel more seamlessly integrated into the game,” said Senior Lead Technical Artist, Joel Szlema. “For me, it’s a difference if I upload a track and next week it might just show up on the front page as, like, the next race coming up, right? That feels more like you’re directly contributing to the game, rather than put something up that people might find, might download. So it feels very connected in the fact that it’s just directly goes into the game.”</p>
<p>That’s potentially very exciting. Rennsport already features some community-created tracks that have been licensed by Competition Company to be a part of the game – Crest da Cauras, Orchard Road Street Circuit and the upcoming Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit. However, opening up modding and track distribution more freely will hopefully open the taps for a bunch of further tracks to be introduced, and then be easily discovered and featured in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit | NEW TRACK" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xV0UqpasGdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Joel presented how Rennsport’s modding tools will start off, combining Unreal Engine’s SDK with custom tools created by Competition Company, providing a rounded suite of tools to create new tracks for the game. This will initially be opened up to a small group of creators this summer, before the net is widened in a closed beta, and with a full release pencilled in for the end of 2026. After that, they will turn their attentions to modding cars and modding gameplay, though not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>Tracks are an easier starting point for Rennsport to tackle on multiple levels, especially when bearing in mind that mods will also be coming to console. Content needs to be moderated to appear on console, there are limitations to how things can be modded, and that’s all before any kind of licensing issues with car makers and track owners wanting to protect their IP.</p>
<div id="attachment_469268"><p id="caption-attachment-469268">The Kuala Lumpur circuit is a community-created track coming to Rennsport soon, and this could just be the start</p></div>
<p>“Once the tracks are done, we will definitely look into probably gameplay next. I feel like gameplay is something that it also naturally goes into, because if you can do tracks and you can you can put a contest config on the track, then you can already do quite a lot of like different experiences, right? Because we do have some tracks that are not like closed loop tracks, so you could do something that looks like a rally stage, for example.”</p>
<p>“And with that, you could naturally, I mean, it’s kind of a stupid example, but I always bring the example of an obstacle course. You could just make a level that looks like an obstacle course, and it’s A-to-B and it’s still like whoever finishes first finishes first, but you’ve kind of created a different game modes just by making a different track with some gameplay rules.”</p>
<div id="attachment_469280"><p id="caption-attachment-469280">Placing obstacles or making A-to-B races could be the foundations for new gameplay mods.</p></div>
<p>With an eye to wider gameplay mods, Joel said, “So in theory, there’s a lot of things you can do [on console]. The only thing is that you have to [make it] safe, that nobody does, like, code injection on console to hack the console or whatever. What you can do is you can create basically like an API, or you can, for example, if you have a spawn point in game, you can build a spawn point like a modular block, you programme it, and then people can like place it in a level, right? Or they can build stuff around it. So you have to do, like, defined building blocks that people can combine to make new logic out of it.</p>
<p>“Unreal has blueprints where you can, I don’t know if you know, you can programme with nodes or you place a node, like spawn something and press something and you can connect them. And I don’t think we would be able to allow people to use that freely, but if we make our own predefined building blocks, then you could potentially do that.”</p>

<p>One of the major changes to the modding community over the past decade, is that modders are able to ask for some kind of payment, whether it’s through their own subscriptions or one-off payments. Surely that can’t mesh with Rennsport having an in-game browser on consoles, though, can it? Those would need to be free to download?</p>
<p>“No,” said co-founder and co-CEO Marco Ujhasi. “So there is a difference for the console about the certification process, if it’s paid or unpaid content, that’s true. […] The general principle is when something is created, you can decide if it’s free or if it’s paid, and there is a way on any platform. [It can be] more or less complicated and it’s like with many topics, sometimes it gets so complicated, it’s not worth it, but technically possible.</p>
<p>“So what we are doing at the moment is, first and foremost, enabling the system and make it make it a fun thing to use. Because I think this is missing a bit, that it really feels like it’s part of the game. It’s not just about bringing the content in, but also what you can do with the content. Is it part of any progression system?</p>
<p>“And for us, it’s important that it’s really part of the whole game and the monetising? Honestly speaking, this is a side thing in that. But so many creatives sitting out there and talent and so on, and they do so much great stuff while we shouldn’t help them to make it in a more appealing appealing way. Why not?”</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of aspects of modding and distribution for Competition Company to really hammer out, I feel, but the core principles of having an in-game mod browser and ways to integrate them into the wider game more seamlessly for console is really an exciting one. Alongside the general roadmap of new cars and tracks being made by the team, modding is absolutely an aspect to keep an eye on as they evolve the tools and systems over the coming years.</p>

		<p>Rennsport really didn’t get off to the greatest start for a racing game, but its developers are determined to put things right with a newly revealed roadmap for 2026, an AI overhaul and modding tools in the works, and a new mantra of “Double the content –&nbsp;Half the price” to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Stepping into the simulation racing genre is a tall task, as you need to try and cater to the varying preferences and demands of a keen and deeply invested audience, but for its launch in November 2025, Rennsport simply came up short. Not enough cars, not enough tracks, a slim set of single player championships, and AI that would launch itself through fast corners, seemingly without braking, and end up cartwheeling through the sky.</p>
<p>The first level that they’re pulling is to reset the expectations and value within the game. The Deluxe Edition price is being slashed by 45% and will now feature the first three paid DLC packs released through 2026 –&nbsp;the Endurance Classics Part 1, Touring Classics Part 1 and now also a September DLC. Current Deluxe Edition owners will have further in-game items given to them as compensation for the price they previously paid.</p>



<p>But all owners will benefit from the free updates from March through May, adding the Hyundai N Vision 74 and Porsche 718 Cayman GT4, iconic tracks like Laguna Seca, Sebring International and a community-derived Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit, and updated and new single player championships, and further improvements through the game’s multiplayer features. The capper to all of this will be the reworked AI arriving in May, a ground-up rebuild of this element in the game.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with some of this new content at an event in Munich, spending the most time in the game with the Porsche 911 GT1 ’98 and Circuit Des 24 Heures Du Mans, both of which are featured in the Endurance Classics DLC. I’m someone that loves Le Mans and endurance racing as a sport, and this combination (admittedly with the current layout instead of that of the late 90s) was a joy to experience. Isn’t it always?</p>

<p>The rest of the DLC pack will feature the Porsche’s counterpart in the Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM, as well as the older Porsche 956 and current Peugeot 9X8 Evo. May will follow this up with a classic touring car bundle, the iconic Mercedes-Benz 190E and other cars able to take to the Hockenheimring Classic layout.</p>
<p>They’re good additions… free and paid, and the impact should hopefully be pretty swift for the multiplayer side of the game. The various added single player championships, though, will be beholden to the reworked AI coming in May.</p>
<p>The new AI wasn’t available for us to race against just yet, but the approach they are taking was outlined by Lead Gameplay Programmer Rikard Häggström. Instead of leaning into a machine learning approach to programmatically find the fastest racing line and learn to race, the AI is given the optimal racing line to try and follow, but then given situational awareness of other cars –&nbsp;visualised in the demo with laser beams zapping everything of note –&nbsp;to let them try to react more organically. They will also be driving with the same throttle, brake and steering inputs players have, and while there’s a slightly simplified physics model that they use compared to players, there won’t be any “cheating” mechanisms. While it’s expected in May, this could change depending on how development progresses.</p>
<div id="attachment_469268"><p id="caption-attachment-469268">The Kuala Lumpur circuit is a community-created track coming to Rennsport soon</p></div>
<p>The cherry on top, though, could be the modding support that will be added through 2026 and the years to follow. Modding and the ability for fans to add in additional cars, tracks and more to games, has been a major part of various PC racing games, but never really on console. Rennsport is looking to change that with an in-game asset store and manager to go alongside a growing suite of modding tools.</p>
<p>For this year, the focus is all about track modding tools. Built around Unreal Engine 5, the available tools are already robust, but will be combined with Rennsport’s in-house tools for better manipulating the tracks. The very first access to this will be in June for select creators, before expanding with a closed beta in August and a wider release potentially by the end of the year. From there, the modding focus will shift to gameplay and cars, over the next few years.</p>

<p>It’s ambitious for a number of reasons, not least that the most popular mods are now often supported via Patreon and other monetisation methods. To draw those talents to Rennsport, there’s the possibility that Competition Company’s in-game mod browser will also have to act like a shop and not just a platform for discovery. Needless to say there’s a lot of details still to be figured out with how to implement all of this, but it’s a fascinating direction to take, especially with console gamers in mind.</p>
<p>Rennsport is far from the only game to have had a rocky launch and need to pull off a recovery drive to get back to relevance. There’s earnest ambition behind this racing game, though, and a determination to improve the fundamentals while also broadening the horizons for the future.</p>
