		<p>GSC Game Worlds has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> patch 1.0.1, the studio working hard to patch out the wide array of bugs, quirks, progress blockers and glitches that players have encountered with the long-awaited sequel.</p>
<p>This is the first post-launch patch with over 650 different bugs and issues addressed across both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, though the studio acknowledges that there’s a good bit more work still to do. In particular, they highlight fixes for the A-Life bugs, which have affected the ambient interactions with creatures and different factions in the game.</p>


<p>Still, this is a great first step for the studio, and it must be said that the issues we encountered while reviewing were not game-breaking, but more on the amusing quirks end of the spectrum. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a> here.</p>
