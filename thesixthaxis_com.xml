		<p>The travails of Grand Theft Auto 6 really are a sign of just how much game development has changed over the decades. There were three GTAs on PS2, there were two on PS3, and now we’re lucky to see one big game a generation from Rockstar – I think we ought to really count Red Dead Redemption 2 in this. It’s something that’s echoed by the likes of Naughty Dog, where the most prestigious studios now take what feels like forever to produce their games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m talking about that because GTA 6 got delayed by another six months.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week, closely followed by the back and forth over work unionisation at Rockstar. Let’s get to those and all the other biggest stories we’ve caught.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman </strong>told us tales of Conquistadorio and Thimbleweed Park, the former having more of a Machinarium tone, and the latter being akin to a classic LucasArts point and clicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>

		<p>Halo Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> has reached the end of the road as a live service, with Operation: Infinite set to be the last major content update when it arrives on 18th November.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview#thankyou">team writes</a>, “As we look back on four years of evolution and updates in Halo Infinite, we’d like to thank our community for your steadfast support. Without your feedback and enthusiasm, Halo Infinite multiplayer would not be the special place it is today: a robust arena for slaying and playing, with something for every Spartan.</p>


<p>“With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p>
<p>This final content update will bring a&nbsp;2X boosts to Career Rank and SP, a 100-tier Operation Pass, eight armour sets to earn, new Ranked Seasons, and 200 new customisations in The Exchange.</p>
<p>Following this, the game will still be receiving stability updates, and Halo Studios will continue to support it with rotating in-game challenges to let you progress through the Operation Passes that will remain available, and there will be new ranked rewards, ranked seasons and community events. There just won’t be any more big content drops and battle passes.</p>

<p>This is in large part down to Halo Studios needing to put more resources toward their upcoming projects. A lot is being made of the studio’s old plan for Halo Infinite to be a 10-year game, but that plan was made at a very different time with different studio leadership, and grand aspirations for the Xbox Series X|S generation. But Halo Infinite then suffered a difficult launch, the Xbox Series has struggled, and Microsoft has dramatically changed its plans. For Halo, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/343-industries-is-now-halo-studios-announces-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/">studio has jumped across to developing in Unreal Engine 5</a>, it’s rebranded from 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo: Campaign Evolved has been announced</a> – a remake of the first game in UE5 that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series and PC. There’s also another mooted live service game rumoured to be in the works.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Halo Infinite through its first year or so, but it’s actually a little bit surprising that the studio stuck it out this long.</p>
