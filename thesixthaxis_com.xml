		<p>The rhythm-loving armies of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a> are marching forth again, as Patapon 1+2 Replay will remaster the PSP classics for Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on 11th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtnxA61V6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is great news for fans of the cult classic rhythm-action games, but there’s a twist. This pair of PlayStation Portable classics are being published on Switch, not by Sony, but by Bandai Namco instead. The new remasters are being developed by SAS Co. Ltd, who I cannot find any details about.</p>
<p>Combining the first two Patapon games into one bundle (though sadly not Patapon 3), you’re cast as a god looking down on the silhouetted tribe of the Patapon. Having been driven from their home by the Zigoton, you will take control and help guide them back to their rightful place by beating a war drum in certain rhythms to command your troops, telling them to march forward, attack, defend and more. Combine that with unlocking and commanding different units, and you’ll have to overcome monsters in the wild, assault Zigoton fortresses and more. Sticking to the beat with your button presses consistently enough, and your army will enter a FEVER! and boost their fervent abilities.</p>
<p>New for this remastered collection are some difficulty settings – Normal, Easy and Hard – adjustments for button timing to help with input lag, and a constant command display, so you don’t have to remember the specific commands.</p>

<p>Originally developed by Japan Studio – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">which Sony shut down in the last couple years</a> – the games were a pretty much essential part of the PSP library. Sony revisited the games with a remaster of the original in 2017 and the sequel in 2020, both for PS4, but the game’s natural home really is on a handheld, if you ask me.</p>
<p>“As special as it was ten years ago,” Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/07/patapon-remastered-review/">our 2017 review</a>, “Patapon Remastered is a glorious example of when art, music and gameplay coalesce into something far more intoxicating than its sum parts would have you expect.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping this Replay bundle gives <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/patapon-2-remastered-review/">the second game a little more love and attention</a>, though.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Patapon fans might like to revisit the early games, but if you want something actually new, the original creators are working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/16/patapons-legacy-will-continue-when-ratatan-arrives-in-2025/">Ratatan</a>, which is also due out later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-go-live-on-april-2nd-according-to-best-buy.1146735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-2nd-best-buy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A hastily deleted <a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/video-games/nintendo-switch-2-announced-launching-in-2025">blog post</a> by Best Buy Canada has stated that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console will go live on April 2nd 2025, a date that was tipped by various punters a few days ago. Nintendo have not officially announced anything and as the post was removed rather quickly it does suggest that Best Buy announced things a little too early.&nbsp; However, the date is the same as next week’s Switch 2 Direct so put on your surprised face when they announce it during the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>

<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>
<div>
<p>There’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit, </a>though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, the console does not have a release date but we would assume that if they are going to start taking pre-orders, the release date will be announced at the same time.</p>

		<p>Super Rare Originals and developer Pixel Reign have announced Moros Protocol, a retro-styled sci-fi FPS roguelite that will be coming to PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moros Protocol | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/As49-2YisCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Waking up aboard a battleship heading to war, you quickly discover that the ship has been taken over by monsters that have killed pretty much all the crew. With your AI companion Ody-6, you have to try time and again to fight back those beasts and save the ship.</p>
<p>What immediately stands out about the game is the visual style. There’s some common ground with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/29/system-shock-remake-review/">the System Shock remake</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> in that the world is rendered in 3D, but a retro aesthetic is applied by having heavily pixellated textures. Combined with some hefty neon glow and bloom, and it’s an aesthetic that still stands out. It’s built on a custom renderer to really capture the desired look.</p>


<p>As a roguelite that’s inspired by the speed of classic shooters, there’s plenty of weapons in the game, from SMGs and pistols through to swords and flamethrowers, and you’ll often be rewarded by opening chests to get new weapons or find augments to boost your particular playstyle.</p>
<p>Each run will offer you the chance to choose your own path through a branching design, either playing it safe to progress, or risk it for a better upgrade or weapon. After each run ends – by death or otherwise – you can upgrade your abilities more permanently to help on future attempts.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p>Another nice tweak is that you can get a buddy to join you with support for drop-in co-op for two players.<b></b></p>

		<p>ustwo Games has announced that it will be released Monument Valley 3 on PC and consoles this summer, following on from its brief exclusivity on Netflix. The game was released back in December for the streaming service, and now the studio is looking to reach more players as it comes to PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Additionally, the original Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 will be released on April 15th for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monument Valley 3 | Launch Trailer |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a> way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to Flood Relief.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/chucklefish">Chucklefish</a> and co-developer Robotality have revealed their first proper look at their magical life-sim Witchbrook, confirming that the game will be coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox this winter. It will be day one in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass"> Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchbrook - First Look Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will let you enrol in Witchbrook College near the seaside city of Mossport, sinking into a world where you can simply pull out your magic wand and clean up messes and broken plumbing, or hop onto your broomstick and fly over the rooftops. The trailer also showing little snippets of home decoration and fishing. Truth be told, it doesn’t really show too much about what the game will actually play like, though it’s sure to lean on established genre tropes in some areas.</p>
<p>The game is playable with up to four players exploring the sandbox in co-op multipayer, and honestly, the pixelart visual style is stunning. Every scene in the trailer is packed with people and detail from an isometric view.</p>
<p>Technical Director Rodrigo Braz Monteiro said of his the game, “Witchbrook is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on, and it’s been a long time coming, but I’m very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon. I don’t think that the level of simulation and fidelity we’ve aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, producer Rosie Ball explained that the team has embraced a 4-day work week and no-crunch approach to getting the game made, which is always great to hear.</p>
<p>This is the first meaningful look at Witchbrook, but you might remember the game from its original announcements. First teased as Project Spellbound in 2017, with Chucklefish looking to ride the wave of Stardew Valley interest (for which they provided porting support for the console versions), it was then named as Witchbrook a year later in 2018. At that time, the concept artwork and screenshots showed the game with that face-on view familiar to many pixel art life sims. In the intervening time, the game has clearly jumped 45º to give an isometric viewpoint, which feels much more distinct.</p>
