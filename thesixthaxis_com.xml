		<p>Firaxis has released Update 1.1.0 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilzation-7">Civilization 7</a>, the patch bringing the first batch of UI improvements to the game, some AI adjustments and adding a new Natural Wonder to discover.</p>
<p>The update is out now across all platforms, PC and consoles, bringing their versions back into alignment as the console update also incorporates changes from hotfix patches 1, 2, and 3. Cross-play has also now been re-enabled.</p>


<p>In general, Firaxis has sought to address <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/firaxis-highlights-three-areas-theyll-improve-civilization-7-after-mixed-launch-reviews/">some of the main complaints that players of the game have had</a>, with the UI having come in for a lot of stick at launch. This is the first step for UI improvements that will continue with Update 1.1.1 later this month and through to further updates. For this update there’s things like fixing unit tooltips to remain within screen bounds, making scrollbars work when scrolling with a wheel, updates to the Leader Attribute Menu, and lots of other small tweaks to generally try and improve the UI.</p>
<p>There’s also AI improvements, so they’re able to better aim for a Cultural Victory – these have been overhauled for the Modern Age in general – a balance pass on Mementos, and fixes for converting Holy Cities in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p>Free for all players is the new Natural Wonder to discover, the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

<p>Here’s the PC patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.0 – <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">head here for console</a>:</p>
