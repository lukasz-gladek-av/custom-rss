		<p>Marking the tenth anniversary of Goat Simulator’s bizarre goat-laden shenanigans, Coffee Stain North has released a brand new update for Goat Simulator 3, the latest game in the series. This free update is now live, and entitled Gifts from the Rifts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Gifts From The Rifts  | Free Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zba_mk_4KyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s 27 new gear items added in Gifts from the Rifts for Goat Simulator 3, while there’s two new in-game events to bring April Fools silliness to the game world of San Angora.</p>
<p>There’s also a new alternate goat model: Plushie Pilgor, to tie in with a new merch collab with YouTooz. This soft toy goat has a new ability that will turn anything in its path into a plaything as well. That’s quite a feat for Coffee Stain North to have accomplished for this game!</p>

<p>Gifts from the Rifts is available now for Goat Simulator 3 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, PC, iOS and Android. It’s coming soon for the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the Goat Direct stream was filled with other Goatee stuff. There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, there’s <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s the aforementioned <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s just <a href="https://youtu.be/rTV5W0S4qoY">one more thing</a>…</p>

		<p>Rounding off the Goat Direct stream was a teaser for the next paid DLC expansion for Goat Simulator 3. Wherever will Pilgor be going next?</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Expansion 2 | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTV5W0S4qoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having launched back in 2022, Pilgor’s adventures in Goat Simulator 3 continued with the 2024 expansion, Multiverse of Nonsense, with its distinctly out-of-this-world tone. But what’s next? Well, it looks quite a lot like a vast and blank desert from the teaser trailer above, but is that then a tiger or lion growling at our tongue-dropping goat? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a teaser, and I’ve absolutely no doubt that Coffee Stain will have a bigger reveal as we inch closer to its release. But in the meantime, there’s plenty with which to celebrate the tenth anniversary of what started as a dumb meme game.</p>
<p>For Goat Simulator 3 specifically, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/goat-simulator-3-gets-a-big-new-free-update-with-gifts-from-the-rifts-and-a-plushie-goat/">a free new update, Gifts from the Rifts</a>, while iOS and Android players can finally buy and play Multiverse of Nonsense.&nbsp;There’s also <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, a <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s a <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>, which is rather cute.</p>

		<p>A release date has been scheduled for Monster Train 2, a locomotive-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC on 21st May – and if you can’t wait that long, then there’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo available on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Monster Train 2 release date trailer gives us a look at the arriving Titans, who have turned up to try and destroy the world, forcing Heaven and Hell to put their differences aside to survive the new onslaught, and push them all the way back to their home in the Abyss.</p>
<p>Building on the&nbsp;original’s three-floor battle system, you’ll have this new enemy faction to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types. Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">taking place tomorrow, 2nd April at 2PM UK time</a>, and Nintendo has now told us just how long the presentation will be.</p>
<p>It’ll be around 60 minutes, Nintendo states on social media, and you can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 02.04.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1uGRs-ispRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s basically the whole story, but you might think it mildly interesting that Nintendo didn’t choose to use a different unit of measurement. They could, for example, have said it would be 3,600 seconds, got a little bit of fractional love in by saying it would be 1/24th of the day, or gone a little more obscure to tell you that the stream will be 0.00011408% of the whole year of 2025.</p>
<p>“Interestingly”, that’s shorter than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuLci-lSeCo">the PlayStation 5 reveal stream in 2020</a>, which came in at around 70 minutes, but it is six times longer than <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-reveal-launch-date-specs-confirmed/">the PS5 Pro technical address</a>.</p>
<p>I guess saying that it’s 60 minutes is pretty clear and to the point, it just doesn’t help with word counts and search engine rankings.</p>

<p>Alright, enough messing around. There’s an hour of time to fill for the Switch 2 reveal, and plenty of ground for Nintendo to cover properly, after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> arrived back in January. It was a pretty abstract and brief look at the console hardware, showing lots of points of comparison for how the design has changed compared to the original Switch. It showed the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>However, it also hinted quite heavily at a long-rumoured mouse-like mode for the Joy-Con, and there’s a mysterious C-button on the right Joy-Con that everyone remains puzzled by. Expect those to be properly details, alongside some more technical expectations, such as if there’s 4K output and upscaling, <em>how</em> the game will handle <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/nintendo-finally-confirms-switch-2-backward-compatibility/">backward compatibility</a>, and if there’s paid Switch 2 game upgrades.</p>
<p>And once that’s out the way, it will have to be time for the games. From January,&nbsp;the real highlight was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>, and we expect to see a lot more of that during the Nintendo Direct, in addition to seeing some more first party games, and details on pricing and release date.</p>
<p>This is all leading into a string of hands-on preview events around the world through April and May, and we can’t wait to go hands on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>10 Chambers know how to make a multiplayer shooter. The team, built from the ground up by Ulf Anderson, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, spawned from the Payday 1 and Payday 2 team, with their opening studio salvo being the bloody and tough GTFO. If that was the game they ‘had’ to make, Den of Wolves is the game they ‘need’ to make. From our early hands-on session, this is the culmination of everything they’ve previously built, but they’re exploring the genre in some unexpected and intriguing ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Den of Wolves is a techno-thriller, a multiplayer heist, and an Inception-like journey into the human mind. Fundamentally, this is Payday and GTFO by way of Deus Ex, set in 2097 in a future where corporations have built their own superstate in the middle of the Atlantic Sea.</p>


<p>Den of Wolves is set in Midway City. The island of Midway began life as one of Pan-Am Airways’ refuelling spots on its way to cracking travel between the US and Asia, before it became a crucial base for America during World War 2, but in this future, a giant cityscape has overwhelmed the island, spilling into the sea and thrusting into the clouds.</p>
<p>This evocative setting, one that ties the East and the West, plays host to the Corporations. The team describe it as a high-tech Venice, with a stock exchange that sits at the centre of global trade. All Corporations have a presence there, and the island is split into five distinct districts, each controlled by a different company.</p>

<p>Within this setting, cybercrime and industrial espionage are rife. You work for the Corporations, taking jobs from the highest bidder, and in Midway City, loyalty is bought rather than earned. You’re not, as you may have guessed, the hero of this piece; you’re a criminal mastermind, putting together a crew that’s capable of shooting, looting and hacking their way to success.</p>

<p>Each heist is built upon a series of smaller jobs, culminating in the central mission. The prep jobs might see you building up your tech or collecting information, but each acquisition affects how the final act plays out. For our playthrough, we got to play a single prep mission, and the team describe these as being ‘bitesized’ experiences, which will fit into a lunchbreak and let you move forward with the game even when you’re short of time.</p>
<p>Our team of four blasted through this vault theft in just under ten minutes – the fact that we were grouped up with Vlad and Calle of 10 Chambers might have helped us out a bit – but you can opt to extend these prep missions by heading back into the area to try and grab more loot.</p>
<p>There’s serious risk to balance against the reward though, and Vlad and Calle told us that the difficulty seriously ramps up the longer you stick it out, making the chances of success much slimmer. It’s a tantalising challenge, and the ghost of GTFO’s hardcore difficulty level satisfyingly rears its head here. The main run through both the prep and the final mission felt tough but fair, and we had to communicate and work as a team, balancing gunplay while breaking into vaults, reviving fallen comrades or throwing up defensive shields and turrets.</p>

<p>So far, you might be thinking that this is Payday in the future, and while it’s undeniably built on the same foundations, Den of Wolves has a digital ace up its cybernetic sleeve: The Dive. You are one of the few people capable of The Dive, which is an ability to hack neural networks in a way that AI can’t. In gameplay terms, they’ve crossed Inception with Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>The Dive can, fundamentally, be whatever 10 Chambers want it to be. These sections of a heist are separate in terms of their structure, and the way they play is notably distinct from the bombastic gunplay of the central heist. In our playthrough, The Dive saw our team leaping through the mind of a prisoner, jumping between floating platforms as gravity tilted and turned the landscape in disconcerting ways. It was set against a timer as well, where failing to make a jump and the inevitable drop into the abyss was a devastating blow to our team. Thankfully, only one player needs to make it to the end to succeed.</p>
<p>What’s exciting, for both players and the team at 10 Chambers, is that the possibilities here are nearly infinite. Simon spoke animatedly about the idea, saying, “The only thing where it limits us it it needs to be a first-person experience. It’s not going to be a Match-3 or an RTS or a side scroller, but you could be running through a maze hunted by a monster. Right now we’re working on a forest setting where there’s a creature tracking you. We can lean into military simulation or it can be a Japanese temple where you’re fighting ninjas, and what’s interesting is that it’s not just providing variation for the players, but for us developers as well”.</p>

<p>This idea is Den of Wolves’ golden bullet. The freedom and creativity that it allows is unprecedented, and the fact that in the midst of a heist you could suddenly be free-running across city rooftops like Mirrors Edge or battling demons in the ruins of a castle. I wasn’t the first to suggest that we might see a GTFO-like Dive, and the team seemed open to that possibility. Hell, they’re open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>Beyond the heists, the guns and the masks, it’s clear that 10 Chambers want Den of Wolves to be a truly global force. The team have already started on this path, releasing deep dive videos into different aspects of the game’s development, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNroOU2W1C4">motion capture</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpcCbA7jrE0">music</a>, and releasing a music video for Viklund’s stellar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oli2M8Z1EU">Inject</a>.</p>
<p>The iconography, the visual design and the ethos all speak to a team that are creating a brand as much as they’re designing a game. In the modern development sphere, it’s a canny approach, and much like League of Legends, Den of Wolves’s rich, tangible sci-fi world has the potential to capture fans beyond the game’s frantic robberies.</p>
<p>The music is an integral part of that, and Simon, who was the composer for Payday 1, Payday 2 and GTFO, relished the opportunity to craft something fitting for the game’s futuristic settings. He told us, “In part, it’s the arbitrary choice of wanting to do something different, to challenge myself, while at the same time staying in the wider genre of EDM. I chose to go for something slower and heavier, like an unstoppable force type of energy.” He continued, “Hip-hop and rap music has a little bit of that, with the super deep 808 bass sounds and the slower tempo, and I felt that was a good fit – at least for the parts of the mission where everything is going to plan!”</p>

<p>When things go wrong, the audio tempo ticks up, reflecting the sudden overwhelming enemies that are homing in on your position. As your heart rate ramps up, and your teammates start shouting for support, Simon’s tracks take on a completely different tone.</p>
<p>Eye’s glinting, Simon says, “The music here still has the gritty texture and the electronics, but it’s more high-octane. It’s adrenaline-pumping music. I’ve sectioned off a certain part of EDM where I feel I can move around, and we can cover the emotions that we want the players to feel.” From first-hand experience, it definitely works.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves is another statement piece from 10 Chambers, and perhaps more clearly than ever, this is a game that’s about grasping the anonymity of the teams’ signature masks. Where the Payday games gave you the chance to be the villain, Den of Wolves explores some of the darkness that lurks at the edges of everyone’s psyche.</p>
<p>Simon describes this as ‘moral escapism’, the idea that beyond the mechanical freedom of firing a gun in a military shooter, here players can do something wholly illegal, become someone wholly different. It’s less Ocean’s 11, more neo-noir techno thriller , a dark undercurrent running through its narrative threads. Wherever your conscience sits on this moral scale, Den of Wolves brings a new sense of catharsis and freedom to the multiplayer space.</p>
