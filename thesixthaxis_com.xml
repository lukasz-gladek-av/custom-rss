		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launched in just under a month on 21st October, Team Ninja and Platinum Games have shared some new gameplay and talked about some key new difficulty features for the game, including an easier “Hero Mode” that adds gameplay assists.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Difficulty Design | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ccI2SOsD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hero Mode is a nice way of saying Easy Mode, and sits below the Normal difficulty. The main difference is that it adds assists like auto-dodge and auto-guard, so that new players can acclimatise themselves to the ninja action. You can fiddle with these assists at any time in the menus, and switch between Hero, Normal and Hard difficulties through a playthrough, as you need.</p>
<p>Master Ninja difficulty, however, cannot be switched to or from mid-run. This means that it will remain the preserve of the ultra skilful diehards of the franchise.</p>
<p>Thankfully you will still have access to the training mode. This, possibly taking inspiration from fighting games – will let you drop into a training room to practice your attack strings and defensive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, and it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>

		<p>Remasters come sooner every generation, it seems. Gungrave GORE Blood Heat has just been announced, a fully rebuilt version of Gungrave GORE.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gungrave GORE Blood Heat – Announce Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U90lcQ3_aHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blood Heat brings the game to a new engine – Unreal Engine 5 – with enhanced visual quality and modernised systems as well. Which is odd, because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE first launched in 2022</a> and was already on current generation consoles.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the game can’t be improved further. There’s new systems, more refined characters and background visuals, the return of heritage, exclusive new characters and more.</p>
<p>Gungrave GORE Blood Heat is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. Also Game Pass.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2022, we said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE,</a> “Gungrave G.O.R.E is a decent game. It’s not the best shooter, but it is often very entertaining if just for the spectacle. It has a few issues, mostly in level design, and the story isn’t particularly memorable, but there’s plenty of fun to be had in chainsawing your enemies with a transforming coffin.”</p>

		<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft has now officially announced Forza Horizon 6, confirming their own leak with the exact same teaser video.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwlw0ChiSR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is a collaboration between Playground Studios and Turn10, but details are still being kept under wraps with more to show next year. However, the teams did share a few tidbits on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the game will once again feature a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but they’ve also brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism”. Seasons will also make a return, to have as great an impact as they did for Forza Horizon 4’s British seasons, and they’ll naturally be trying to embrace the local car culture of Japan.</p>
<p><em>The original story follows:</em></p>

<p>Just ahead of the Xbox Tokyo Game Show event at 11AM UK time, Forza Horizon 6 has leaked, confirming that &nbsp;the next entry in the open world racer is heading to Japan, when it launches in 2026.</p>

<p>The teaser shows a number of license plates from the locations that the series has visited in the past, before panning past some Japanese memorabilia and up to reveal Mount Fuji off in the distance.</p>
<p>The leak came from Forza’s own social media accounts, posting the teaser to Instagram almost 12 hours ago, and it’s seemingly appearing as an advert across social streams. With the cat out of the bag – the neko, if you will – it seems they’ve just left it all live.</p>
<p>No word on platform specifics just yet, but the game is definitely coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC at launch, with Xbox Play Anywhere and availability on Game Pass. Whether it’s day and date for PS5 as well, we won’t have to wait too long to find out, I suspect.</p>
