		<p>Developer Troglobytes Games and publisher Digital Vortex Entertainment have confirmed that the Lovecraftian inspired survival action game RailGods of Hysterra will be available through Steam Early Access on April 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="RailGods of Hysterra - Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlUQj4xMS3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We at Troglobytes are thrilled to invite all players to get on board the RailGod and wander through the Lovecraftian world we crafted with so much love and passion! See you all in Hysterra, and remember: Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!”</em> said Saverio Caporusso, CEO and Lead Designer at Troglobytes Games.</p>
<p><em>“To fans of cosmic horror, survival games, and those who just love trains, we’re happy to shout ‘ALL ABOARD!’”</em> said Digital Vortex CEO and Co-Founder Alex Izotov. <em>“This is an adventure we’ve been working on for a long time, and your feedback will be instrumental in shaping RailGods of Hysterra into its final form.”</em></p>
<p>In RailGods of Hysterra players can ride the train, which is infused with a RailGod, solo or team up in groups of four as you explore a world in which the Old Gods have conquered. The train can be customised by adding additional cars that can be used as storage facilities and workbenches. As you venture into this nightmare world you will face monsters and cultists that you beat in battle, or capture them to feed to the RailGod. This is a twisted world after all and the RailGod wants something in return for acting as your transport.</p>

<p>After RailGods of Hysterra releases on Steam Early Access it will eventually make its way to PS5, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-will-now-launch-in-october-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has been delayed once again, now set to launch in October 2025 after missing the previous target of a first half 2025 release. However, World of Darkness Executive VP Marco Behrmann states that the game is now complete and into the final bug fixing and polishing phase of development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Game Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rzc1Ow18qhY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the game update video, Behrmann runs through the development progress of the past year or so, which has been covered through dev diaries from developer The Chinese Room. This includes adding more narrative depth, character development and evolving Fabian’s role in the storyline, partly in response to community feedback to earlier announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>In a statement attached to the video, the team say:</p>
<p><em>Hello Kindred,</em></p>

<p><em>We would like to share an update on the development and release window of Vampire: the Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</em></p>
<p><em>As Marco explained in the video, Bloodlines 2 will not be ready for release in the first half of 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date.</em></p>
<p><em>The game is currently in a late development stage, and feedback from the community has been taken into account during this time. TCR is working hard on quality assurance to ensure it is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Bloodlines 2 will launch in October 2025 when the game meets the technical quality standards that you, our fans, rightfully expect and deserve. Please stay tuned for the game’s exact launch date.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to ensure that the content we share with you is high-quality and showcases exciting game features. With this updated release timeline, we will pause our development diaries so that the team can concentrate on refining the game. However, we will still be available online for questions and comments, and we welcome everyone to join the Bloodlines 2 Discord.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has had a very, very long journey through development. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game. Still set in Seattle, there’s a three-way power struggle for power in the Vampire Court, and in an intriguing shift, with protagonist Phyre cast as an Elder Vampire, capable of tapping into all the fantastical enhancements that each clan offers them. First expected for late 2024, release has slipped multiple times.</p>
<p>The big question is whether October 2025 will actually stick. After all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">other developers and publishers are preparing to delay their games</a> from the end of this year to avoid the crushing behemoth that is GTA 6, which is doggedly sticking to a late ’25 launch, according to Take-Two. We’ll see how that affects Bloodlines 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Fortnite x The Walking Dead collab lets you create your own zombie-filled islands]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/new-fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-collab-lets-you-create-your-own-zombie-filled-islands/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-collab-lets-you-create-your-own-zombie-filled-islands.1145043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/new-fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-collab-lets-you-create-your-own-zombie-filled-islands/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Walking Dead is coming back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> in a new and creative way, with a bunch of assets and content from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead Universe</a> added to Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative. This means you’ll be able to drop into the editing tools and quickly cook up a Zombie-filled TWD-themed island of your own.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Walking Dead Universe Lurches into UEFN and Fortnite Creative" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sB3hyiahKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different elements that you’ll be able to draw upon for your creations. It starts with the Walker NPC template for UEFN, a slow and shambling enemy that just wants to chomp on people, giving damage-over-time and eventual death. They can be grouped into hordes and can also smash through breakable environmental props.</p>
<p>This collaboration will also add Negan to Fortnite, both as a playable character for purchase from 4th April, and as an NPC with an update on 8th April. The Shiva Shotgun and Negan’s iconic spiked bat, Lucille, are also available.</p>
<p>JAHBSKD</p>

<p>But you don’t want to just drop these into basic Fortnite levels. The Prison Starter Island Template gives a basic prison layout to then populate and customise, and there’s also eight prison-themed Prefabs that can be placed in worlds. It can all be made to look extra TWD-like with a Heavy Linework shader to get that graphic novel feel.</p>
<p>Alongside all the other tools available in UEFN, you can create whatever kind of experience you want with this. Epic suggest survival RPGs, prison escapes and FFA shoot ’em ups, but I reckon a zombie baseball game would be a good shout.</p>
<p>Any creations can be published from 16th May via the Creator Portal, and can then potentially be found in the TWDU section of Discover, which will be present for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/the-walking-dead-universe-lurches-into-uefn-and-fortnite-creative?team=personal">Head to the announcement blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In other Fortnite-ly news, people that want to relive the early days of Fortnite BR can continue to do so with Fortnite OG, which has now moved on to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-makes-a-lucky-landing-into-season-3">Chapter 1 Season 3</a>. This brings back Lucky Landing and features a meteor on a collision course with the original island.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Event That Started It All - Fortnite OG Season 3 Launches March 25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvuJtEhV4Nc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A bit like rewatching a favourite TV show, we all know what happens next, but it’s nice to revisit, isn’t it? The huge Team Deathmath mode OG 50v50 is also coming back for a limited time, so get into that while you can.</p>
