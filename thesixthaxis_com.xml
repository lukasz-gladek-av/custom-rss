		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed once again after missing its amended release date of October 31st, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-to-october-31st/">been previously pushed back from a September 5th release date.</a> The new release date is December 12th. The reason for the delay this time is due to Reef Entertainment needing to put together the physical editions of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and that will take some effort.</p>

We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey. <wbr>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions, which we need some time to do. <wbr>Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: NO FATE to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
