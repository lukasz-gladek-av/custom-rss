		<p>Sony has announced a big price cut for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a>, dropping the recommended retail price of the of the VR headset starting in March.</p>
<p>The same two SKUs for PSVR 2 will still be on offer – a base edition that includes the PSVR 2 headset, PSVR 2 Sense controllers and some earbuds, and a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle that adds a digital download code for the game – and they will now have the exact same price.</p>


<p>The new RRP for PSVR will be $399.99 (pre-tax) / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty significant drop of $150 / €150 / £130 for the standard set, and $200 / €200 / £170 for the game bundle – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/psvr-2-price-cut-by-a-whopping-200-180-for-a-limited-time/">this matches the promotions from last summer</a>, as they were gearing up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the release of the PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps indicative of where PSVR 2 is as a product. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch have all gone without any price cuts since the start of this generation. In fact, they’ve actually become more expensive over time, even when shrunken down, simplified versions of these consoles have launched,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/"> like with the PS5 Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the PSVR 2 PC adapter last year, dropping the price permanently could spur on some sales, with speculation and insider whispers that Sony has struggled to shift the hardware – there’s also been rumours that Apple might like to co-opt the Sense controllers for Apple Vision Pro compatibility, though these are not sold separately and any plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Sony has noted that recent updates for PSVR 2 have added low-latency hand tracking, which lets you put the controllers down and play using your hands and fingers, the PSVR 2 headset mapping out their positions using the tracking cameras ordinarily used for following the Sense controllers. This is supported with the recently updated Waltz of the Wizard:</p>
<p><iframe title="Waltz of the Wizard - Hand Tracking Update Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXtR7_4IdaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All in all, this could make PSVR 2 a shade more appealing – it not longer quite costs more than a PS5 (with disc drive), for example – and the PC VR support is excellent, opening up broader access to VR gaming and with the reassuring longevity that PC gaming provides.</p>

		<p>Independent developer 4A Games Ukraine has rebranded as Reburn and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/la-quimera-is-a-new-sci-fi-shooter-from-the-metro-devs-and-nicolas-winding-refn/">announced their new sci-fi IP La Quimera</a>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they’ve done this, and how, when 4A Games and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro">Metro</a> series are both owned by Embracer Group. Well, it’s because what has generally been referred to as 4A Games is actually two companies: 4A Games Malta which is owned by Embracer, and 4A Games Ukraine (now Reburn), which is independent.</p>


<p>It makes absolute sense that, now that they are launching a new IP, Reburn needs to stake out a new identity for itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for confusion here, and there is still some fuzzy grey areas in the understanding of the timelines and the financial transactions that took place over the past decade. We’ll seek to clear this up through this article.</p>

<p>In essence, 4A Games was founded in 2006 by a core group of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> developers striking out from GSC Game Worlds. In 2014, with the first wave of the Russian-backed uprisings in Eastern Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, some of the team, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/4a-games-opens-new-malta-studio">including creative director and co-founder Andrew Prokhorov and CTO Oles Shyshkovtsov</a>, left the country and set up a new studio in Malta – 4A Games Malta. Both studios could use the 4A Games trademark, share the 4A Engine, and develop <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> together. In public statements, the Malta studio was referred to as the headquarters for 4A Games, with the Kyiv studio</p>
<p>Where things get muddled is in August 2020. At that time, Embracer (who already held the Metro IP via Koch Media) acquired “4A Games”, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games/">announcing in the press release</a> that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> would be the new parent company for the 150+ members “across two studios in Malta and Ukraine”. Despite the last two years of instability for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a>, “4A Games” and the Metro IP are still held by the company.</p>
<p>However, the timeline according to Reburn is that Embracer only acquired 4A Games Malta in 2020. Separately in the same year, 4A Games Ukraine received additional investment and started work on their new IP La Quimera. At a later date, and to prevent future confusion, they have decided to leave the 4A Games trademark with the Malta-based studio and rebrand as Reburn.</p>
<p>It’s a quietly remarkable story for how unremarkable it actually is, outside of scratching our heads how Embracer didn’t actually acquire the Ukraine studio. There’s no big wave of layoffs, no exodus of developers, and both studios can proudly share their legacy of working on the Metro series. This is perhaps conceptually similar to how Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin created <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/10/08/dishonored-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Dishonored</a> together and then started working on separate projects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, both Reburn and 4A Games will be able to use the 4A Engine. While Reburn has now announced La Quimera, 4A Malta’s next game is still under wraps – the most recent game in the Metro series was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro: Awakening VR</a>, developed and self-published by Vertigo Games, and we know that a new Metro is in the works.</p>

		<p>The Pokémon Day stream gave us a first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, including some huge changes for Pokémon battles and returning fan-favourite features. They’ve also re-confirmed that the game will launch this year for Nintendo Switch with a Late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The “extended” look at the game amounted to a three and a half minute narrated walkthrough of the game’s setting and key features.</p>
<p>it’s set in Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y with Prism Tower at its heart while the urban landscape undergoes a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. Once you reach the city at the start of the game, you’ll be able to choose from Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile as the three starters – pour one out for Cyndaquil fans, as Tepig replaces him in the Gen 2 line-up.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s a new frenemy to be your rival, either Urbain or Taunie, depending on the appearance you choose for yourself in the game. The hotel you stay at is run by AZ and his partner Pokémon Floette, returning from Pokémon X&amp;Y. At the head of the redevelopment plan is Quasartico Inc. and their CEO Jett and her subordinate Vinnie.</p>

<p>Throughout the city are wild zones for Pokémon to thrive, locked off by numbered green gates. Here you’ll use the same style of catching mechanics as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>, just throwing Poké Balls at creatures, and using your Pokémon’s abilities to weaken tougher targets.</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>There’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time. Maybe in April?</p>
