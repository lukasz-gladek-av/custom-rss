			<p>A Nickelodeon dungeons and dragons style mash up sounds very good on paper, drawing on characters from across their many different IP to take up various roles from a tabletop fantasy RPG. That’s what Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does that well, as Timmy from Fairly Oddparents transforms into a wizard and SpongeBob becomes a knight, but outside of the cartoon mashup, this is quite a basic game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPHWEJK_7U0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny, Timmy wishes to be transported into the world of one of his favourite games. However, the wish goes wrong and pulls in characters from other shows, as well as dungeons based upon various Nickelodeon shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and enemies inspired by the shows to boot. Battling through the world renders this as an isometric action RPG, and while you’re probably not expecting genre-beating graphics, what’s odd is that character models look desaturated. Katara looks deathly pale and far from her normal skin tone. This desaturations is mostly noticeable on characters with the levels themselves looking better with more vibrant colours.</p>


<p>Between levels you end up in a hub called The Tangle, filled with shops and side missions. It is also here where you can switch between characters to try out which playstyle is best for you. As mentioned, Timmy is a wizard with range attacks, while SpongeBob is a knight so gets closer in. Other characters fall into the rogue, barbarian and healer roles, which works for multiplayer. In single player, picking one character is better after a little experimentation. I ended up sticking with Timmy due to his range and ability to target multiple enemies.</p>


<p>Each character has special abilities to use too to deal with more powerful enemies and groups of them, but the majority of the time you will be using the same basic attacks which can get repetitive, even if you do switch characters. The game throws weapons, armour, talismans, and consumables at you, so there is always better gear. These can be found in chests, from completing challenges, buying them from the shop, and defeating bosses.</p>
<p>Levels themselves are pretty linear though a few do have some winding paths and one has you working out which portals to use to move forward. These variations are far between, with the majority of levels looking fine and different across worlds, but being samey in playstyle makes things a bit uninteresting. You can tell effort has gone into crafting levels that use the Nickelodeon shows as inspiration, but more could be done.</p>

<p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny’s story is fine and does draw on humour from the various shows it uses, but do not expect anything with depth. This is definitely aimed at a younger audience, so things are easy to follow. It is all voice acted and it is decent, though it could be stronger. There are some performance issues present in the game too, playing the Switch 1 version of the game on Switch 2. Some cutscenes just glitched with frames jumping back and forth, overlaying on each other in a way that hurt to watch. There were also a few times where characters would get stuck while moving around levels.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does have entertainment value to it, especially for a younger audience, but those looking for a nostalgic trip revisiting Nickelodeon characters might be a bit disappointed due to how basic the gameplay and levels are. There are also technical hitches that need to be addressed.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s MMORPG update season, and Metin2, Gameforge’s long-running free-to-play entry in the genre, looks set to receive its latest update next month, with the Tyranny of Aamon arriving this November. In the run-up to its release, though, the game will be running a month-long pre-event phase to get players prepped and ready for the host of new features this new update will bring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metin2: Tyranny of Aamon - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IR0akUawX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer, may just be the most teasing of teaser trailers I’ve seen for a while, and other than some moody visuals and a disturbing laugh, there’s not all that much to go on. There definitely will be a dark new region, weeks of in-game events, Twitch Drops, and exclusive giveaways — including gaming PCs worth €2,400 so that seems well worth checking out.</p>
<p>The free expansion will introduce the mysterious Moonshadow Vale — a new region filled with dangerous dungeons, powerful bosses, and unique gear to craft.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release, players can take part in a month-long pre-event phase starting October 8, 2025, featuring exclusive missions, community activities, Twitch Drops, and massive prize raffles with rewards ranging from valuable in-game items to premium merchandise — and even two state-of-the-art gaming PCs valued at €2,400 each. Visit the Tyranny of Aamon promo page for more information.</p>

<p>“For almost two decades, Metin2 has inspired millions of players worldwide. With Tyranny of Aamon, we are opening a new chapter that challenges long-standing veterans while also making it easier for new players to join. This update exemplifies our philosophy of continuously evolving established games while also introducing fresh challenges along with new content,” said Patrick Mathieu, Senior Product Manager at Gameforge.</p>
<p>Highlights of Tyranny of Aamon will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moonshadow Vale as a new zone – A mysterious landscape full of dangers and diverse quests.</li>
<li>Dark dungeons &amp; fearsome foes – The sinister Aamon serves as the central antagonist, but many other dangerous creatures lurk within the new dungeons.</li>
<li>New items – Weapons, boots, and other valuable rewards await victorious heroes.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Nobody really wants to see games delayed, especially when you’re looking forward to them, but equally, no one wants to play something that isn’t quite at its best. The development team for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, have made that difficult decision, though seemingly not to spend more time tweaking and improving (though I’m sure they are) but rather to avoid the holidy release melee that we’re currently in the midst of. Moonlight 2: The Endless Vault’s new release date will be November 19th, where it will launch into Early Access on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Behind the Counter Ep.3 - The Art of Moonlighter 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3GCa-ZiTv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is coming from Digital Sun and 11-Bit Games, and is the direct sequel to the original Moonlighter, a game that mixed some lovely shopkeeping mechanics by day with a little moonlighting as a hero spelunking through dungeons at night. It stands as one of the absolute best indie games of recent years, so we can totally forgive the team for holding onto the sequel for just a little longer, particularly so it can breathe a little easier with fewer big releases around it.</p>
<p>The team at Digital Sun released a statement, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While our original plan was set for October 23, the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’ve decided to&nbsp;<strong>move our release to November 19</strong>.</p>

<p>While we understand extending the wait isn’t the best news, we have a small treat for you! We plan to run Closed Playtests on Steam and via the Microsoft Store, allowing you to test some of the changes we have implemented in the game based on your feedback.&nbsp; You can expect more details on that very soon!</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Consider it a little extra time to sharpen your swords, restock your shelves, and prepare for the adventures ahead.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Publisher 11-Bit Studios may have contributed in some part to the delay themselves, with the console release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> recently hitting shelves, and proving to be the perfect timesink while players wait for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault to arrive.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/raven2-netmarbles-new-open-world-mmo-will-launch-later-this-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/raven2-%E2%80%93-netmarble%E2%80%99s-new-open-world-mmo-will-launch-later-this-month.1314424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are few larger time sinks than an MMO. That’s eased somewhat by being able to play on your mobile and your PC, and Netmarble will be hoping to steal plenty of players’ time with Raven2, their latest cross-platform MMO, when it launches later this month on the 22nd of October.</p>
<p><iframe title="[RAVEN2] RELEASE DATE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqoymgYC96M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, what’s Raven2 all about? This medieval fantasy looks to have some seriously slick hack and slash action, with the speed tuned to just the right side of frantic, and players will be able to choose from eight different classes, each of which offer unique playstyles and customisation. One of the most interesting things though has to be the massive, unified battlefields, and though we’ll have to see how those play out, the trailer gives an interesting impression of how players will either work together or against each other as they attempt to hack their way to glory.</p>
<p>The global version of Raven2 will support 150 countries and 16 languages, including English, Thai, German, French, Indonesian, Malay, and more. Its service will be divided into three major regions: North America, Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania, and Europe. Each region will host 2 Worlds, each containing 12 servers, enabling players to freely select any server within their region.</p>
<p>To honor the launch, Raven2 has prepared a special launch event. Players can earn Crystals by leveling up, and the top 100 players per server will compete for one million Crystals. Additionally, a special tax fund of one million Crystals will be pre-deposited in each server’s Market, and players can claim it by participating in guild activity. The full version of “Dev’s Message” video is available on Raven2’s official YouTube, Facebook, Discord, and on the Epic Games YouTube channel, giving players a closer look at what to expect at launch.</p>


<p>Players can pre-register on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=raven2&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raven2/id6448719154">App Store</a>, or wishlist the game on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/raven2-2c3f27">Epic Games Store</a>. Pre-registered players will receive exclusive rewards including a heroic grade Holy Garment and a special package at the game’s official launch.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine, Raven2 definitely looks the part, brining with it a vast universe set in a dark fantasy realm where players become a member of the Special Corps bearing the “Cursed Stigma.” As you investigate strange and perilous phenomena unfolding across the world, you’ll embark on a journey to vanquish demons and uncover the secrets behind the world’s fate. If this all sounds good to you, make sure you register ahead of the game’s launch on the 22nd of October.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-will-be-out-next-week-bringing-daredevil-and-cross-progression-with-it/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marvel Rivals has managed to maintain a good amount of momentum through its first year, and that’s set to continue with Netease announcing that Season 4.5: Heart of the Dragon, the midway point for the mainline season, will release next Friday, October 10th. The headline additions are always characters, and this time is no different, bringing the iconic Daredevil to the roster, alongside the Man With No Fear’s melee combat-heavy moveset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is definitely a slightly different take on the character than the Matt Murdock we’ve seen embodied by Charlie Cox on Netflix and Disney, with the Marvel Rivals’ version sounding much gruffer and tougher. Visually, his armourset has clear Eastern influence, with Samurai-esque pauldrons on each shoulder, though I’d expect his more traditional look to pop up as part of the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Daredevil fits into the Duelist class, and his radar sense makes all evil visible; nothing escapes his “sight.” In combat, he can pick a priority target based on the situation, use his agility to close the gap, and unleash rapid attacks with his Billy Clubs. When facing tough opponents, Daredevil taps into The Beast’s power, amplifying his martial arts for even more deadly strikes! Activate his Ultimate Ability, and Daredevil fully unleashes The Beast. Any enemy who dares look at him will be gripped by fear, awaiting his cold justice!</p>
<p>If you have Disney+, you can also unlock a complimentary Disney+ inspired Daredevil costume, offered exclusively for a limited time from October 10, 2025 to January 8, 2026. You can learn more about this at <a href="http://disneyplus.com/perks">disneyplus.com/perks</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside Daredevil, the biggest change to the game is the much-needed addition of cross-progression. That means that no matter where you play, you can carry on working on the same characters and season pass. That said, it’s only going to be open to a small number of players through 4.5 as this feature is tested, with the expectation that cross-progression will unlock for all players alongside Season 5.0. Rank and leaderboard progression will stay separate for each platform, which I suppose will ease any questions of those keyboard and mouse players butting up against console controllers.</p>

<p>Finally, this update also brings another round of Team-Up Ability adjustments such as removing Ragnarok Rebirth (Hela – Thor) and taking Namor out of Gamma Charge (Hulk – Namor/Black Panther). Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor). Next, there will be a special Halloween event and themed costumes so players can celebrate this mysterious and lively season together, and there’s also a mystery new mode coming, which we’ll have to wait until the 17th of October to find out more about.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/01/__trashed-7__trashed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-fortnite-crew-and-a-ridiculous-price-increase.1314226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a major shakeup of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, bringing more games to players across its four versions, including the addition of Ubisoft+ to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but with the top tier getting a staggering, frankly ridiculous 50% price increase because of this.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has long been the go-to tier for Game Pass, giving access to a library of games, Day One access to a bunch of new releases (including all first party games), cloud game streaming, and online console multiplayer. Now, Microsoft is guaranteeing at least 75 day one games will be added each year, and the addition of Ubisoft+ Classic and Fortnite Crew.</p>



<p>The price of Game Pass Ultimate has crept up in the last few years, and has stood at $19.99 and £14.99 per month since last summer. Now, though, the price is going up by 50% to $29.99 and £22.99 per month.</p>
<p>That’s justified by the Fortnite Crew addition, which is valued at $12 a month as it gives you the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1000 V Bucks each month, and the Ubisoft+ Classics library, which is valued at $8 per month. It’s starting to sound a bit like cable TV or Sky Sports, where you pay through the nose for a huge package of channels, even if you only really want the one thing.</p>

<p>This now puts a massive premium on Game Pass Ultimate and, while there’s additions and more promises, it feels like Microsoft is readjusting the business model in a way to compensate for “lost” revenue from first party game sales. If you see no value from Fortnite Crew or Ubisoft+, then this is just a huge price increase.</p>
<p>The other way to get day one games, in a more limited fashion, is with PC Game Pass. This is only usable with Windows PC – and with the upcoming Ally X handheld – and is going up from $11.99 / £9.99 to $16.49 &nbsp;/ £13.49. The only change here is the addition of Ubisoft+, getting it for $4.50 / £3.50.</p>
<p>Game Pass Standard has now been rebranded as Game Pass Premium, thankfully holding onto the same $14.99 / £10.99 price point. This is actually just becoming a better deal, as while you don’t have day one games, you will get Xbox published games added within a year of launch, and there is now priority cloud gaming for the Game Pass Premium library and for select games that you own.</p>
<p>The runt of the litter remains Game Pass Essential, which replaced Xbox Live Gold a good while ago. Sticking with $9.99 / £6.99 per month (and I believe still with a 12 month purchase possible) this is required for online gaming, and includes a much smaller selection of games. That’s been doubled now, from 25+ to 50+ games, and you can now access cloud gaming.</p>
<p>All of this comes down to how you use Game Pass to consume games. Do you like the additions to Game Pass Ultimate, or would you be reconsidering your subscription at this price point?</p>
