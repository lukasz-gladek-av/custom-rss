		<p>Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026,” the team wrote on a certain <a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">social media hellscape</a>. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”</p>


<p>The Amy Hennig-led superhero game was announced back in March of last year, having originally been teased in 2021. Plaion had been partnered with as the game’s publisher, and 2025 was the stated launch target, but we’ve had nothing since the cinematic reveal trailer last summer. We could get a gameplay reveal this summer, but it did feel like details were thin on the ground for a game expected this year.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s much better to take your time, get things right and try to release the best game possible… but depending on how big of a delay this ends up being, Skydance do risk slipping back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">that GTA 6 window</a>, which itself has just been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>

<p>The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Today app has revealed more of the small features that are featured in the Nintendo Switch 2, little technical quality of life tweaks that will hopefully make the system a better one for the long haul.</p>
<p>For those keen to keep their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> private, a PIN code lock will be available within the regular system settings, so you can set a code and keep pesky siblings, children, spouses and public transport thieves locked out from&nbsp;<em>your</em> games – obviously the last one would suck so much more if it happened to you than other people in your life just messing with your games.</p>


<p>The original Nintendo Switch also had a PIN code lock feature, though this was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Change-the-Parental-Controls-PIN-1494765.html">tied in with the parental controls</a>, and much less obvious for most users.</p>
<p>Another good feature for those who fuss and fret over battery capacity of their precious smart phones and laptops is the battery saver mode, which lets you tell the Nintendo Switch 2 to stop charging at 90%. This is good for those who tend to keep their consoles docked and rarely play handheld, where having a battery-powered device constantly connected and at 100% can negatively impact capacity – the data on this is a bit fuzzy for if it will help in day-to-day handheld use, though.</p>

<p>And finally, with the Joy-Con 2 able to switch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> at the twist of a wrist, the Switch 2 Home screen and all the system settings and menus can be navigated with a mouse pointer. A small thing, but kinda neat?</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a few weeks away from release on 5th June 2025, coming alongside Mario Kart World, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a pair of Zelda Switch 2 Edition titles</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/all-the-confirmed-nintendo-switch-2-launch-titles/">a plethora of old, new and enhanced third party games</a>, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization 7 and more. Of course, you also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">a huge back catalogue of compatible Nintendo Switch titles</a> that you can still dive back into.</p>
