		<p>Nintendo has released the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/">technical specifications for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, putting all the important stats and details into a nice table for you to refer to, and also revealing their all-important estimates for the new console’s battery life.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get up to 6.5 hours of gameplay out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its 5220mAh battery. The bad news is that when it’s pushed to its limits, you’ll get just 2 hours of play before needing to recharge. That’s potentially shorter than even the first revision of the Nintendo Switch.</p>


<p>That compares poorly to the current line up of Nintendo Switch consoles, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">OLED</a> and the “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/17/nintendo-new-switch-model-battery/">Better Battery Life</a>” models of the Switch 1 both able to game for 4.5 – 9 hours – they quote 5.5 hours for Breath of the Wild. It’s a closer run thing to the original Switch model, though, which was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/01/nintendo-switch-review/">quoted for around 2.5 – 6 hours of play</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s not that dissimilar to <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech/">the original LCD Steam Deck</a>, which had a 2-8 hour battery life window.</p>
<p>So why the big drop in battery life? Chances are it’s mostly down to the screen. The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a larger 7.9″ LCD screen, which will require more power to run than the older consoles, and that’s before you consider that it’s capable of playing at 120Hz and HDR. Combine that with a more powerful Nvidia chipset that needs to push for 1080p instead of 720p, and you’ve got a recipe for shorter game times.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what kinds of game options are made available to players. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, for example, will have a 1080p 120Hz mode, but turning that down to 60Hz could help play the game for an extra hour, perhaps.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the tech specs, we get confirmation of the various details from the Nintendo Direct. The Switch 2 is larger, and a bit heavier than the original Switch. It comes with 256GB of internal storage, expandable with the new MicroSD Express card format – it will not play games from old MicroSD cards – it has two USB-C ports at top and bottom for power and accessories, and the built-in microphone is enhanced with noise cancelling. There’s now WiFi 6 built in, and there’s still support for ethernet via the dock.</p>
<p>The screen is a 1080p 120Hz HDR10 capable display, but when docked the maximum output to a TV is 4K at 60fps. 120fps is supported when playing at either 1080p or 1440p.</p>

		<p>Odin: Valhalla Rising will be getting its global launch on April 29th for PC, iOS, and Android, Kakao Games has confirmed. Pre-loads for Odin: Valhalla Rising will start on April 28th and character name reservations will open alongside the game pre-registrations which start from April 3rd. Those who do pr-register will get a limited edition Viking-themed avatar and mount as well as other rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ODIN:VALHALLA RISING] Pre-registration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4HWmC4quRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Odin: Valhalla Rising, players will be able to explore various realms based upon Norse mythology including Midgaard and Jotunheim as one of four classes. Those classes are Warrior, Sorceress, Priest, and Rogue. Game modes include the 30v30 Valhalla mode, co-op battles, dungeons, and raids. Kakao Games will be adding features further down the line, including a Guild Wars mode. The story of Odin: Valhalla Rising is based upon Ragnarok, with Odin trying to avoid it. He does this by exiling Loki, who doesn’t take this well so awakens different creatures that have been laying dormant in the void of Ginnungagap.</p>
