		<p>The creator of My Friend Pedro has declared his next mission: to blast his way into Hell and arrest Satan. Yup, that’s the plot for the newly revealed ballistic platformer Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital and by DeadToast Entertainment, Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch later this year, but what would you know? It’s Steam Next Fest, so t<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">here’s a demo now available for PC</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After the balletic combat of My Friend Pedro, solo developer DeadToast has leant into the use of multiple firearms to get through levels. Shotgun Cop Man casts players as the titular lead-slinging cop, heading right down into Hell with the mission to arrest the dark lord armed with nothing bu a shotgun in one hand and a pistol in the other.</p>
<p>These ludicrously overpowered firearms are more than strong enough to propel Shotgun Cop Man through the levels, launching and bouncing him up and over obstacles, acting like Flappy Bird’s wings… but more murdery.</p>

<p>The game will feature feature a hand-crafted campaign, while hardcore fans will enjoy that each level has No Damage and Speedrun achievements to chase after. There will be support for user-generated levels as well.</p>
<p>The demo is out now on Steam featuring 17 levels from the full game.</p>
<p>We loved DeadToast’s last outing with My Friend Pedro. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">our review</a> of that sensationalist side-scrolling shooter, Nick said, “If you’ve seen John Wick before, you’ll see Keanu killing about ten villains in mere seconds without breaking a sweat and with insane precision. My Friend Pedro gives you a pretty good idea of what it’s like to be Mr Wick, with time slowing down to a crawl, giving you ample time to shoot everyone in the room. Even better, whenever you kill an enemy, the slow time bar replenishes, enabling you to pull off even more crazy stunts.”</p>

		<p>Steam Next Fest has been bubbling up behind the scenes all week, with so many game demos and announcements coming that I’m not even really sure when it’s starting. Some demos are out now, others are being run over the weekend, more are only coming out on Monday… but it means that if you have a PC and want to see what’s coming soon, you’ve got plenty to see and play this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of that, Dom and I played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/">RoadCraft</a>, a disaster recovery spin-off to the MudRunner series that really makes you feel like a kid in a sandpit. Add to that a game that would be Indiana Jones’ favourite management sim, and that’s my week of games.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> ramping up his gaming again, since his return from the other side of the planet. He enjoyed his time with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/">Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog</a>, a sci-fi visual novel, but this weekend has Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii booked in for review.</p>
<p>The love hate relationship with Alan Wake 2 has continued for <strong>Jim</strong>, who hit a roadblock with The Lake House DLC – “It solidified my opinion that while great at piecing together weird and compelling stories, Remedy doesn’t know how to pair this with interesting gameplay. It’s a shame as the final DLC is arguably the creepiest, zaniest part of the AW2 package – I just felt burned out after already putting some twenty something hours into the base game. I’ve now moved onto A Plague Tale: Innocence, hoping to wedge in a playthrough before Monster Hunter Wilds launches.”</p>


<p>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope would score highly on a password complexity checker, and it scores highly in <strong>Ade’s</strong> finely tuned “good game” checker as well – “It’s a brilliant TBS game, accessible, fun, and perfect for a quick half hour of gaming.” He’s also had some fun times blast giant bugs in the cities of Helldivers 2 this week.</p>
<p>Bemoaning the difficulty of trawling the PlayStation Store sales of full game gems – all the DLC listings just clutter up the joint, don’t they? – <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a broad spread of games to play this week, including the Tomb Raider 4-6 remakes, Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and Palworld. But he also did the important thing and grabbed a month of Game Pass in order to play Avowed… and about 15 other games on there that he was curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played “the forbidden game” of trying to do his marking and being a dad taxi to his kids. In video games, he finished off Gears 5 and got through most of Hivebusters DLC, but found the game endings have sort of petered out and left too many threads dangling. So he moved on to play Eternal Strands, which has been enjoyable, and is checking out a bunch of demos from Steam Next Fest, with a good few write ups to come.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, as always, been playing Destiny 2.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>
