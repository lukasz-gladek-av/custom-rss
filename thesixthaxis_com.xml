			<p>If you’ve been paying attention, there’s a battle being played out in the audio space for control over your ears. Stalwart companies like Sony and Bose continue to create the technological heavy hitters, but while they’ve been winning here for years, there’s been a steady improvement in their competition, and particularly in the value category. Manufacturers like SoundMagic and OneOdio are bringing the fight to them, shrinking the differences between the established firms’ output, while maximising the price difference. It’s a hell of a war, and with the OneOdio A5, they’re firing off another salvo.</p>
<p>The OneOdio A5 are ‘reminiscent’ of Sony’s category-defining XM5s. That is to say, to the casual observer you might mistake one for the other. Ostensibly the shape of the earcups, the headband, and the metal connection between the two, are closely modelled on Sony’s headset, and when the XM5s are arguably the best headphones of this generation, it’s a smart move, if thoroughly unimaginative. I’d have preferred them to offer something truly their own, but I understand the decision.</p>
<p>Where they differ is in the controls, with the A5’s opting for physical buttons rather than the touch and gesture controls of its inspiration. The right earpiece plays host to a volume rocker, power button, Active Noise Cancellation toggle and the USB-C socket for charging. Unlike other options in this category, there’s no 3.5mm connection for wired use, and that’s something of a disappointment, though clearly it’s been done as a marginal cost-saving exercise.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in the powder blue colourway, though it’s also available in a subdued black or off-white option. They definitely look more expensive than their £58 price tag would suggest, and they feel solid and well built in your hands, helped somewhat by the metal joints and smooth plastic on the outside of the sturdy headband. The OneOdio logo sits proudly at the centre of each earpiece, surrounded, in keeping with their design language, by a series of closely packed circular grooves. The downside is that dirt and fluff can build up in them, but a wipe with a cloth soon sets things right again.</p>

<p>You might be surprised by the way the headband extends though, and rather than stretching from the metal joints at the end of the headband, they extend out from a third of the way up each side of the headband, creating an ugly gap on each side if you need to extend them to fit your head. It’s the first true sign of the A5’s cheaper build and design, and it’s a shame when it looks so good elsewhere.</p>
<p>The passive noise cancellation of the OneOdio A5 is very good, reducing external sounds from around the house without having any additional help – a good start for the Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation which is rated for 45db, and can use AI to automatically adjust to your surroundings. In use, I didn’t discern whether the headphones were altering the level of reduction dynamically, but with ANC enabled the A5 does a decent enough job of cutting you off from the world around you, even if a long way away from what you’ll find in Sony’s or Bose’s top-tier offerings.</p>
<p>The audio response itself is very bass heavy. So bass heavy that my graphic equalizer needs a giant peak in the higher frequencies to correct it. Depending on the types of music that you listen to, it might not be quite such a big deal, and it’s certainly enveloping and powerful. Without EQ tweaking, it’s muddy and overpowering, with none of the detail you’d hope or expect from a headset that’s rated for Hi-Res Audio and supports and LDAC connection. That’s amplified if you’re connected to an Apple product, where the best codec you’re getting is AAC, or the Nintendo Switch which has no extra audio controls.</p>

<p>Listening to Mastodon’s Steambreather, the chugging guitars rumbled with enjoyable intent, but the vocals became lost in the mix, an issue that was only slightly remedied by further tweaks of the EQ. Things were dealt with better when listening to the soundtrack for Arcane’s Season 2, and tracks like Marcus King’s Sucker and Raja Kumari and Stefflon Don’s Renegade seemed perfectly designed for the extra bass, thumping along with plenty of energy. They feel perfect for the gym, or cutting out some serious external noise, but if you’re looking for nuance you’re better off looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>You find that the budget pricing seeps into the A5’s features the more time you spend with them, from the lack of auto-off when you take them off your head, to finding the controls for moving tracks backwards or forwards and Play/Pause mean that the power button and volume rocker are drawing double duty. From there, you’ll notice that the ambient mode is distinctly lacking, barely allowing the outside world in, and ultimately meaning that you’ll be better served by taking them off your head if you’re wanting to talk or listen for instructions.</p>
<p>What isn’t cheap is the A5’s battery, and there’s some serious longevity here, with a 45 hour life span with ANC on, and 75 hours without. That has definitely played out during my time with them, and I’ve barely had to charge them in the past month of use. When you do need to charge them in a rush, 10 minutes will get you 10 whole hours of use, and if you’re looking for a headset that’s going to last you days at a time, the A5 is a great pick.</p>
<p>The major competitor here is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/09/monoprice-bt-600anc-headset-review/">Monoprice BT-600ANC</a>. While that is styled after Sony’s older XM4, you get a hard case and the audio they offer is far more balanced than the OneOdio A5s, albeit without the more modern looks. If you’re after comfort though, it’s worth considering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/07/final-ux2000-headset-review/">Final UX2000</a> as well, which again, looks similar to the XM4 while also boasting plenty of low-end depth.</p>

			<p>Have you ever wanted to run a restaurant? How about fighting weird monsters from an isometric perspective with food-themed weapons, like giant meat tenderisers? What if you could combine these two things by feeding the pieces of the monsters you’ve killed to your restaurant customers? Well, don’t be too shocked, but that’s exactly what Cuisineer is! The game begins with you, Pom, who appears to be a catgirl, returning to your hometown of Paell and finding the family restaurant in a state of disrepair. Her parents have gone away, racking up a debt in the process that someone needs to pay. Obviously, as is typical in debt-em-ups as I am now calling them, you’re the person that has to pay this off and you’re going to do it using oversized spatulas and your parents disused restaurant.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cuisineer | Console Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBKSdSFD-Bs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cuisineer gives a very strong first impression. It’s bright, colourful and well animated, and it feels great to play. The combat in particular is incredibly punchy, you can feel the impact of your weapons and it’s very responsive and quick. Running the restaurant is also a strange delight,&nbsp;as always in games like this. There’s just something about dashing around preparing dishes, taking payments, and occasionally stopping a dine and dasher that’s just inherently enjoyable.</p>


<p>The problem is that it is repetitive to the extreme.</p>
<p>Let’s start with combat. After that first run and getting a feel for how the fighting works, my second was immediately felt too familiar with its environments. I’m obviously starting off in the same zone so I expect the theming to be similar, but I was fighting through map tiles that I’d been through on my first run. I suppose I expected a much wider variety of tiles or more granular procedural generation, but every run thereafter I encountered the same again and again. It got incredibly same-y very quickly – even the enemies are usually in the same place and of the same type as last time.</p>


<p>The restaurant has a similar, but more pronounced issue. Whilst it is, much like the combat, enjoyable at first, it quickly gets dull due to how repetitive it is. You begin with a single pot to boil things in, preparing food to order for you while you wait for a timer to tick down, before you rush to take it to the customer (or for them to collect if you can’t be bothered). You can’t queue anything up until you upgrade it, which will also unlock higher tier recipes, but the experience of using it is always the same menu and timer. All the other kitchen workstations work in exactly the same way, so it soon loses its lustre and just feels like busy work.</p>
<p>The restaurant gameplay just never evolves as you would expect it to. With some additions, like staff to help in the restaurant, or something beyond just basic menu use for the cooking, with more variety in the wilderness, this game could be phenomenal. I love this kind of game where combat and management feed into one another, but while Cuisineer gets the basics very right, it doesn’t have enough depth to keep you going.</p>

<p>The stuff in between the restauranting and adventuring is also, unsurprisingly, very repetitive. You earn new recipes by completing side quests, which are almost always invariably bringing a person in the town a suspiciously large amount of something. 15 pieces of wood to make a painting, 25 of the rarest ingredient I’ve found so far, 10 of a specific dish that I have to cook myself, with a limited queue on the workstation that does it so I have to stand there staring at a menu whilst a bar fills up.</p>
<p>Upgrading your restaurant is slow and painstaking, with you investing large amounts of money and resources to unlock a handful of extra floor tiles for the first five upgrades. Your fridge also needs upgrading, as does your storage for wood and stone and so on, using the same resources. Wood, stone, orichalcum, and such all drop from rocks and trees that you can break whilst fighting, so you sometimes spend just as much time rushing around breaking trees and rocks as you do fighting the enemies.</p>
<p>The loot system is very limited as well, I haven’t found a new item for hours and the last one I did find – salt and pepper shakers – happened to handle exactly like the blue crystal boxing gloves I was already using. Each weapon has its own special power, but they sometimes leave you exposed whilst they activate and deal less damage than if you’d just attacked normally, so outside of a few that move you forward or attack from range I mostly ignored them. The affixes that items have seemed promising at first as well, with one or two that changed behaviours quite significantly, like leaving a puddle of ice when I dash that freezes enemies, but again they quickly became very same-y and once I’d started upgrading my equipment I didn’t want to switch to another and invest the cash to upgrade it.</p>

<p>Then as you head into the town of Paell, sometimes shops are closed so you can’t use them and everyone overshares the moment you speak to them. Despite how nice it looks, I found myself dreading having to venture into the town to find a specific side quest giver and deliver whatever disproportionate amount of food items they wanted, because there’s just so many that I could never remember which specific one it was. Every time I had just run between all of them and hope I found it sooner rather than later. It doesn’t help that sometimes they’re not even there, either.</p>
