		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games for December 2025, and it’s a&nbsp;<em>big</em> month with a bumper crop of five games that includes one of their big first party games… in Lego form. There’s also a surprising amount of mutliplayer horror stuff for the festive season.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is the biggest deal here, as Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo’s Lego reimagining of their post-apocalyptic robo adventure. Play as Aloy and chums in a bricky adventure that does things a little bit differently to the Travellers Tales games, but looks absolutely gorgeous.</p>


<p>Then there’s the gruesome twosome of Killing Floor 3’s co-op sci-fi zombie blasting and The Outlast Trials’ co-op horror. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3’s</a> a rather recent game, but didn’t have the greatest launch behind it, while The Outlast Trials has a solid cachet and recently was updated with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/the-outlast-trials-pvp-invasion-mode-is-out-now-just-in-time-for-halloween/">a new versus mode</a>.</p>

<p>With extraction shooters the talk of the town right now, thanks to ARC Raiders, it’s good to remember that there’s plenty of other examples out there too. Synduality Echo of Ada is just one such game, stuffed with cool mechs, customisable characters and tight combat, and putting its own polish on the extraction experience. We gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-the-ultimate-extraction-experience/">a hefty 9/10</a> in our review.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NEON WHITE | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0b-qZTF0Mc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the cream of the crop is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/"><strong>Neon White</strong></a>, which Miguel absolutely adored. He said, “Neon White is a love letter to turn-of-the-decade internet weirdos. It’s full of rule-of-cool anime nostalgia, ear-shredding electronic music, and dialogue ripped straight out of my group chats. It’s a genuine game made for an audience rarely prioritised, but even if you don’t fit the archetypical person this game was made for, you’re still in for the most stylish and satisfying action-platformer I’ve ever experienced.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the November 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
