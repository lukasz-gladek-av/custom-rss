		<p>Nintendo has released its financial report for the financial year 2025, and it has some interesting stats. What we know is that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed 152 million units sold, making it second to the Nintendo DS which had over 154 million units sold. When it comes to the Switch 2, Nintendo is forecasting 15 million hardware sales in financial year 2026, which runs from April 1st 2025 to March 31st 2026. On top of that, Nintendo expects 45 million software sales for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>As you would expect, after the Switch 2 launch Nintendo does forecast a drop in sales for the Switch for financial year 2026. The company expects the hardware sales numbers to shrink by 58.3% compared to financial year 2025, to a total of 4.5 million. That would leave the Switch on course to hit 156 million units sold, which would make it the best selling Nintendo console ever. Nintendo also expects a drop in software sales for the Switch by 32.4% to 105 million units from 155.41 million units. The drops in both of these have been forecast to be made up by the Switch 2 hardware and software sales.</p>
<p>Speaking of software, Nintendo confirmed that 24 titles sold over a million copies in financial year 2025, with 15 being first party titles and 9 being third party titles. Of the new titles, Super Mario Party Jamboree hit 7 million sales, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 3.7 million sales, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door 1.9 million sales, both Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD hit 1.6 million sales, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD hit a million sales. For Switch software lifetime sales, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leads the pack with 68.2 million sales, followed in second place by Animal Crossing: New Horizons at 47.82 million sales, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate in third with 36.24 million sales. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has reached 32.81 million sales on Switch, while follow up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is at 21.73 million. Pokémon Scarlet/<br>
Pokémon Violet has hit 26.79 million, just beating Pokémon Sword/Pokémon Shield which came in at 26.72 million sales.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 release date is set for June 5th 2025</a>, so only a month away. Pre-order stock is currently sold out everywhere at the moment.</p>
