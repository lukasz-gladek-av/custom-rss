		<p>11 bit studios has announced that its clone-filled survival strategy game The Alters will be releasing on June 13th. It will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.

<p>In The Alters there are dangers outside the ship, some of which are invisible, across the various biomes. These can as weird as floating rocks to scenarios that can deal instant death by disintegrating the suit, and other scenarios could see time and space distortions. Night time is even more dangerous due to radiation levels increasing.</p>
<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>
