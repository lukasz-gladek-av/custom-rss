		<p>The alleged last expansion pack for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-sims-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sims 4 </a>has leaked thanks to the ever-reliable South Korean ratings board. The pack is titled Royalty &amp; Legacy, and the brief description states that “The 21st expansion pack for The Sims 4 allows players to become nobles and build a long-lasting dynasty.”</p>
<p>The pack is rumoured to launch in February 2026 and may well be the last ever expansion for The Sims 4 as EA focus on their new Sims game, The Sims Project X.</p>


<p>The Sims Project X is said to be a standalone game but EA are also working on The Sims Project Rene, a multiplayer instalment.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 has been a long-running hit for EA and developer Maxis, launching in September 2014 on PC and subsequently ported to mobile, Mac, and consoles. The game went free-to-play in October 2022 and has gained over 85 million players in its lifetime, with over 30 million of those added since it went free-to-play.</p>
<p>The most recent pack, Adventure Awaits, introduced the Getaway Planner, a system that lets Sims schedule and customise trips and holidays, and also expanded the childhood gameplay.</p>

<p>The Sims are also<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/a-the-sims-movie-is-in-the-works-with-margot-robbies-production-company/"> headed to the cinema</a> with Electronic Arts partnering with LuckyChap – the production company of Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerly, Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr – and Roy Lee and Miri Yoon of Vertigo Entertainment to make it happen.</p>
<p>Kate Herron, who’s best known for directing season one of Loki, is set to tackle the transformation from computer to big screen, and she will be co-writing the screenplay with Briony Redman.</p>
<p>What’s pretty likely is that The Sims will end up following a similar template to Barbie and The Lego Movie that went before, bending the game/toy world in a self-referential way and snapping it out into the real world.</p>
<p>Expect there to be references to the aforementioned “woo-hoo!”, perhaps some kind of reverence to or fourth wall breaking surrounding the iconic green control jewel that hovers over a person’s head, and the inevitable incident where someone gets stuck in a swimming pool because the ladder suddenly disappears or wets themselves because the toilet was deleted.</p>
