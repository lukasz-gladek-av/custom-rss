		<p>Permafrost will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2026, SpaceRocket Games has announced today, but a playtest will be taking place ahead of the early access release. You can register for the Permafrost playtest now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254990/Permafrost/">Steam page</a>. Along with the early access announcement, a new trailer for Permafrost has been released showing various elements of gameplay including base building, hunting, and co-operative play.</p>

<p>In a blog post, the development team said, <em>“First of all, thank you for your support and patience throughout the last year. Your dedication to providing critical feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical troubleshooting during our demo was a literal game changer. With your help, we have been able to lock in the vision for our Early Access release – we have been in the icy trenches since – focusing on improving the core elements of the game, including stability, performance, and key gameplay foundations. So, this brings us to the release date. Permafrost will release into Early Access in 2026. We want to bring the best possible Early Access release build to you – one that’s not rushed, but rather polished and with a solid foundation, built with your feedback, reports, and requests. In other words, it’s for the best. We know it sucks to wait, but hang in there and let the devs cook, it will be worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Permafrost takes place in a world where the moon shattered and Earth plunged into a never-ending ice age. Among this icy world, players will need to find scarce resources, hunt for food, and work with each other to survive the wintry landscape. The game supports four player co-op but there may be clashes with groups that are not your own. The cold will be an ever present danger to all players, so building shelters will be necessary to survive. The development team will be releasing a deep dive on Permafrost next week to delve more into the game’s systems.</p>
