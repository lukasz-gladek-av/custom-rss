		<p>King of Meat is all about throwing yourselves into the televised fantasy dungeon challenges that are all the rage in the world of Loregok. Hacking, slashing and bashing your way through dragons, skeletons, puzzles and anything else that stands in your way, it’s a race to the finish line of this quirky gameshow… but it can also be a finish line that you yourself have designed.</p>
<p><iframe title="KING OF MEAT: Announce Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQrDgfGV_n4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s because King of Meat is another game that wholeheartedly embraces user-generated content, putting a fully-fledged Dungeon Create Mode into the hands of the players, and letting those community creations shine through with curation.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the team at Glowmade have a bit about them when it comes to making UGC-led games. Based in Guildford, Glowmade was founded by former Lionhead and MediaMolecule developers, able to draw upon the rich creativity and talent that this part of the UK is so well known for to put another spin on these community-led concepts.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to the basics. King of Meat is a survival dungeon game show for up to four players to take on together, running through room after room, each of which poses some kind of problem for you to overcome. That could be a horde of enemies to battle through, it could be some environmental puzzles to trip switches and open up doors, or potentially even a co-op oriented puzzle that requires coordination or combined smarts… or just a brutal obstacle course of spinning blades, arrow launchers and more.</p>


<p>There’s a madcap tone to it with the clash of themes and art styles –&nbsp;it feels pitched perfectly for an 8-10 year old audience – but at its core, this needs to be a solid 3D action game. For the platforming, there’s a healthy jump, Yoshi-like flutter jump and dive combo to help you cross wider gaps or avoid dangers, while getting stuck into combat is a flurry of ranged shots – which are also handy for hitting triggers from a distance – melee combos, and some ostentatious special attacks on top of that, from shockwaves, to black holes, or giant hoofed feet stomping from the sky!</p>
<p>100 official dungeons have been created by Glowmade for the game’s upcoming launch… but there’s also already a bunch of community-made levels that have been constructed through private testing phases. Just as with LittleBigPlanet and Dreams, all of this has been created using the exact same tools and capabilities as are presented to players with the Dungeon Create Mode.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting set-up for this, giving you an overarching blueprint view to let you lay out a mix of small, medium and large rooms of different shapes, blocking out your stage before you dive into the details. Once you do shift to the 3D view, the level areas are broken down into a grid for vertical adjustments, making any platforming sections you create nice and predictable in a fashion not too dissimilar to Super Mario Maker.</p>

<p>And then come all of the enemies and traps, all of the switches, all of the logic, and all the behind-the-scenes gubbins that will invariably be the barrier between a pure player and a creator. There’s simplistic adjustments to link up a switch to a door, a trigger zone to an enemy spawn, and other fundamental elements, but these are the gateway to complexities that would make the eyes of creative mortals glaze over. Already, there’s examples that Glowmade can point to of the community creating a working Simons Says machine, a game of pinball, and plenty of other ambitious stages and concepts.</p>
<p>Naturally you can then lose just as much time again sprucing up each room with custom decorations and decals, giving a world you’ve made a specific tone. Regardless of if your creation is a short jaunt or a devious challenge, once you’ve completed it to prove it’s possible and uploaded,</p>
<p>King of Meat, as with any UGC-led game, is a fascinating project to see come together. So much of the game’s charm and longevity will hinge on community creations, and having tools that are just inviting enough that people learn the complexities. What’s immediately clear is that, while hopping across to a rather different genre, the spirit of LittleBigPlanet is still alive.</p>

			<p>Atomfall was a thoroughly intriguing, if flawed, game. Set in the Great British countryside after the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history, its rendition of Cumbria featured four beautiful areas to explore, sleuth through, and shoot things in. Now it’s time to wander down the jetty, hop on a boat and visit the ominously named Wicked Isle DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wicked Isle runs in parallel to the main game, which is to say, it’s another region you can access alongside the others. This being the case, it intriguingly features a new story that is both self-contained, but also connects back to the main story and provides new endings to reach. All you have to do is go to the dock in Wyndham and chat with a grizzled, old sea captain. He’ll give you a quick boat ride to a place called Midsummer Isle if you agree to find something for him – some literally blessed mead, as it turns out.</p>


<p>This is an interesting enough pitch for those wanting a bit more Atomfall, but once things get going, you’ll quickly realise that this is largely more of the same as the main game, except now there are some monks involved. I don’t just mean that this feels similar, I mean that the specific story for this island is close to a complete retread of the plot.&nbsp;Once you realise this, you notice how little information you’re actually finding most of the time, just letters from people about the mysterious voice, being one with the soil – you know, the usual.</p>


<p>The most helpful information you gain comes from memories of conversations from many years ago, as shadows or ghosts of monks have conversations. These lack impact for a few reasons, not least of which being that you’re just stood there awkwardly watching them unfold, and it’s far from a unique method of delivering information in video games. If this DLC had been part of the original game, it would fit right in and perhaps be a highlight, but for anyone who’s completed a playthrough, an expansion needs to bring something fresh or new, and this one doesn’t. Even the new endings are extremely similar, with just a few details changed, to the ones in the main game.</p>
<p>This feeling persists into the gameplay as well. I experienced some AI oddities in my run through the main game, but in Wicked Isle they were all over the place. Enemies were getting stuck when trying to climb over something because they keep inexplicably jerking back away from the ledge, enemies were just not moving or shooting at all, clipping through cover, or just generally being poor. Maybe I got lucky on the main game playthrough, or unlucky here, but it’s felt particularly bad.</p>
<p>There’s the same mix of enemy types to encounter – bandits and the infected – but there are two new foes to face. One is a boss fight that was quite novel and fun, the other is an aquatic feral, which would be a nice surprise if the first thing I thought when I saw one wasn’t “that is a drowner from the Witcher 3, isn’t it?” because they look, move, attack, and sound exactly like them, but are even more annoying to fight because <em>you can’t dodge or block!</em></p>

<p>Returning to Atomfall also means returning to its gameplay systems. Honestly, I don’t know how I played through the game on the recommended difficulty. I was miserable when I first returned to play this DLC, constantly running out of ammunition, still wishing for a dodge or block in melee combat, the severely limited inventory, and infected enemies that can literally soak up six full shots to the head from a sniper rifle. I ended up tuning the difficulty by making ammo more common and enemies far less tough and it was a huge improvement. Sure I could still run out of ammo sometimes, but now at least I have a chance of meleeing everyone, even without being able to block, which is still one of the most mystifying decisions I’ve seen in a combat system. Walking around awkwardly in front of people to try and dodge their attacks is the least immersive form of combat I’ve ever encountered. It feels like a Monty Python skit.</p>
<p>Once I’d fixed the difficulty a bit, I was having fun. There are some highlights here mostly in the new characters, who are as delightfully odd as you’d expect, but then it decided to give me fetch quests back to the mainland. A side quest wanted me to traipse about the Interchange finding messages to discover what happened to someone, muttering swear words under my breath the entire time (that wasn’t a quest requirement, it happened naturally). Yes, your first guess about what happened to that person is correct, but the game wants you to wander around and to collect messages from areas that not only have enemies in them, but sometimes those enemies respawn or are replaced with other enemies when you slightly leave the area to look around a corner.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to bother doing this side quest, but then the main story of the DLC also sent me to three different regions on the mainland, this time to spend five seconds in each digging something up, so I thought I may as well do both missions and waste as much of my time as possible. They were both very unsatisfying and just felt like obvious padding to extend the length of the DLC.</p>
