		<p>Team Cherry is signing off 2025 and the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> this year by announcing… more Silksong! The team is cooking up the first expansion for the series, in the form of Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow, which will be available as free DLC.</p>
<p>Not only that, but there’s a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> upgrade for the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, which also has improvements for other version in the works.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDFEeeLy6ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With over 7 million purchases of the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and many more on Game Pass, Team Cherry writes that “most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands.</p>
<p>“It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.”</p>

<p>So that’s what they’re doing with Sea of Sorrow, which continues Hornet’s adventures in a new nautical themed expansion, a&nbsp;<em>free </em>expansion at that. It will bring new areas, bosses, tools, and more to toy around with.</p>
<p>But that’s not all, because the team is also working on an updated version of Hollow Knight for the Nintendo Switch 2 for release in 2026. This will bring high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and additional graphical effects that were not included in the base Switch release.</p>
<p>All platforms will be updated alongside this to bring some new features and bug fixes, and PC players can test these right now with a public beta branch on both Steam and GOG. This includes proper 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support (great for Steam Deck players), and a list of fixes and improvements as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.</li>
<li>Game now pauses while in inventory menus.</li>
<li>Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)</li>
<li>Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.</li>
<li>Reduced Grey Prince Zote’s stagger bounce height.</li>
<li>Updated Sly’s Great Slash collider to closer match visual.</li>
<li>Salubra’s Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.</li>
<li>Map panning is now smoother</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>

		<p>I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/">Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch</a> – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wardrum | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUDV13huGew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. </p>
<p>Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. </p>


<p>Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out. </p>
