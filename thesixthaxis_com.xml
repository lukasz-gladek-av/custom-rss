		<p>Nintendo has announced an Indie World Nintendo Direct stream will be taking place on Thursday, 7th August.</p>
<p>The stream will kick off at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 9AM EDT / 6AM PDT) and will run for a tight 15 minutes with a blend of announcements and updates on games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTv0HmKoUqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It follows on from the partner showcase last week, which was stuffed with a whole host of announcements like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-with-its-first-action-packed-trailer/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-a-hd-2d-prequel-coming-to-switch-switch-2-this-year/">Octopatch Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot</a>. In hindsight, there were next to no indie games included in that stream, leaving some big open goals for this Indie World stream to shoot for.</p>
<p>There’s a number of key indie titles that are expected for Switch that could make an appearance here, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-2">Hades 2</a> which is set to be a console exclusive, or the very, very highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if everyone’s wishes are fulfilled!</p>
