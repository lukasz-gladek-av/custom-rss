<p>In a statement, the development team said, <em>“The Tenderfoot Tactics team has decided to remove our game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign, which added Xbox to their priority boycott list earlier this month. We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months. We hope that the broader community will join in the pressure campaign and fight for an end to occupation and apartheid in Palestine and across the world.”</em></p>
<p>The BDS Movement has claimed, <em>“Microsoft partners with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system. It provides the Israeli military with Azure cloud and AI services that are central to accelerating Israel’s genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip. After 34 years of deep complicity with Israel’s military, the Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements of its genocide and apartheid regime.”</em></p>

<p>Tenderfoot Tactics is still available for sale on PC and Switch. Microsoft has not yet released a statement on the removal of Tenderfoot Tactics, or addressed the reasons as to why the development team took the action.</p>
