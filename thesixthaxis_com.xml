		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct stream brought a bit one hour drop of new information about Masuhiro Sakurai’s latest game, digging into changes both big and small for the game, revealing Top Ride and the brand new Road Trip mode, digging into specific menu settings, revealing a big set of Amiibo, and more.</p>
<p>A global online demo is set to take place at two points in November, on 8th-9th November and on 15th-16th November at 8AM-2PM UK time (UTC) on the first day, and then 12AM-6AM and 3PM-9PM on the second.</p>

<p>Top Ride, the top-down racing style, has returned alongside the more kart racer-style Air Ride, and the vehicular combat stylings of City Trial. Compared to the GameCube original, there’s now a follow cam and the ability for all players to have their own view of the world, which will really help with the scale and the scope of the many stages featured in the game. Additionally, since this now uses the full selection Air Ride vehicles, and has two control methods so you can race however feels more natural.</p>
<p>Air Ride is the main racing mode, though, and there’s some big news here as well. There’s nine original circuits for this game, but there’s also all nine of the original game’s circuits included as well, from Fantasy meadows and Celestial Valley to Sky Sands. You’ll need to earn these original circuits, but they’ve all been rebuilt in their original layouts with new graphics –&nbsp;given the faster cruising speed in this sequel, the lap times will be a bit faster.</p>

<p>City Trial is the vehicular combat mode, gathering up stat points to enhance your vehicle before a final Stadium battle takes place. A new Team Battle mode takes the 16-player lobbies and splits them into two teams to work together, and then everyone to face off in the same Stadium.</p>
<p>A new game mode, Road Trip, which combines Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial together in a string of challenges to take on, going head-to-head with rival characters. It builds up to encounters with a mysterious figure that provides some narrative impetus to this game’s solo play.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of this is meant to be enjoyed in multiplayer. There’s up to four player split screen, and when with two players you can choose the direction of the split-screen, which is neat. What’s good to hear is that Switch 1 controllers and the GameCube recreation controller will all be supported.</p>
<p>Heading online, you can do so socially, meeting up with friends in the Paddock, a lobby space where you run around, get to watch a big screen, select music and just hang.</p>
<p>For competitively minded players, you’ll have an online license that shows your Global Power Rating –&nbsp;literally a number of how many people you’re better than –&nbsp;and a coloured shape that acts as your rank. This rank is set individually per game mode, and can affect how City Trial matches play out. You’ll be able to customise your license with fresh backgrounds, and even sparkles.</p>
<p>Beyond all this, Sakurai-san regularly diverted to share new copy abilities, vehicles and riders. There’s a lot of characters to choose from here, including… Rock (the literal rock) and Rick, the hamster. There’s also a Transform Star vehicle, which swaps between star form and bike form modes (which feels a bit OP?), top speed Formula Star, jumping Hop Star, and so many more.</p>
<p>A full set of five Kirby Air Rider amiibo are on the way for Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Chef Kawasaki, all with swappable Star vehicles. The Tank Star can also have its tracks reoriented. The amiibo let you save and train up an AI, but can also just be scanned to change the pose and models featured in your main menu cursor.</p>

<p>Here’s some more bullet point details:</p>
<ul>
<li>All localisation languages have both male and female announcers.</li>
<li>You can set a different announcer for matches and story narration.</li>
<li>Time Trial records are tracked per machine.</li>
<li>There are no online leaderboards.</li>
<li>City Trial has a Free Run mode to let you explore Skyah, test vehicles and more. Field Events won’t happen in this mode, though.</li>
<li>A Photo Mode is available throughout the game.</li>
<li>A Stadiums-only mode is available separate from City Trial</li>
<li>You can remove stadiums from City Trial, if you don’t like them, or set filters.</li>
<li>The VS. King Dedede Stadium has been reimagined as VS. Boss against the transforming Robo Dedede.</li>
<li>The Checklist returns with rewards for certain game missions and achievements, filling in a picture puzzle.</li>
<li>There’s a new vehicle decoration feature called My Machine.</li>
<li>A Machine Market lets you use earned currency to buy the designs of other players.</li>
<li>Riders can also be styled up with headware.</li>
<li>The earned currency is Miles from actively driving.</li>
<li>You’ll earn “gummies” from defeating rivals, and can mess around with them like a gummy-obsessed Scrooge McDuck.</li>
<li>The soundtrack comes from Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare.</li>
<li>You can customise how likely tracks are to be played.</li>
<li>The main menu is themed after a desk</li>
<li>You can remap buttons, to the extend you could play the game one-handed.</li>
<li>Colour filters are in place to help with colourblindness.</li>
<li>You can change the FOV, reduce camera shake and more.</li>
<li>DLC is&nbsp;<em>not</em> planned for Kirby Air Riders – everything they want to put in the game is already there.</li>
</ul>

		<p>How do you solve a problem like using AI for video games? That’s the question every megacorp is trying to figure out right now, but amongst the countless ways that it really can’t or really shouldn’t be used –&nbsp;like, don’t use AI as an excuse for laying off human employees, please&nbsp;and thank you –&nbsp;there are a few areas that generative large language models can shine. Enter Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p><iframe title="Courtroom Chaos featuring Snoop Dogg: Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjPSCmibeFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the headlining game from Amazon Luna’s relaunch and push towards more casual gaming with GameNight –&nbsp;alongside a bunch of board game and digital game classics adapted to it – and it’s absolutely got the right kind of hook and broader audience potential. Snoop Dogg presides over a video game twist on Judge Judy or Judge John Hodgeman, where players turn up with a plaintiff and a defendant, there’s the ability to call upon expert witnesses, and then a judgement is handed down. Eminently possible on TV or in podcasting with curated cases appearing in each episode and real grievances, but nigh on impossible for traditional game design, and heck, there’s only one Snoop Dogg!</p>


<p>As with all of the titles in the GameNight library, you play Courtroom Chaos with your phone, logging into a web portal using a code in a fashion that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever Jackbox’d. Two players are assigned to be plaintiff and defendant, and asked to give some kind of personal details, speaking them into your phone. Judge Snoop Dogg then jumbles this all up and comes up with a case.</p>
<p>In our test case, it was two of the players being game developers, with the defendant accused of having inserted some rogue character creation tools that were harming development. You’re all assigned into teams from this, with the other players able to choose what kind of witness they are –&nbsp;eyewitness, expert witness, for example. You’re called in turn to give testimony, trying to play to win AI Snoop Dogg’s favour and convince him to side with you. You can strategise with your argument, maybe lean in on statistics and plausible fabrications as you play into your assigned role, and it was always quite funny to see how AI Snoop would react, the build up as the server chewed through our long and rambling arguments adding to the suspense.</p>


<p>Let’s say he’s maybe not as consistent as you’d want from an actual judge. One moment, he didn’t like my statistics, but then he loved my testimony in the final judgment, and that kind of shows the still capricious nature of LLMs in general, which Amazon will look to be tuning and training as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s an enjoyable game, though, and I can absolutely see people having a laugh while messing around with it, in the same way that people toy with generative AI tools more generally. It helps, of course, that it will be bundled in with the Amazon Prime memberships, accessible wherever you get Amazon’s streaming platform, and that’s all key to Amazon Luna’s new pitch.</p>
<p>This game, and a whole bunch of others, are just there and waiting for you to stream and play, if you’re a Prime subscriber. In contrast to Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, the relaunch of Amazon Luna will only have a limited selection of big budget AAA controller-based games. There’s still big hitters like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Hogwarts Legacy, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, but GamesNight is the dedicated section for games you can just play with your phone.</p>
<p>On day one there’s 29 GameNight titles, including a bunch of Jackbox standalone classics, as well as some specially adapted games like Tetris Effect: Connected and Garfield Kart 2, and board games like Cluedo. Courtroom Chaos isn’t Amazon’s only original effort, though.</p>

<p>Flappy Golf Party is…. well, it’s Flappy Bird meets minigolf. All the players have a bird-like golfball and there’s an enclosed stage to race through, flapping to the right or to the left, gliding, and trying to get to the hole first. It’s simple, fun and easily accessible, and honestly I wanted to play more than just the few holes we got to try!</p>
<p>The same can be said of Draw &amp; Guess, which is a drawing riff on a game of telephone. You’ll constantly cycle between drawing from a prompt on your phone, and then guessing what the prompt someone else was given from their drawing. That guess is then passed along, and around we go several times before we see the results and vote. I just wish there was a little more panache to this game’s presentation, taking a few leafs out of Jackbox’s book to have multiple rounds, some quirky scoring, a break in the middle before mixing up themes. As it is, it feels a little too simplistic… but that certainly helps it be very immediate and easy to play.</p>

<p>Courtroom Chaos is clearly what Amazon want to hang their hat on. It’s got the production values, the big name star, the inventive use of AI chat to power it, and it shows the potential of playing games in the cloud. How Amazon follows that up for GameNight will be fascinating to see. They’ve promised that new games will be added regularly, and this library could easily become a go-to avenue for a family gaming session where you don’t have to worry too much about irregular gamers feeling excluded by learning gamepad buttons.</p>
