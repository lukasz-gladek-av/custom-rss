		<p>FBC Firebreak, the 3v3 co-op shooter set in the Control universe, blasted onto the scene a few short months ago, and while it was relatively well-received, the team at Remedy have set out to make sure it reaches its full potential with the game’s first major new update, coming under the title Breakpoint. This massive update includes various new improvements, including new missions, additional gun mods and a host of new enemies to blast to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Breakpoint Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the update trailer, Breakpoint really does look like it takes the game up a notch, and the idiosyncratic action of Firebreak looks better than ever before. The key changes and additions that the team have made are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Playable Crisis</b>&nbsp;– Outbreak: A mission set in the Research Sector where Firebreakers face a dangerous Mold infestation, new enemies, and unique challenges.</li>
<li><b>Crisis Board</b>&nbsp;– A redesigned structure that replaces the Job Board, delivering curated missions with more dynamic and unpredictable play.</li>
<li><b>Gun Mods</b> – 27 weapon modifiers that add customisation, power, and flexibility to every loadout.</li>
<li><b>Expanded Arsenal</b>&nbsp;– Three new heavy weapons and three new grenades for added firepower and tactical depth.</li>
<li><b>New Threats –</b>&nbsp;Five additional enemies, including Mold-specific foes and new Hiss enemies with variants.</li>
<li><b>Economy &amp; Progression Overhaul</b>&nbsp;– Gear is now fully powered upon unlocking, and currencies have been streamlined for a clearer, more rewarding experience.</li>
<li><b>Improved Onboarding</b>&nbsp;– A new tutorial, orientation videos, and redesigned early-game flow make it easier for new players to join the fight.</li>
<li><b>Gameplay Improvements</b>&nbsp;– More impactful augments and devices, improved harmful condition visuals, better survivability options, and full Crisis Kit access from level one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remedy have said that they’re going to continue to expand <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> with further, completely free updates. The next major Update, codenamed “Rogue Protocol”, will arrive in late November 2025, introducing a brand-new game mode and much-requested cross-platform voice chat to strengthen teamwork. A balance and tuning update will then follow in December, before another Major Update is currently planned for March 2026, which will add new content to the game, including a new Crisis Kit.</p>
<p>Tef <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">quite liked Firebreak FBC at launch</a>, but he felt it still had a ways to go, saying, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

<p>With Breakpoint, it really feels like Remedy are addressing some of those issues, and here’s hoping that it’ll bring even more people into the Firebreak fold. As part of that, the game is 40% off on Steam from today, so if you’ve been on the fence about jumping in, now is the perfect time to.</p>

		<p>Ah, Advance Wars. Now <em>there</em> was a perfect strategy game. While we have had an Advance Wars game in recent memory, it wasn’t really a new one, not least because developer Intelligent Systems seem far too busy Fire Embleming to fit one in. So, it falls to other teams to advance the armed forces side of the tactical strategy genre. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/03/tiny-metal-review/">Tiny Metal</a> was certainly a decent first attempt, but with its full sequel, the team at Area 35, Inc. are looking to bring the genre hurtling like a cannon shell into the modern day.</p>
<p><iframe title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That fundamentally means a complete reworking of the visuals. This is what an Advance Wars game should look like in 2025, and the stylised anime-style visuals retain a hand-drawn roughness that makes it feel more like it’s a manga come to life. Tiny Metal 2 switches up the viewpoints when your units engage in combat too, and this simple dose of variety makes them all the more alluring. We’ll all still eventually skip through them on our way to global domination, but they look great.</p>


<p>Our hands-on demo at TGS framed its combat around the Tokyo Game Show itself, tasking the player with protecting it from the incoming threat posed by the evil enemy general Tsukomo. In reality, I’m not sure how accurate the battle map was to downtown Chiba, but it was still a nice touch.</p>


<p>As with the original game, you’re invited to choose your general to take their army into battle, or should that be generals? In a new wrinkle, you pick a second leader to back you up as an ally and add their units as support to your own, but this also opens the door to playing Tiny Metal 2 in two-player co-op, handing this second commander over to another player. This will give players even more tactical options, looking to combine two generals that have synergetic skills and abilities, and bringing friends together as they forge their way across the battlefield. I wonder whether that extends to local head-to-head play too, but there’s certainly support for massive 8-player online skirmishes.</p>
<p>Our playthrough showcased two of the returning allied generals, with Nathan your standard, balanced everyman option, while his ally, Wolfram, turns things up a notch with her versatile infantry.</p>

<p>It’s hard to get a full grasp of the nuances of tactical warfare in the midst of the cacophony of the Tokyo Game Show floor, but Tiny Metal 2 really does go for an ‘if it ain’t broke’ outlook, delivering grid-based strategy that will be instantly recognisable to fans of Advance Wars and the first Tiny Metal game. This sequel’s major new contribution to the tight tactical action is the addition of sea-based combat to the mix. The ocean-based craft we see here – a cruiser, a lander, and a submarine – are all directly related to their inspiration’s own units, and Tiny Metal 2 isn’t exactly shy about it.</p>
<p>When Intelligent Systems doesn’t seem to be about to bring us a Fire Emblem-esque reimagining of its more down-to-earth army franchise, though, it’s hard to knock Tiny Metal 2 for taking the genre forward.</p>

<p>The turn-based action does exactly what it needs to, giving you the clear visual markers to help you develop your strategy, showing you how far each unit will go, and how far it can fire. There’s also a clear indicator for each unit about its strengths and weaknesses, which should help players get up to speed quicker than ever before; particularly useful for multiplayer, where you might end up playing with people who haven’t played an Advance Wars title or something similar before.</p>
<p>While the visuals and the art design have taken a huge leap forward, one of the key things that felt like it needed tweaking was the strength of the audio. Weak gunshots alongside huge explosions create an audio disparity that I found really distracting, and I hope they can tweak the sound levels just a little before launch.</p>
<p>Tiny Metal 2 takes a bold step across the grid-based genre with reinvigorated visuals nestling up to instantly recognisable tactical combat. I’m really interested to see how much importance is placed on the game’s narrative – particularly with the game engine and visuals adding a heap of character – and, for me, it’s immediately jumped into my list of 2026’s must plays.</p>
