		<p>Nintendo has released Nintendo Switch system update 20.0.0 today, laying some of the foundations for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2’s release in June</a>. With version 20.0.0, the Nintendo Switch now has the new Virtual Game Card DRM system, support for GameShare, a system transfer utility for Switch 2, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-card-overhaul-for-switch-switch-2-digital-games/">Virtual Game Cards</a> are an overhaul for the way that digital game licenses are managed on Nintendo Switch systems, turning every purchased game into a, well, a virtualised game card. This system formally lets you load and eject games on an individual basis across two consoles, sharing out offline access in a way that was not possible under the previous system, as well as allowing you to lend games to other members of your Nintendo Account family group.</p>


<p>This does now remove the game sharing loophole of letting to people play from a single game license by using a Primary Switch for one person and then online authentication for the other. There is also a limitation that game cards can only be shared by a single used between two Nintendo Switch consoles, though an Online License check option is also available for those who own and use 3 or more systems with one account.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the unrelated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare feature is now added</a>. The Nintendo Switch 2 is able to share multiplayer games to other consoles in certain titles and situations, so all players can play on their own systems. This can be used to share back to the Nintendo Switch when playing locally, and is a Switch 2-only feature when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">sharing online via GameChat</a>.</p>
<p>And a new System Transfer feature has been added. This can perform a direct transfer from a Switch to Switch 2 using local networking, but for those who will be selling or trading in their Switch before activating a Switch 2, you will also be able to temporarily upload all your data to Nintendo’s cloud and have that downloaded to the new console.</p>

<p>Oh, and the News icon is now green and the eShop icon is now red, which will break the brains of anyone who was used to them being red and orange, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Nintendo Switch version 20.0.0:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.0.0 (Released April 29, 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following icons for new features have been added to the <strong>HOME Menu</strong>:

<li>This feature cannot be used between two Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and/or Nintendo Switch Lite systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Nintendo Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2.</li>
<li>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</li>
</ul>
</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/gaming-accessory-maker-8bitdo-halts-shipments-to-the-us-due-to-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Popular gaming accessory maker <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/8bitdo">8BitDo</a> is halting shipments to the US from its Chinese warehouses and manufacturing because of the impact that Trump’s tariffs are having. Existing stock within US warehouses will continue to be sold, but there’s no restocks coming until the situation has been resolved or worked around.</p>
<p>They’re joining other companies like gaming handheld maker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/562454/retro-handheld-industry-retroid-anbernic">Anbernic</a>, PC case maker <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/pc-case-maker-hyte-halts-shipments-to-us-due-to-trumps-tariffs">Hyte</a> and others in halting shipments to the US through the uncertain times for Chinese imports ahead.</p>


<p>Originally known for their retro controller recreations and replacement boards for classic gamepads, 8BitDo’s brand has grown in the last few years as they’ve shipped more general purpose controllers for all modern platforms, whether it’s a full-sized Ultimate 2 controller, a retro-style mechanical keyboard and mouse, or the tiny Micro controller for quick pick-up gaming. They’re among the many accessory makers who have adopted Hall Effect sensors for their analogue sticks, while maintaining comparable or lower prices to first party controllers for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p>
<p>The pause in shipping to the US is down to two policies that the Trump administration has put in place, with the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and an end to <em>de minimis&nbsp;</em>exemptions for shipments valued under $800 coming about as close to a trade ban as you can get without actually putting one in place. While there’s a stay of execution for smartphones and other consumer electronics, video game consoles and accessories are classified as toys by the US ITC.</p>
<p>The full impact of Trump’s tariffs is yet to really be felt, as many companies with Chinese supply chains rushed to get imports through before tariffs would be applied and some of the biggest tech giants have diversified their manufacturing hubs to use other countries throughout Asia – Apple, for example, has built up manufacturing in India, Nintendo is using Vietnam for some Switch 2 production, and so on – and so are able to get the lower 10% tariff rate that is applied to the rest of the world… for now.</p>

<p>There is the looming threat of the higher tariffs for almost all countries that were announced back at the start of April coming back, but given just how much manufacturing is still centralised in China, the US will start to feel the impact of this very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/report-ea-lays-off-more-than-300-staff-and-cancels-rumoured-titanfall-spin-off/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>
