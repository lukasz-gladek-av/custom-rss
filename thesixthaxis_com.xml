		<p>Lion Shield has announced that players will be able to get their hands on the Roman city builder Nova Roma, with the date being January 22nd 2026. The Nova Roma early access release will be available on both Steam and Epic Game Store. The game is not just about mimicking Rome, but striking out and building an improved version.</p>

<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly.</p>
<p>Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>

		<p>Ion Lands has announced that its cyberpunk slice of life RPG Nivalis, set in the same world as Cloudpunk, will not be making a 2025 release date. Last year, the development team was aiming for a Spring 2025 release but that passed. However, the team did want to get the game out this year. However, there is still work to be done, so Ion Lands has made the decision to delay Nivalis to 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nivalis | Official Summer 2024 Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYykZ9RBo3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Ion Lands said, <em>“As you know, our goal over the past year has been to launch the game within 2025. The progress we’ve made in recent months has been both steady and substantial, allowing us to refine every aspect of Nivalis – our unique take on the slice-of-life genre – including all the intertwined, dystopian, and mysterious stories unfolding throughout its streets. However, there’s still one final piece of the puzzle missing.</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, we’re deeply focused on the voice over: we’ve just completed the casting process for over 100 new voice roles after our first casting of 32 roles for our demo 2 years ago. We have received more than 8,000 auditions this time. In Nivalis, there will be around 135 primary and secondary fully voiced characters, for a total of about 200,000 words. They will bring to life the multitude of complex personalities you’ll meet in the game. It’s a massive undertaking that we’re carefully overseeing, because for us this is a key element: as we’ve said many times before, we want the Nivalis experience to be as immersive as possible. So – as some of you correctly guessed after last month’s devlog – between casting, recording, and implementing the voiceover, releasing the game in 2025 would risk compromising its quality.</em></p>
<p><em>For that reason, we’ve made the decision to officially move Nivalis’ release a few months ahead into 2026. This will also allow us to dedicate all the time needed for additional testing, optimization, polishing, and balancing, to ensure the smoothest experience possible. We’re currently working closely with our publisher to determine a specific launch date – which we hope to share before the end of the year. Soon, we’ll let you know when we’ll be able to celebrate ‘Nivalis Day’. Thank you all for your patience, understanding, and incredible support – it’s what gives us the strength and motivation to push through this final stretch.”</em></p>

<p>In Nivalis, you begin with a small business, such as a noodle stand or a small nightclub. Your goal is to grow from these modest origins into a huge enterprise that Nivalis’ citizens will rave about and want to spend their time and money at. However, there’s more to Nivalis than just building up a business. You can get to know some of the city’s inhabitants, go fishing, or just dedicate time to home decoration. Delving into the underworld of Nivalis is also an option, if you want to go that route.</p>

<p><i>“We are very excited to share our game,&nbsp;<b>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire</b>, with fans across the world on 19 March 2026”</i>, says Mateusz Michalak, CEO &amp; Founder, Fumi Games.&nbsp;<i>“Set in the cartoon-noir city of Mouseburg, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire offers a unique mix of explosive FPS action and hand-drawn rubber hose animation. Stepping into the shoes of Private Investigator Jack Pepper – played by the inimitable Troy Baker – will be an experience that players will not forget!”</i></p>
<p><wbr>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>
