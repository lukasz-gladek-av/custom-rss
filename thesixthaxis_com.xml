		<p>IO Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> has been delayed by two months to 27th May 2026.</p>
<p>In a classic text image announcement on social media, IOI CEO and game director Hakan Abrak writes:</p>


<p>“007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p>
<p>“The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.”</p>
<p>What’s a bit daft is that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-gets-a-march-2026-release-date/">they only announced the previous March release date back in September</a>, and just had a splashy cast announcement at The Game Awards, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lenny-kravitz-revealed-as-bawma-in-007-first-light/">Lenny Kravitz playing the villain Bawma</a>. And then they’ve waited right up until Christmas Eve Eve to confirm this latest delay…</p>

<p>I’ve no doubt that IO are very, very thankful that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">GTA 6 was recently delayed to the back end of 2026</a>, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">previously been slated for 26th May 2026</a>. Otherwise the studio would have really painted themselves into a corner with 007: First Light wanting more polish. They’re pretty lucky to now have this extra breathing room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>
<p>So… 007: First Light is coming out on 27th May 2026 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>
