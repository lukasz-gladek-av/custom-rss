		<p>The story so far: In December 2024, Tencent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/tencents-light-of-motiram-looks-very-very-familiar/">revealed Light of Motiram</a> and everyone, and we mean everyone, said the same thing – they had ripped off Sony’s Horizon series, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>The game featured a red-haired girl fighting very familiar mechanical beasts with a bow and staff, creeping through waving red grass to avoid detection, gliding with a glider, and interacting with characters wearing equally familiar costumes. They also nicked the Ghost from Destiny as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In July this year,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/sony-sue-tencent-clone-horizon-light-of-motiram/"> Sony sued Tencent</a> and the lawsuit stated that Light of Motirm is a “slavish clone” of its games, that copies multiple elements that would confuse consumers. They also reference many video games websites that noted the similarities. They asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Tencent had pitched a new Horizon game to Sony but they declined the offer. It seems that Tencent went and made it anyway, and when Sony were made aware of the clone they contacted Tencent to try to solve things without lawyers. At this point someone a Tencent decided the best thing to do was to pitch their Horizon idea to Sony again. Flabs were probably very gasted over at Sony at that point.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today, where Tencent have wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine. One of the original screenshots does remain but the protagonist is in shadow under a glider and could be anyone really.</p>
<p>The new description is very generic.</p>
<p>“Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.”</p>

		<p>Tron Catalyst developer Bithell Games has been unable to secure funding for a new project and has laid off the “majority of full time staff”. Mike Bithell took to<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b"> Bluesky</a> to explain the situation and while it’s awful that people have to lose their jobs, at least this boss cares.</p>
<p>“Sad news today, Bithell Games, having been unable to secure a new larger scale project, is reducing in size. This means that eleven jobs are being made redundant. This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff.&nbsp; This constitutes the majority of our full time staff,” reads the post.</p>


<p>“It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages.”</p>
<p>“Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less.”</p>
<p>The layoffs will not affect any existing self-published games and these will continue to receive support.</p>

<p>We have always been fans of Bithell; I recall chatting with him just as his breakout hit, Thomas Was Alone, was released on PS Vita. Since then he has gone from strength to strength, moving from indie titles like Volume to games based on massive franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/john-wick-hex-review/">John Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/tron-catalyst-review/">Tron.</a> He has also has talked to us <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/interview-mike-bithell-on-distilling-the-action-of-john-wick-hex/">numerous tim</a>es, and also came to chat on the much missed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/29/podcast-the-year-according-to-mike-bithell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSA Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>We wish the laid-off staff and those remaining at Bithell Games all the best.</p>
