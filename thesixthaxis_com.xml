		<p>Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/?_branch_match_id=1106531065027356413&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz0tKzskvTsxLT81JLdZLLCjQy8nMy9avTMq39M32KsuKSrKvK0pNSy0qysxLj08qyi8vTi2ydU1JTwUA19eTCEIAAAA%3D">NBC Los Angeles</a> is reporting. According to the report, Vince Zampella and another passenger were travelling along the &nbsp;Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway in a Ferrari when the car came off the road and hit a concrete barrier, ejecting one of the passengers from the car while the other was trapped in the vehicle which caught fire, dying at the scene. The ejected passenger died of their injuries at the hospital.</p>
<p>Vince Zampella has been a major figure in the games industry and credited as one of the major creators behind Call of Duty having founded Infinity Ward, releasing Call of Duty 2, and the breakout hit of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare which catapulted the series to being a household name. This was followed by Modern Warfare 2. Vince was fired from Infinity Ward by Activision along with Jason West, going on to form Respawn Entertainment, releasing Titanfall, Titanfall 2, Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. In 2020, Vince was put in charge of DICE Los Angeles and then in 2021 the entire Battlefield series.</p>


<p>Our thoughts are with Vince’s loved ones.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>

<p>In our Cronos: The New Dawn review, Steve said, <em>“Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.”</em></p>

		<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay has received a brand new mode as part of update 1.09, challenging players to take on the Boss Rush Challenge. To access the Boss Rush Challenge players need to complete the main campaign. The Boss Rush Challenge will vary the number of bosses per stage with higher difficulty, and they will get progressively stronger. HP and army strength will carry over through a stage and when a Patapon falls they will do so without dropping a cap, but all health will be restored once fully completing a stage. Along with the new Boss Rush Challenge, there are some additional fixes too.</p>
