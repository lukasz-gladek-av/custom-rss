			<p>You really do owe it to yourself, to your games, and to the audio designers and composers out there to make sure you can hear the games you’re playing with the best fidelity possible. Outside of a new GPU for PC gamers, or a fancy new OLED TV or monitor, high quality earbuds or headphones are perhaps the best way to upgrade your entire gaming experience.&nbsp;With the Edifier Hecate GX05, a pair of gaming-focussed true wireless earbuds, Hecate may have won the award for most over-engineered earbud case, but frankly, I couldn’t love it any more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edifier Hecate GX05 - 15ms Ultra Low Latency Gaming Earbuds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNT1iS7OLGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The unboxing experience is immediately a bit different. The GX05 arrives in a serious plastic case emblazoned with the Hecate logo and a big red clasp. Opening it feels like you’re going to find a top-quality watch inside rather than a pair of earbuds, but you immediately see the metal form of the GX05’s charging case nestled at the centre of the package.</p>


<p>It looks, for want of anything else, like a prop from a Star Wars movie. It’s seriously heavy, with its metal build adding both weight and the sense that this is a premium product. The earbuds, and the 2.4Ghz USB-C dongle nestle inside, protected by a three-armed metal frame that rotates with a supremely satisfying click. Rotating this frame also starts the RGB lighting, with the case itself and each earbud boasting matching lighting strips. I expected a hologram of Princess Leia to jump from it, and the only disappointment was that it didn’t…</p>
<p>All that weight and the many edges mean that the Hecate GX05’s case is not one you’re likely to pop in your pocket, and probably not in a bag with any other uprotected electronics – the zinc alloy build means it’s more than likely to scratch any screen it comes into contact with. Still, it makes a great focal piece if it’s kept on the side, or, perhaps it would do a great job as an illuminated paperweight.</p>


<p>The premium experience is borne out by the GX05’s £149.99 RRP, though if you’re willing to import, it looks as though you can find it for well under that. The earbuds themselves match the silver finish of the case, though rather than being fashioned from metal, they’re light and sturdy plastic. The body of each is a little chunky, but I found they stayed easily in place, and looked sleek enough to any observers, especially with the ice blue RGB strips lending them something of a Tron look.</p>
<p>The RGB is controlled via the case, with the pairing button on the underside taking double duty to cycle through the different solid or breathing colours. Those looking for something a little more subdued will be happy to know that you can turn them off altogether, but if you do that, are you really a G4M3R?</p>
<p>If you’re connecting via Bluetooth, the GX05 is capable of the standard SBC codec or the high-resolution LHDC 5.0, meaning that it’s certified for Hi-Res wireless audio, but only if you’ve got a device capable of it. I’ve got a brand-new Honor Magic V3 and it supports LDAC but not LHDC, meaning that I’m stuck to the painfully ordinary SBC unless I use the dongle. Using SBC, the sound is fine, but far from special.</p>
<p>The GX05 comes to life when you use the dongle. Given that most things made in the last couple of years are equipped with USB-C, it worked perfectly with my MacBook, Nintendo Switch, the Magic V3 and my PC, and the audio quality is absolutely fantastic, the 10mm drivers delivering crystal clear audio directly to your ears.</p>

<p>I did find that it seemed more important to get the eartip sizing right than with some earbuds, but once I’d selected the right one, it delivered both high and low frequencies with stunning detail. Given the Hi-Res certification, it’s almost reductive to say that I was able to hear parts of a song that I’d never heard before, but in the case of Papa Roach’s Liar – on heavy rotation thanks to watching them live this week – it sounded like an entirely new song.</p>
<p>The Hecate GX05 do a fantastic job with music, but they are designed for gaming, with a low 15ms latency helping keep you in tune with the on-screen action, while the high-quality audio delivers every detail. I put them through their paces with some Overwatch 2, and I could hear the enemy team running for their life – I might have imagined that bit – while picking up the movements of those still coming to try and take mine.</p>
<p>The microphones do a decent job of keeping things clear and concise, letting your teammates know exactly why you’re not very happy as no one plays the objective as they run off in random directions – I hate multiplayer gaming sometimes. That’s not the GX05’s fault though, and they’ve proven to be a great companion for gaming, no matter what’s happening on screen.</p>

		<p>Ready for something to brighten your day? If you’re a fan a vibrant, colourful games with a great art style you might remember Awesomenauts, an incredibly fun 2D online shooter from back in the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Well, former members of the team have been tinkering away on Nubs, a vibrant, colourful arena brawler that takes the Awesomenauts philosophy and turns it to smacking people about. It looks awesome, and as of today, you can make your own mind up, with a brand <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3471400/Nubs_Demo/">new demo dropping on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nubs! - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrPukGmW4vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I love the art style here, with a grotesque but cute vibe that’s all the better for swinging a sword at strangers on the internet. Coming from dual developers Rangatang and Glowfish Interactive, based in the Netherlands and Belgium, it’s a collaborative piece of work that’s hoping to capture gamers around the world.</p>
<p>You can expect multiplayer carnage with up to four friends, and there’s both local couch multiplayer and global online play too. All of that action is going to take place on multi-level arenas, filled with traps and other foes to keep you from victory, while there’s a heap of different game modes and that current favourite, a roguelite progression system to keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The Nubs are the cute and spiky protagonists, and there’s a great level of humour here that I can definitely get behind. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Nubs, and look out for a preview of the demo coming soon.</p>


<p>Rangatang Studio was formed from the ashes of Ronimo Studio, the developer of Awesomenauts. Nubs was saved from development hell by the team, carrying on with the work started by Ronimo, and this demo is your chance to see exactly what they’ve been working on. Go check it out!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Robobeat Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robobeat-review.1105605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/robobeat/">Robobeat</a> is a rhythm-based first-person shooter that, like a couple of recent titles such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/21/metal-hellsinger-review/">Metal: Hellsinger</a>, combines fast-paced combat with a beat-matched shooting mechanic. You play as Ace, a bounty hunter who has been called on to find a cyborg named Frazzer, but that might not be the whole story.</p>
<p>To find your mark you zip through hundreds of fairly basic procedurally generated rooms packed with robots which you can destroy with one of the many guns found in the game. Each has waves of enemies as well as jump pads, spikes and other things that will do their best to drain your health. It’s like a procedurally generated Doom, but thee’s a rhythmic shooter element drizzled on top with the ability to choose the soundtrack that accompanies your rampage.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROBOBEAT | Console Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xSVU39hNnw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re graded on how close to the beat of the music you fire your weapons, trying to chain beats together and masting combos to lead to more effective and stylish combat sequences. Combining weapon attacks with movement abilities like the Hook can create powerful combos that deal significant damage to enemies. The mechanic for engaging the power-up combinations does take a while to master and in the heat of the battle it’s very easy to mess them up, but they are satisfying once you have a handle on the controls. During each run you may also get a chance to pick up cards which further enhance your skills by adding bonus effects like fire or reduced damage.</p>
<p>While the maps are procedurally generated you do get clues as to what the next room will hold so once you have cleared a room you can take a second to get your breath back and decide where to go next, more enemies or perhaps a detour to pick up a new weapon blueprint, or a new soundtrack. The game features a variety of ranged and melee weapons from the usual pistols and shotguns to the more esoteric choices such as [ing-pong bat and ball, each offering unique advantages and playstyles. I found the shotguns to be great fun.</p>

<p>In general, I do recommend you tweak the default values for the aim assist as this is incredibly strong and often had my camera swinging off wildly to track an enemy in the background, despite one already being in my sights.</p>

<p>For those who can’t dance, Robobeat offers the unique option of turning off the beat-matching mechanic and playing the game as a standard procedural shooter. This may seem counter to the point of the game but it does allow those without any sense of rhythm to play, which is a nice touch. You might find yourself heading to that option anyway, as the game does get rather difficult as you work your way through the levels. All your deaths will be your fault – there’s no nasty traps or silly game logic – but it does get incredibly frantic, especially during boss battles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the option to import your music which is found in the PC version is not available on PlayStation, so you are stuck with the in-game soundtracks which are mostly pounding EDM tunes with a few rock tracks thrown in for good measure. Personally. I found them to be all quite good, but if you’re not a dance music fan this may not be the game for you, at least on consoles.</p>
<p>There’s also an interesting story to uncover with notes scattered around explaining what has been going on, and glitchy videos seem to suggest an even bigger story. You don’t have to chase these, but it does add an extra layer to the game.</p>

		
		

<p>The least interesting part of Robobeat is its graphics. Everything is fairly blocky and the enemy designs are quite generic, however this is the work of one developer, Simon Fredholm, and he’s done a great job in everything else.</p>
