            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Today, we’re rounding off the first 20 games in our Most Wanted of 2025 series, counting down from 35 to 31. There is a good mix of games in the list below from psychological horrors and the fate of some giant robots, to a fresh take on a belove musou franchise. Let’s dig in, shall we?</p>
<h2>35 – The Alters</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live with yourself? It is a question you may have pondered? Would your copy be exactly like you, or look like you but have a different view of things. Enter The Alters, 11 Bit Studios new psychological survival horror in which that question is answered, though in a very stressful environment that will push anyone to their limits.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are Jan and Jan and Jan and Jan and, well you get the idea. Jan is a space builder trapped on an alien planet. He wants to get home but to do that he has to survive and restore his ship. It is a job he cannot do alone, but he can create Alters of himself. They are clones but with their own personalities, wants, needs, and stress points. If you don’t manage each individual’s needs or meet their expectations things will get tense, and the Jans will turn on each other. Probably not wise to say something like “Sure, Jan” sarcastically.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/the-alters-demo-pc-xbox-ps5/">The Alters demo</a> is available now.</p>
<h2>34 – Sleight of Hand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC, Game Pass – TBC</em></p>
<p>Sleight of Hand has one of the best descriptions going for it, with developer RiffRaff Games calling it a third-person card-slinging occult noir stealth sim. What more could you want? You are Lady Luck, an occult detective and former witch, who is taking on one last job. A job that has her meeting her past head on as she is tasked with going to Steeple City and bringing down her former coven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sleight of Hand Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBHg3xKnYTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The card slinging element comes from one of the core game mechanics, which are Lady Luck’s cards. She has cards imbued with magical abilities that can be used for all sorts, like creating a smokescreen, use smoke based attacks, and set traps. There will be different cards to use, allowing you to customise your deck which in turn determines your playstyle? Will you favour stealth cards or more attack based cards. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will be on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<h2>33 – Slay The Spire 2</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 has a lot of expectation behind it after the original was received so well. This is a sequel removing itself from any narrative connection to the first game by being set 1000 years later, introducing a new cast of slayers that are equipped with their own cards, as well as new archetypes to master.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 will change on every run, and you will have to deal with the foes and challenges that are thrown in front of you with the cards you have. You will need to build and rebuild your decks until you have a set that can master some of the tougher challenges ahead. Slay The Spire 2 is planned for Steam Early Access early this year.</p>
<h2>32 – Transformers: Reactivate</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – TBC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers: Reactivate was announced for consoles and PC</a>, at the tail end of 2022 during The Game Awards. The game is a 1-4 player action game. It was revealed through a cinematic trailer showing no Transformers in action, but from the point of view of what we assume are fallen Autobots, who have met their match against an enemy called The Legion. This is not about protecting Earth from an invasion, because it has fallen to The Legion already. Instead, it seems this is about resistance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TRANSFORMERS: REACTIVATE Official Announce Trailer | The Game Awards" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Transfomers Reactivate there have been precisely zero major updates. First the closed beta for 2023 did not take place, and the game is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Maybe, we’ll hear more in 2025 and get a surprise release?</p>
<h2>31 – Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 17th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a major refresh for the Dynasty Warriors series, taking it right back to its roots. Players are a nameless warrior that has lost his memories, and is thrust right into China’s Three Kingdom’s period. It is a time of war and strife with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Chibi taking place.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not just about taking out thousands of enemies in a matter of minutes using loads of different combos and skills. There is also an RPG side to it. As you complete missions and tasks you will earn XP, which in turn translates to your character rising up the military ranks and earning new skills. You will also build bonds with other characters. There are a lot of new things that even veteran fans of the series will discover, and Dom wrote about them after spending four hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game recently, ahead of the demo release, saying that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors Origins takes the series back to its roots to find its future</a>.</p>
<p><em>Another batch done, we’ll see you tomorrow for five more!</em></p>

		<p>The first few days of a year are always a bit sleepy in the game’s industry. It takes a little while for those press releases to start rolling in, for the announcements and trailers to drop, and developers and publishers alike are wary of launching too soon after everyone’s Christmas spending. So, it’s a quiet week for this round-up, but here’s what’s happened.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally, there hasn’t been all that much news in the past few weeks, so here’s the sum total of our reporting:</p>

<p>So… that’s just about it for this weekend. Things will no doubt pick up next week, not least because of CES bringing some GPU announcements from Nvidia and AMD. We’ll see you then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-40-to-36/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just like the music charts, we are now entering the Top 40 of the games we are looking forward to this year. The countdown here may throw up some surprises, with games maybe not being where you would expect them to be in this countdown. Without further ado, let us commence the Top 40 countdown with a musical number…</p>
<h2>40 – Ratatan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, NSW, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Patapon lovers, rejoice! Revealed towards the end of 2024, producer Hiroyuki Kotani announced a spiritual follow up to Patapon with Ratatan. Ratatan is a rhythm roguelike action game, that will combine the beat of the music with the action on screen, with up to 100 characters fighting on screen at any one time. Players can also play in four player co-op.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HR9r-LXLGnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RATATAN’s roguelike element comes from the fact that after each battle players are rewarded with different power ups and awards, with these changing on each run. Ratatan is accompanied by Cobuns, and it is they who get these power ups to use in battles and trials that are on their path.</p>

<h2>39 – Hell Is Us</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Hell Is Us was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/04/12/hell-is-us-nacon-trailer/"> first announced back in 2022</a>, and after a long period of quiet development, we were treated to 1<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/15-minute-hell-is-us-gameplay-video-explains-lack-of-maps-and-quest-markers/">5 minutes of gameplay</a> in October that gave us a good long look into the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it9wGffvYGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hell Is Us is set in the fictional country of Hadea, which has been torn apart by war. Players will have to explore the world with melee weapons and a drone, which will help navigate as well as face off the dangerous creatures that wander it. Players won’t be able to rely on map markers and waypoints, instead having to learn the world itself and pay attention to everything happening in it, and listen to what people are saying to figure it out.</p>
<h2>38 – Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Probably the shortest entry on this list as there is so little official information on it, and yet such surety of what this will offer. These remakes of the earliest Dragon Quest games were announced back in June alongside a re-reveal for Dragon Quest III HD-2D, a long in development project that built up to release in November getting a<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/"> 9/10 in our review.</a></p>
<p>Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD will continue the narrative chronologically, and it is likely it will have the same features as Dragon Quest III HD-2D, including HD-2D graphics, an improved battle system, and a large world to explore.</p>
<h2>37 – Eternal Strands</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands is another one that is coming early in 2025. This month, in fact. Eternal Strands has a huge and expansive open world that can all be explored, which is called the Enclave. Unfortunately, the Enclave has largely been invaded and taken over by a force known as the Surgeborn, an otherworldly enemy that has trapped the people in a smaller and smaller corner of it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enter the Weaver, Brynn. She is on a mission to push back the Surgeborn, liberating the Enclave from their incursion. It will not be an easy fight as the Surgeborn consist of towering creatures that will prove a challenge to take down. However, Brynn has access to weapons and magical abilities to fight back, as well as being able to use the environment to help her. You can use enemy attacks against each other as well to even the odds. The world can be manipulated so new paths can be created showing hidden parts of the Enclave. Be careful though, as the world is dangerous and destructible.</p>
<h2>36 – Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>
<p><em>NSW – 2025</em></p>
<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A was announced back in February 2024, another spin off following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>. However, where that game jumped back hundreds of years in time, Pokémon Legends Z-A is set in a modern setting and swaps the wilds for one city setting, that being the Paris inspired Lumiose City. The city itself is undergoing a major redevelopment plan to make it easier for Pokémon and people to co-exist within it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A releases simultaneously worldwide in 2025!​" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uq-Znr_jGIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That will mean Pokémon will be roaming around Lumiose City, so you will be trying to catch them all as people go about their lives. We do know Mega Evolutions will return, and… that is pretty much all we do know!</p>
<p>There have been no further official updates regarding the starter Pokemon, how the gameplay will work, and what the city will look like. What we can say is that Pokémon Legends Z-A is expected in 2025 for the Switch, and we’d bet it’s a cross-gen game for Switch 2 as well.</p>
