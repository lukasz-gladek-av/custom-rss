<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 expands massively on the original game, with powerwashing just being one of the activities in the game. The town of Muckingham &nbsp;will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham. There will be additional locations to explore too including &nbsp;Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. You will have access to new tools including an abseiling rig and cherry picker to reach those hard to reach spots.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator 2 preview, Stefan said, <em>“There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.”</em></p>
