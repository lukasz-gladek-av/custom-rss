		<p>Ah, Let it Die. Quite possibly one of the most enigmatic free-to-play games of all time, it’s been 9 years since the original launched on PS4, where it introduced the world to Uncle Death, the Tower of Barbs and its Souls-lite hack and slash combat. It also introduced the world to the idea of paying real money to revive yourself, and while that might not have particularly caught on, the fact that it’s still going nearly a decade later shows that it got a lot of things right. Fans of the series can rejoice then, with the announcement of Let It Die: Inferno, a brand-new, full-price entry in the series that looks to take all those things that the original got right and make them better.</p>

<p>The Tower of Barbs is gone, and instead you’re about to embark on a mission into hell, descending through the different levels on the way to… well, I’m not sure yet, since Death appears at the start of the game, and it’s called Let It Die. Perhaps the things it wants you to let die are all the beasts and badniks that get in your way, and from the look of the announcement trailer, there’s going to be plenty of those to send on their way. </p>
<p>Touted as a ‘survival action roguelike’ Let It Die: Inferno is due to launch on the PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on the 3rd of December, 2025. Just like the original game, Let It Die: Inferno is being published by GungHo Online Entertainment, but where that was developed by Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture, the team at Super Trick Games, who span off from the original developers and worked on the short-lived battle royale Deathverse: Let It Die, are once again taking the reins. </p>
<p>It already looks amazing, and seems to mix the characterful combat of the original with a thoroughly modern take on the Roguelike genre, while shifting to Unreal Engine 5 and a full-price release, which should hopefully remedy many player’s number one complaint with the first game. We’ll be checking it out over the next two days at the Tokyo Game Show, and we’ll be sure to let you know how it feels!</p>

		<p>So, you know the DualSense controller? That, but Kratos. Or, in other words, take a white DualSense, put a big red stripe down one side and some nice red buttons.&nbsp;That’s all they have done really, and that makes it very annoying that I love it and want one.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War 20th Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense Controller | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Nd0CB7fiIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“In honor of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a>’s 20th anniversary this year, we were thrilled by the opportunity to celebrate this milestone with a new DualSense controller design,” said Associate Art Director Dela Longfish from Santa Monica Studio.</p>
<p>“When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo. No matter which God of War game you’re playing, the shape of his red ink against the gray of his ash-covered skin is one of the most iconic elements of Kratos’ look across both Greek and Norse sagas. Our team made sure to represent both of these key tones in the color selection for the controller to make every aspect an authentic homage to the design that has defined Kratos for over two decades. ”</p>
<p>“We hope fans enjoy the controller and can’t thank everyone enough for all of the support you’ve shown Santa Monica Studio over the years!”</p>

<p>The God of War 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense will be available in limited quantities for a eyebrow raising recommended retail price of $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders start on October 3, 2025 at 10am local time at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a> (for U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) as well as participating retailers globally.</p>
<p>There’s still a couple of months left in the year so maybe we will get something else to celebrate God of War’s 20th birthday. Maybe a look at that highly rumoured next game set in Egypt? Maybe? Please? Go on Sony.</p>
