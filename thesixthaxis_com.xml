		<p>Techland has confirmed the release date for Dying Light: The Beast. This standalone expansion-sequel to their parkour-laden zombie series will launch on 22nd August 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Kyle Crane is back, and he’s frickin’ angry, so he’s going to channel that against the undead and everyone that stands in his way.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “As we approach the tenth anniversary of the franchise, it seems fitting to be returning to the world of Dying Light. Perhaps most surprising is that The Beast is going to be available at no extra cost for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition, fulfilling the promise of a second DLC expansion for that game. Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

		<p>During Summer Games Fest, it was announced that Lies of P’s recently revealed Overture DLC had a release date. And that release date is today. That’s right, you can get the new Lies of P content right now. You can check out the new launch trailer which was shown at Summer Games Fest below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkCOWLrh26s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Lies of P Overture says, “They were waiting in the dark. Now they rise. Face fierce new bosses and carve your path through the shadows of Krat’s history. Lies of P: Overture is a brutal new expansion to the acclaimed Soulslike/Action RPG.”</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/13/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Lies of P review, Reuben said, <em>“Smooth combat, seamless exploration and a set of well-executed mechanics makes Lies of P an excellent Soulslike. When you add in the gorgeous visuals, desolate world design, stark sound design and engrossing story, it raises the experience above a lot of its contemporaries. All in all, although Lies of P is essentially Bloodborne featuring Timothée Chalamet, it does more than enough to mark itself out as a unique title worth your time – and I’m not lying.”</em></p>

		<p>Get a first look at the Torrisi Family business in this new story trailer for Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - “Loyalty is Everything” Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XLJZHw6rm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar&nbsp;<em>Mafia</em>&nbsp;gameplay,” said Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes. “That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi’s crime family.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mafia games that were set in the US, Mafia: The Old Country takes us to the very beginning of the Mafia and its base in Sicily. Enzo Favara is a brand new protagonist in the series and with the time setting, we will not see any of the characters from previous titles as most of them haven’t been born yet. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Hanger 13 has also released some developer insights that you can watch too. This video focuses on how the studio created the setting for the story of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
<p>Two editions for Mafia: The Old Country have been revealed too, and both are available to pre-order.&nbsp; These editions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Standard Edition</strong> includes the full base game and will be available for £44.99 on&nbsp; PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> lets players descend into Sicily’s criminal underworld in true Cosa Nostra style with a variety of bonus items and will be available for £54.99 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. This edition includes the Padrino Pack, featuring “Lupara Speciale” Shotgun, “Vendetti Speciale” Pistol, “Immortale” Charm, “Padrino” Outfit, “Stiletto Speciale” Knife, “Eckhart Speciale” Limousine and “Cosimo” Horse and Accessories. Additionally, it offers the Gatto Nero Pack with the “Bodeo Nero” Pistol, “Velocità” Charm, “Gatto Nero” Racing Outfit and “Carozella Nero” Race Car, plus digital bonus materials including the Original Score and Digital Artbook full of concept art and developer notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who pre-order will also get a bonus of the Soldato Pack featuring the “Soldato” Outfit, “Scannaturi Speciale” Knife, “Tesoro” Horse and Accessories and “Lupara” Charm.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8th for PS5, PC, Xbox Series XS, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now.</p>
