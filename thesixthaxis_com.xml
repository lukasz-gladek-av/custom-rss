			<p>I have to admit, I’ve got mixed feelings when it comes to the Demon Slayer franchise. I’ve never really enjoyed Shonen battle series, save for the ones I grew up with, like Naruto and Bleach. I appreciate that Demon Slayer has become a similar entry-point for countless fledgling anime fans across the world, but as someone with no real passion for the series, seeing some of my favourite animation and game studios working in the mines pumping out content for it has me feeling jaded. I’m a massive fan of the CyberConnect2 developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/04/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-review/">Naruto Ninja Storm</a> series, but it’s an interesting feeling to play a game without also having a personal attachment to the source material. I don’t feel like Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is a bad experience at all, but I also don’t know if it’s an entirely necessary or groundbreaking one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 | Pre-Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvmW5nm11ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles closely adapted the anime up to the end of its Mugen Train arc, and this sequel sees you playing through a lengthy, detailed rendition of the Red Light District and the Hashira Training arc. I’ve known the names of these arcs but very little about their content – a prologue mode is available in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 that catches you up on the events of the first game if needed, but they do so by rushing you through just six incredibly brief battles. The proper story mode, thankfully, is much more dense in detail and even activities.</p>


<p>On the label, this is another anime arena fighter. The fundamentals here haven’t changed much compared to the last game – your standard attacks are on one button, while your specials are on the other. You’ve got a meter to build up that will either let you call in an assist from your second character, swap them in entirely, have them snatch you away from an incoming attack, or bust out your current character’s ultimate attacks. It’s basic, but it’s fun, and with a beefy roster of nearly 40 characters I was pleasantly surprised by how much variety there was to each demon and demon slayer’s movesets.</p>


<p>You do so much more than just standard arena battles in the story mode, though. Your enemies aren’t always just CPU controlled versions of the playable cast, but can be unique demon beasts that only show up for the story mode, incredibly detailed multi-phase boss battles, or even hordes of enemies you tackle all at once musou-style. In-between those battles, you’ve got varied environments to explore, like quiet forest paths or the bustling Red Light district. There are side-quests to discover, rhythm mini-games to participate in, and you’ll even frequently be busting out the special abilities of your playable heroes to track down clues and hints for your next objective. I was so impressed by how much fun it was to just exist in these spaces and explore them between the main battles of the story.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel like the story mode in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 was glossing over things or skipping around. There are so many cutscenes, presenting a mix of quiet moments, silly moments, and tense hot-blooded encounters. The boss fights are full of immaculate detail, special animations, and jaw-dropping cutscenes too. This is all a staple of CyberConnect2 anime fighters, yet experiencing them in this game leaves me with a weird feeling. For the Naruto series, it felt groundbreaking to see the iconic battles of that series re-imagined with sharp 3D models, fluid animations, and massively upgraded choreography.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer is already known for being a visual feast, though – it’s the anime with arguably the most budget and most visual flashiness ever put to screen. This game perfectly matches the art style, tone, and sensory overload of those animated moments, but because of that, these flashy boss battles and anime-accurate cutscenes aren’t a massive upgrade or shocking new approach to what they’re adapting. In some cases, the anime even handles these flashy fights a bit better.</p>
<p>What the anime doesn’t have, though, is a roguelike mode. When you’re done diving through the main The Hinokami Chronicles 2, the Hashira Training mode lets you dig into randomised battles as you follow a path to victory. It isn’t nearly as varied of a mode as something like Balatro or Slay The Spire, though. Your upgrades are pretty simple and your goal is just to reach the Hashira that you’re training with to beat them so you can earn a bunch of points to use in the gallery mode. Still, it’s a pretty fun alternative to a standard Arcade mode and adds an extra layer of engagement that kept me interested in sticking with the game just a bit longer.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is an incredibly solid game. It isn’t something that has converted me into being a fan of the series, though. I also don’t think the story content contained in it does anything groundbreaking or surprisingly different compared to the source material. An existing fan of the franchise will eat this up, but you shouldn’t try to use this game as the gateway to get your friends invested in the franchise.</p>

			<p>Out of all the promising indie horror games both in the works and recently released, Heartworm stands out due to taking influence from Fatal Frame alongside the more usual Silent Hill and Resident Evil inspirations. This stems in part from the use of a camera as your main weapon, but also from the sense of unease and spectral enemies. Having enjoyed the demo last year, the full game is another stellar indie horror to add to the growing pantheon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heartworm | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-ckqEK89Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the usual viral incident or plague of horrors, Heartworm features a far more individual and internalised narrative. Sam, mourning the loss of her grandfather, is thrust into a static-filled TV in a classic ‘isekai’ story and finds herself confronting traumatic memories and environments constructed from her worst fears and insecurities. This all adds up to a horror that is concerned with trauma and grief rather than conspiracies and secretive institutions – another way in which Heartworm is far closer to Silent Hill than Resident Evil.</p>


<p>The aesthetic of Heartworm is clearly inspired by the crunchy polygons of the original PlayStation and that graphical style is absolutely perfectly suited to both the survival horror genre and the nostalgic tone of this game in particular. There is an option to activate a graphical smoother, but this feels like a betrayal of the developer’s visual intention to my eyes. Backgrounds are often atmospherically indistinct, but there is a good variety of locations from abandoned schools and hospitals to a disorientating hedge maze.</p>


<p>Sam is far from the usual survival horror protagonist. Neither a highly trained special forces operative nor a depressed divorced dad, instead she is a smart and witty character who takes incredible events in her stride but is clearly working through some difficult memories. Her hipster appearance makes her ideally suited to a game that is in and of itself a meta study of nostalgia and the toxic way in which unresolved traumas can fester and become dangerously all-consuming.</p>
<p>Your camera is the only weapon at your disposal and is used to fend off enemies, but fighting is mostly a last resort outside of boss encounters and certain foes that trap you in a ring of rocks. Instead you’ll mostly find that running from monsters is the most effective and efficient approach – theres are the traditional limitations on ammo and resources here. There is a burst mod accessory you can attach to your camera, though it feels as if more should have been included to vary your offence. When using your camera, the perspective switches to an over-the-shoulder one which makes aiming more accurate and contrasts nicely with the traditional fixed camera perspective of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The fixed camera perspective works in setting the mood and tone whilst traditional tank controls work perfectly – although modern options are available for those with an aversion to them. My only real complaint with the camera is that the view is a little too zoomed out and it can be difficult to make out what is happening at times. This was exacerbated when playing on Steam Deck; it works fin, but I found navigation easier on the larger screen, especially in some of the darker environments.</p>
<p>Exploring the various areas in the game involves the usual mixture of puzzles, locked doors, and riddles to solve. Whilst many of these are very traditional they are all well judged and offer the right amount of challenge and difficulty. Making sure that you collect all notes is essential as clues are hidden throughout them, from keywords to number combinations and even, in one memorable case, a sequence of keys to play on a piano. Navigating each zone is helped by an easily read map, which also features a welcome visual cue as to whether a room is completed, but I did find the wilderness level with its similar looking routes more difficult to navigate than the more contained urban environments.</p>

<p>The most memorable moments in Heartworm are some thrilling boss battles against horrific foes ranging from giant spiders (thankfully there is an arachnophobia toggle) and mutated deer to a nightmarish being made entirely of unspooled VHS tapes. These battles will test your reactions and movement as well as involving some puzzle elements. As resources are limited you’ll find it useful to hoard some healing items for these encounters in particular. Whilst there is a limited inventory I never found this to be an issue as items are usually picked up and used relatively close together. The exceptions here are some items that I never found a use for, which may well be linked to a secret ending.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Heartworm is another top notch indie horror to add to the collection and one that perhaps feels the closest to the games that clearly influence it. The mixture of Fatal Frame combat and Silent Hill gameplay is perfectly judged and the end result is a game that not only pays homage to the classics but deserves to be considered amongst them.	</p></div>
