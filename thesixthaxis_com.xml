		<p>Sony have teamed up with Reebok to create three special sneakers to celebrate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">thirty years of PlayStation.</a> There are three designs and all are quite tasteful, personally I’d love a pair of the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II kicks, but there is zero chance of that happening.</p>
<p>That’s because each of the three designs is exclusive to single store, in a single country.</p>


<p><br>
First up is the Reebok Workout Plus.</p>
<p>“Get fit, be fit with the stylish PlayStation | Reebok Workout Plus trainers. With two lace options, removable lacelock cable attachment, internal arch band for enhanced fit, and anniversary grey sockliners, the Workout Plus trainers are made for play.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the UK from <a href="https://www.endclothing.com/gb">End Clothing</a> from 15th October.</p>


<p>Next up is the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II.</p>
<p>“The Pump Omni Zone II are the ultimate throwback trainers. Featuring a custom pump ball styled in PlayStation colours, two lace options with metal tips, and tonnes of rad retro details, these kicks will have you balling in style, on the court or with a PlayStation controller.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the USA from <a href="https://cncpts.com/pages/new-york" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-3767a0f2-6251d66c">CNCPTS</a>&nbsp;starting 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;October.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Reebok Instapump Fury 94.</p>
<p>“Step back to where it all began. The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, and these throwback trainers pay homage to the classic console with a pump ball with “Press Play” feature, a memory card design on the tongue, and fun, hidden details in the retro design.”</p>
<p>These can only be purchased in Japan from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beams.co.jp/en/shop/j/" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-40e706b6-e9584e22">Beams</a>&nbsp;starting 24th&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>No doubt these will be expensive to purchase and if you really, really, <em>really</em> like PlayStation and Reebok <em>and</em> have more cash than Jeff Bezos then you might want to grab one of 750 limited editions box sets that contain all three designs.</p>
