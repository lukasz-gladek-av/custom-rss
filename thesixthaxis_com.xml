			<p>F1 25 is just around the corner – OK, maybe it’s a chicane or chicken – with the latest entry in Codemasters’ long-running motorsport series set to arrive on the 30th of May for PS5, XSX|S and PC. While there are improvements over last year’s entry across the board, from extensive visual updates through to new systems and features that aim to bring the digital version of the sport closer than ever to the real thing, today’s focus is on the returning Braking Point, the F1 series’ central narrative mode, that drops you into the endless drama surrounding the fictional Konnersport team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Braking Point 3 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D52QfcK9qJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A dramatic event sees the Konnersport team thrown into chaos this time around, and given the real-world drama that surrounds F1, they’ve got plenty to draw from, whether its the loss of sponsorship, drivers moving to another team, rookies nope-ing out of contracts on social media, or some wide-reaching breach of the extensive rules and regulations. Either way, things aren’t looking good at Konnersport, and you’re stepping in here to steady the ship.</p>


<p>New to this year’s entry is branching or alternative storylines, and you can decide which of the Konnersport drivers you’re going to take control of, leading to bespoke objectives for that driver, and a unique storyline conclusion. Whether that means there’s a minimum of two endings, or even more, we’re excited to find out, but it’s great to see Codemasters heaping new content into a mode that’s well-liked, but previously hasn’t had the same mileage as the others. It looks as though you’ll want to play through it multiple times to see all of the possibilities, and that’s a great option for those who tire of the long seasons or the high adrenaline and inevitable crashes of competitive online racing.</p>
<p>That’s not where the story ends though, as once you’ve finished with Braking Point you can take your driver into Driver Career or take the position as their Team Principal in My Team, making them the 11th team on the grid. I especially like this, giving the whole storyline some serious longevity and impact, and there’s also some mirroring of Brad Pitt’s forthcoming F1 movie or upcoming Cadillac team, where they will take this 11th spot.</p>


<p>While the on-screen action is at the heart of Braking Point, the team has made some welcome changes to various technical aspects of the mode, including the appearance of an all-new Hard mode to ramp up the challenge, and updating and revising the facial capture for the drivers using Nvidia’s Audio-to-Face technology through the returning interview sequences, making sure that the drama and high-tension moments look better than ever before. It’ll also benefit from all of the other improvements across the board, making it feel as though this is an essential part of the F1 25 experience.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be an amazing year for F1 storylines, and F1 25 hopes to put itself at the centre of that with Braking Point. We can’t wait to finally get our hands on it in the near future.</p>

		<p>11 bit studios has announced Frostpunk 1886, an expanded remake of the original Frostpunk. The name Frostpunk 1886 has been chosen in reference to the in game lore, when the Great Storm first hit New London. Frostpunk 1886 is going to built up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing the original up to new standards along with additional content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 will introduce new gameplay mechanics, new laws, new content, and a new Purpose path for players to wander down. Additionally, Frostpunk 1886 will have mod support too. That was not possible in the original release of Frostpunk. 11 bit studio may also consider creating new DLC for Frostpunk 1886. Frostpunk 1886 has moved into development, but it will not release until 2027. 11 bit will continue to develop both Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk Review</a></h2>
<p>In our original Frostpunk review, Jason said, <em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else. Frostpunk is a truly harrowing game in the best possible way and one that will have you steeped in the harsh reality of eternal winter for dozens of hours to come.”</em></p>

			<p>Imagine a world where Breath of the Wild was made without the financial force of Nintendo behind it. Imagine that it was made by a team more interested in Star Wars than in Lord of the Rings, and then imagine that rather than the ruins of Hyrule, it’s set in a vast, deserted alien world. The game you’re imagining is Star Overdrive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Overdrive - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMGJHsO_pR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re looking for shorthand, Star Overdrive is an indie sci-fi Breath of the Wild. There’s a place where that could be my review, but, this is not that place, so I’d better provide you with a touch more context.</p>


<p>Coming from the team at Caracal Games, and published by indie powerhouse Dear Villagers, Star Overdrive is a third-person adventure where you become Bios, a hoverboard and headphone-toting space farer who’s searching for his lost girlfriend, Nous.</p>
<p>That search takes you to the distant and mostly deserted planet of Cebete, a vast wasteland where metal ruins leer hungrily out of the sand, and the vast bones of ancient creatures lie bleached by the sun. It’s all presented in Breath of the Wild-esque cel-shaded visuals, though there’s much more wasteland here than there ever was in Hyrule. It’s definitely an attractive game, managing to do a lot with a little. The azure blue skies and sandy strata are enhanced by dust particles, gusts of wind and the gleaming rings of nearby planets, and Cebete feels like a real and solid place.</p>

<p>It iss a quiet place, though, and the one thing that Caracal Games have absolutely captured is a sense of loneliness, of yearning, and of regret as Bios searches for Nous. Many moments are accompanied by the sound of the wind, with the odd atonal note or two, but you can feel quite alone. It enhances the worry and the desperation that Bios is experiencing though, and gives a unique sense of pace that its inspiration didn’t always have.</p>

<p>Much of the storytelling is delivered via Nous’s personal logs, each tape found amongst the decaying mining drills and forgotten biodomes of an abandoned mining operation. She’s clearly strong and independent, but it’s clear that the weight of her situation is becoming increasingly clear to her.</p>
<p>Our hero doesn’t immediately seem like an ideal choice. There’s a dose of Chris Pratt’s Starlord about Bios, as he rocks a cassette player, keytar-sword and over-ear headphones, and as you explore, you’ll find a series of cassette tapes beyond Nous’s logs. These each hold a classic rock-styled anthem, and while they’re enjoyable enough, they just don’t quite fit with the overarching sound design or the image they’ve constructed for Bios.</p>
<p>Andrea Federici’s excellent soundtrack mixes Vangelis-esque synth with sweeping Satriani-styled electric guitar, and this feels perfectly in tune with the rest of the game. Stylistically, I wanted the additional musical numbers to sit somewhere between Synthwave and Metalcore – something like Gunship or Bad Omens perhaps – but I was left wanting</p>

<p>Bios’s hoverboard is his main source of transportation, and it’s one of the highlights of the game, letting you go boosting, jumping and tricking your way across the sand dunes. Your abilities are fundamentally tied to your hoverboard’s enhancements, and you can craft and build new parts for your board, making it faster, stronger and more manoeuvrable. As part of that, you’ll find a steady stream of races, time trials and collectathons that put your boarding skills to the test, and though they’re occasionally frustrating, overall they do a great job of breaking up the exploration.</p>
<p>Besides your hoverboard, you have a growing set of powers. As with other elements of Star Overdrive, these are heavily influenced by Breath of the Wild. Whether it’s a magnetic push and pull or the ability to freeze time, you have to utilise them to solve puzzles and traverse huge areas, and while they’re slavishly reminiscent of Nintendo’s green-clad hero, there’s enough cleverness and skill to make Star Overdrive feel like its own thing.</p>

<p>Not to sound like a broken record, but the Breath of the Wild comparisons become even more obvious with towers to climb to unlock the map, and shrine-like mining levels that further power up your character. The way they’re implemented may be a riff on Nintendo’s original work, but they’re done well enough that you can forgive it most of its foibles.</p>
<p>Those foibles include lacklustre combat – a chore made all the more annoying by a lack of an enemy lock-on – a few performance stutters, and a camera that is occasionally the wrong side of helpful.</p>
<p>Star Overdrive also makes a terrible habit of showing you the Game Over screen and playing a mournful few notes every time you make a mistake, when really it just means you’ve died and it’s going to reset you relatively near to where you were a moment ago. Caracal really should patch this out immediately because it’s ridiculous and silly, and the longer you play the game, the more it feels like a cruel joke.</p>
