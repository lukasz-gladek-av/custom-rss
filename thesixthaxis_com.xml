		<p>With a little less than a month to go to its previously announced date, Techland has announced that they are delaying the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> to 19th September 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-will-be-unleashed-with-an-august-release-date/">Previously expected for 22nd August</a>, the extra month will allow for extra polish.</p>


<p>In<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/516342322187731208"> the statement</a>, Techland writes:</p>
<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve been carefully listening to what you’ve been saying – whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve based on player feedback include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.</em></p>

<p><em>We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand. Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we’ve learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is.</em></p>
<p>The team promises regular updates through the now 8 weeks before launch, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Gamescom in Hall 6, so you can check out Kyle Crane’s return if you’re heading to the show.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a standalone game that grew out of the second planned DLC for Dying Light 2. Because of that, it will be available separately, of course, but is also still being released at no extra cost&nbsp;for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition. Techland have a great reputation for long support and consumer-friendly moves, and this is just another example of that.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-3">Project Cars 3</a> will be delisted in August and the servers shutdown in early 2026. This brings an end to the Project Cars franchise, with the first two titles in the series having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/24/project-cars-games-are-being-delisted-from-sale/">delisted in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on the game’s Steam page, it was announced:</p>


<p><em>Update on PROJECT CARS 3. All product sales will end on: August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC. Please note that times may vary by region. If you bought the game digitally it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future. Any DLCs purchased before August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC will still be available to use after this date. The game’s online modes will also remain active until February 24th, 2026.</em></p>
<p>While a reason for this was not given, the most likely situation is the one that affects almost all racing games, as licenses for cars, tracks and soundtracks expire. With reduced income from games several years after release, it rarely makes financial sense for companies to review the game-specific licensing deals that are cut with manufacturers and tracks.</p>
<p>The sad part of this is that it’s an end to what was a real bolt from the blue for the sim racing genre. Launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/11/project-cars-review/">Project Cars was an imperfect, but refreshingly different take</a> on the sim and simcade racer, and gained a healthy fanbase on the PS4 and Xbox One generation, two years before Gran Turismo Sport arrived, and at a time when Forza Motorsport was still a lighter style of racer. It was quickly followed up by a sequel in 2017, but then things went a little bit off the rails.</p>

<p>SMS was acquired in 2019 by Codemasters ahead of the 2020 release of Project Cars 3. That game took a turn towards more arcade racing that didn’t meet the same audience as the previous titles, and with Codemasters subsequently acquired by EA, their sim racing endeavours were eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/the-project-cars-franchise-has-been-cancelled-by-ea/">cancelled in 2022</a> and the team broken up or laid off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SMS founder Ian Bell had left and gone on to found Straight4 Studios (previously branded as Mildly Annoyed Studios). They’re currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/project-motor-racing-races-to-a-november-launch-with-an-intriguing-single-player-career/">Project Motor Racing</a>, putting even more focus on motorsports and with a November release date.</p>
<p>In our review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/24/project-cars-3-review/?cmpscreen">Project Cars 3</a>, Thomas wrote, “Project CARS 3 suffers from a case of mistaken identity. Once you adjust to the new direction, you can get into a fun flow of ticking off objectives, drifting around hairpins and purchasing upgrades. However, while the series’ existing platform means you get a great variety of circuits, cars and weather conditions, it also shackles this game from being a great arcade racing experience.”</p>

			<p>I am not a coder. In fact, I view the actual process of development and coding in much the same way as much of Hollywood with hackers being some kind of modern wizard with arcane knowledge. With that in mind, when I was offered the chance to play a game that puts you in the shoes of a hacker trying to access a sinister organisation’s network, my first worry was that I wouldn’t be able to understand what I was doing. The premise intrigued me enough that I gave it a try and I’m glad that I did, as s.p.l.i.t is up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a> in terms of short experimental horror games.</p>
<p><em><strong>Content Warning:</strong> s.p.l.i.t contains dark elements, with thematic and immersive references to self harm and suicide. I won’t discuss details in the review but these are central enough to warrant caution.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="'s.p.l.i.t' - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKO3UzOTBsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aesthetics of s.p.l.i.t are perfectly in keeping with the game. While most of the time you’ll be staring at a simulated interface, you can turn to look around your room when necessary. This will mostly be required to switch between your hacking interface and your messaging screen through which you’ll interact with two mysterious colleagues. All mechanics are carried out through the keyboard, which really nails the immersion. Messaging is performed through mashing the keys to simulate actual typing, but all of the hacking has to be done for ‘real’.</p>
<p>The backstory of s.p.l.i.t is deliberately incredibly vague. You and two accomplices are trying to hack into a system in what appears to be an authoritarian dystopia. You have access to an illegal field kit device that can be used to create an authorisation key but will only have a limited time to finish the job once you have access. This scenario, especially when combined with the sheer immersion of the interface, leads to some of the most harrowing and thrilling gameplay you’ll find in indie horror. The fact that this all revolves around using a DOS-like interface to find and access files and programs within the system makes this a game that you have to play to feel.</p>


<p>There are few guidelines in the game but the signposting is so expertly done that I never found myself lost even though I didn’t have any coding knowledge going in. As mentioned above, the main interface is much closer to a pre-Windows experience as you must navigate file structures, find information and use the hints from your colleagues to proceed. Each major breakthrough is marked by a save point and brings you closer to the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of dark themes, s.p.l.i.t is not a game with light and shade. This is a grubby and lo-fi experience that never lets up either in intensity or mood. The constant feeling of threat and surveillance makes the hour or so it takes to play through feel like an ordeal in the best possible way and both of the alternative endings offer no real optimism but both feel entirely appropriate for the game’s themes and setting.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		s.p.l.i.t is a tough game to write about, as at heart it is just a simulation of a textual file interface wrapped up in a dark and oppressive environment, but it is also so much more than that. The perfect fusion of themes and mechanics makes for an experience that is almost suffocatingly immersive and the darker aspects (although absolutely not for everyone) elevate s.p.l.i.t to be one of the most harrowing games you’ll find. Aside from the essential content warning, I’d recommend going in as blind as possible and just playing out your The Matrix and Sneakers fantasies.	</p></div>
