		<p>Genshin Impact is introducing a brand-new bloom support with Lauma, an important character in the new Nod-Krai region, as she serves as the Moonchant Envoy of the Frostmoon Scion faction. She’s also one of the most mechanically interesting characters released so far, and allows for two very distinct support playstyles depending on what team she’s in. This makes her a little trickier to build, but we’re here to help.</p>

<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Build</h3>
<p>Lauma changes up the bloom reaction and causes the cores to become lunar bloom cores. This, weirdly, doesn’t change anything at all about the reaction, unlike how Ineffa affected electro-charged. However, these new cores do generate something called Verdant Dew, which Lauma can consume with her skill to buff it, generate Moon Song, reduce enemy resistance to dendro and hydro, and then if she uses her burst, she’ll change the Moon Song into Pale Hymn. Pale Hymn allows the bloom reactions to be buffed by a portion of Lauma’s elemental mastery. That all sounds complicated, but basically you want to make the bloom reaction with Lauma, then use her skill, then burst.</p>


<p>One key thing to note here is that one of her passive talents changes her playstyle dramatically depending on the team composition. If Lauma is the only Nod-Krai character on your team, she’ll allow bloom, hyperbloom, and burgeon to crit, with a fixed rate of 15% crit rate and 100% crit damage. This stacks with Nahida’s C2, but only the crit rate. If there are two or more Nod-Krai characters, then Lauma will buff lunar-bloom damage. At present, only Lauma can do lunar-bloom damage though, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Weapon</h3>
<p>This is the simplest part of the guide. Lauma’s best weapon is her signature weapon, Nightweaver’s Looking Glass, which boosts elemental mastery by a lot, and also boosts bloom damage and lunar-bloom damage even more. However, you can use any weapon with a lot of elemental mastery with Lauma and still get a lot out of it. The best of these is the event weapon for this patch, the Blackmarrow Lantern, which does a lot of what her signature weapon does, but with lower stats.</p>

<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>While Lauma always wants elemental mastery, the specific stats you want differ with playstyle as above. If she’s the only Nod-Krai character, you’re generally going to want all elemental mastery pieces on her, albeit with a decent amount of energy recharge, usually in the 150% range. Her set for this build can be anything really, but both Gilded Dreams and Deepwood Memories are good options.</p>
<p>If she’s one of two or more Nod-Krai characters, then you’ll want to swap an elemental mastery piece out for a crit damage or crit rate piece, and you’ll want to go with the brand-new Silen Moon’s Serenade set on her. This set boosts energy recharge, and also boosts elemental mastery and lunar reactions as well, and it works off-field. This set is likely to be good throughout the region of Nod-Krai, so farming it and the other new set will serve you well anyway. With that done though, you’re ready to get out there and bloom with the best Lauma build you can find.</p>
