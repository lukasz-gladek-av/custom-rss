		<p>I certainly wasn’t expecting to have been raining in Las Vegas when I belatedly got up and turned on the replay of the Formula 1 qualifying. I’m not silly enough to get up at 4AM for this time-shifted race, so enjoyed the mixed up conditions with daylight emerging, and now I’m rather looking forward to doing the same for the race tomorrow!</p>

		<p>Bethesda has revealed the details for the Fallout 4 November patch, which adds a brand new Varmint Rifle and fixes for various issues causing crashes. However, the November patch will not bring the mod storage expansion for consoles as planned. But, console players need to be aware that when this update is released in December it will reset the mod load order, so action needs to be taken.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zKeAbOFFeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you are playing Fallout 4 on consoles and using mods, these are the steps to take to make sure your load order is not impacted.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Navigate to the Creations Menu and select the Load Order Menu by selecting the option listed at the bottom of the screen.</em></li>
<li><em>At the bottom of the Load Order Menu screen, select “Load Order Archive.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Save Load Order to Bethesda.net.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Yes” to confirm.</em></li>
<li><em>You should receive a message confirming the current load order has been saved to Bethesda.net</em></li>
<li><em>Exit the menu and allow the game to reload your data files. The game will confirm your load order has changed, indicating the process is complete!</em></li>
</ol>
<p>And here are the Fallout 4 November patch notes:</p>
