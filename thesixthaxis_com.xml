		<p>Just ahead of the Xbox Tokyo Game Show event at 11AM UK time, Forza Horizon 6 has leaked, confirming that &nbsp;the next entry in the open world racer is heading to Japan, when it launches in 2026.</p>



<p>The teaser shows a number of license plates from the locations that the series has visited in the past, before panning past some Japanese memorabilia and up to reveal Mount Fuji off in the distance.</p>
<p>The leak came from Forza’s own social media accounts, posting the teaser to Instagram almost 12 hours ago, and it’s seemingly appearing as an advert across social streams. With the cat out of the bag – the neko, if you will – it seems they’ve just left it all live.</p>
<p>No word on platform specifics just yet, but the game is definitely coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC at launch, with Xbox Play Anywhere and availability on Game Pass. Whether it’s day and date for PS5 as well, we won’t have to wait too long to find out, I suspect.</p>
