		<p>The stop-motion aesthetics of previous games by two-man dev team Talha and Jack have always been uniquely striking, with 2024’s Judero being the title that really gained critics’ and players’ attention. Judero’s take on Scottish folklore combined the handcrafted art of Jack King-Spooner with the coding prowess of Talha Kaya to produce a title that was brimming with humour and style. The duo followed this up with the fun mining game, Mashina, last year, and are now back with a Kickstarter campaign for a surreal and disturbing horror game called Abide. I had the opportunity to sit down and share a virtual coffee and conversation with the pair to find out more.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – Thanks for talking to us. I’m not used to these virtual interviews, but how are you doing?</strong></p>


<p><strong>Talha – </strong>Good, good, very excited, very anxious (all of the things) about our new game.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – How is the Kickstarter going so far?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s tracking very closely with the timelimit. Midway point we were midway, and now 64% through we’re 64% funded so it’s going to be tight. It’s different every time; there tends to be a slight flurry towards the end as people who have wishlisted it will get notifications towards the end ‘hey this is finishing’, but it’s not something I want to bank on or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Is the Kickstarter an all or nothing situation for the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s all or nothing basically. The other options are work on it part-time and get a zero-hour contract job or try getting a publisher but there’s a whole kind of smorgasbord of things that go along with that and a lot of publishers would just not consider this kind of game at all.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – That’s the problem with being actually original in a way. Also some of the more challenging aspects of the game given the current climate with titles like Horses and Vile: Exhumed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>Yeah, with both of those games it’s kind of baffling that they should be deplatformed from marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What’s your background interest in horror, Jack? I see your dissertation was on extreme horror?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It was on Kristeva’s idea of the abject and how it ties to visual media and also lots of Lacanian writing about the cinema screen.</p><p>
[Jack and I went on for quite a while about these psycho-analytical approaches to horror which I’ll spare you here!]
</p><p>I’ve always had this thing about storytelling and horror and what that says about the present culture and how it can be seen in retrospect. Violence was so in vogue with things like Saw and Hostel.&nbsp; Does this media desensitise you? Are people trying to be desensitised?</p>

<p><strong>TSA – That all tracks with the tangible nature of your art and games. It’s uncanny as it’s very unreal but also uses real handmade materials. With Judero I’m constantly moving between appreciating the beauty of the models and being repulsed by some of the more grotesque aspects. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Kickstarter highlights that you’ve consulted with clinical therapists to make sure that the difficult topics you’re including are treated correctly. This speaks to wanting to engage with horror more deeply rather than use it just as an aesthetic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I think this is a conversation to be had, an aspect of shock is the unexpected but there’s another type of shock that Abide is about, like the splash of cold water. The horror of the truth which is getting parsed through some of the conversations I’m having with psychologists who have worked with offenders and people who have been in controversial situations. Sometime being honest to these things can amplify the horror.</p><p>
[Jack and I now went on another long tangent about the history of psychology…]
</p><p>Lots of horror is just big men with knives are scary – oooh but one of the ways that Abide feels so fresh is that it has a really strong metatext that is coming through as I’m researching it and writing it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting to hear that you’re digging deeper than the basic jumpscare tropes of so much horror gaming.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I wouldn’t dismiss the importance of jumpscares though. They are an important tool and can be really interesting in the way they build up with the music and atmosphere etc.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>When it comes to the whole mechanical game design of a horror game there is a lot of stuff that is very animalistic. This whole conversation is making me think that when there is an intellectual base to it than that jumpscare can have more meaning behind it. But when you’re making the game it is just a tool, to keep the player entertained.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;TSA –</strong> <strong>I’m interested in your creative process. Do you make the models etc first or do you have the game outline in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>The game idea comes first and then the artstyle doesn’t necessarily make the game better or worse, it’s just the artstyle. There’s an interpretable element to the art – I mean, with a horror game it’s really fun to make it out of dolls because that’s a trope. Spooky dolls. When you’re making it, everything kind of feeds into itself and becomes part of the creative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>It is trickier to prototype this game because you already need a really well made and decorated house and you need the characters so there is a huge time budget for art and assets.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – This has been a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you both for taking the time to talk to me about all of this. Good luck with the Kickstarter and I can’t wait to get hands on with Abide!</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/abide?ref=discovery&amp;term=abide&amp;total_hits=72&amp;category_id=35">Kickstarter for Abide</a> runs until the 28<sup>th</sup> February with digital copies of the game being available from the £12 pledge. Speaking to Jack and Talha highlights to me just how crucial these kinds of genuine artistic approaches to gaming and horror are in a world that is becoming increasingly commodified and handed over to Generative AI. I would urge you to check out the Kickstarter and pledge if you are able.</p>

		<p>Bungie have announced that their next large update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>,&nbsp; titled Shadow and Order, has been delayed.<br>
<em><br>
“Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence</em></p>


<p><em>In terms of communications, we will be focusing on providing you with updates about our live game content, community activations, and general upkeep through the TWID and our Destiny social channels. Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will have more information on our next major update and future plans for Destiny 2 closer to launch.</em></p>
<p><em>See You Starside.”</em></p>
<p>The Shadow and Order update had been due to arrive just after the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/the-marathon-server-slam-takes-place-a-week-before-launch/">Marathon Server Slam</a> and just before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/19/marathon-gets-a-march-5th-release-date/">Marathon itself launched,</a> so it seemed inevitable that it would be moved to allow Bungie some space for that.</p>

<p>Bungie have not released a roadmap for future updates but if Shadow and Order – or whatever it gets called – is delayed by three months then there is a very good chance that the next expansion, Shattered Cycle, will also get pushed back.</p>
<p>Bungie are clearly prioritising Marathon, and they really have to as they need another big hit. Destiny 2 is a shadow(keep) of its former self, and delaying big updates for months on end is not going to incentivise the players left.</p>
