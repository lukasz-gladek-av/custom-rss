		<p>There’s an incredible looking year of games ahead of us, both in terms of what we already know about with the likes of Monster Hunter Wilds, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">GTA 6</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-3-doom-the-dark-ages/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and so, so much more… but only one game can top our list of most wanted games of 2025. That game is Ghost of Yōtei.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In anticipation of a Ghost of Tsushima sequel’s almost inevitable announcement, we were all wondering the same thing. How can Sly Cooper and inFamous creators, Sucker Punch Productions, possibly follow up on one of the most celebrated PlayStation exclusives of the past decade? By sacking off the main character, of course, jumping the game some 300 years in the future, and taking us to a completely different part of Japan. It’s so obvious!</p>


<p>Jokes aside, the change of setting makes perfect sense for Ghost of Yōtei. As much as we enjoyed Jin Sakai’s Mongol-murdering revenge quest, he wasn’t the most compelling of characters, the mantle of “Ghost” now free to pass onto another protagonist. There’s a lot we don’t know about newcomer warrior, Atsu, or what motivates her but we love the idea of telling different sagas throughout history, instead of clinging to a single storyline and its cast of characters.</p>


<p>That said, we expect Ghost of Yotei to hit many of the same beats as its predecessor in terms of gameplay, visuals, and the sequel’s approach to open world game design. The new Hokkaido setting will give us yet another gorgeous slice of feudal Japan to explore, while the 17th century timeline allowing for a new arsenal of weapons and technologies. Where the Mongols mainly fought with swords, bows, and cheap tricks, Atsu will likely encounter an array of newfangled gunpowder arms.</p>
<p>The Edo period of the 17th century contrasted with the chaotic Sengoku period that preceded it. Set in 1603, Ghost of Yōtei will be right at the time that Tokugawa Ieyasu was given the title of Shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei, settling the now unified country into a period of relative peace and stability, albeit with increasing restrictions on social heirarchy and, by 1639, a strict isolationist policy that booted almost all foreigners out of the country. Ghost of Yōtei will be just at the tipping point of this era, and it will be fascinating to see the tale that Sucker Punch tell on this backdrop – of particular note, Atsu’s status as an onna-musha, a female warrior, naturally clashes with the neo-Confucianism and the lessening and changing roles that women had more generally in this world.</p>

<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, along with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">The Last of Us Part II</a>, helped push the PS4 to its limits just month before the PS5’s arrival, we’re fascinated to see how Sucker Punch makes use of Sony’s newer console, especially the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. We’re hoping to see larger, more cinematic battles, with Hokkaido’s many beautiful vistas brought to life with stunning fidelity.</p>
<p>For now, we still know very little about the game apart from its 2025 release window. If there’s one request we’d like to highlight on our wishlist, it’s the return of Legends, the fantastic online co-op mode that kept us coming back to Ghost of Tsushima long after the original credits rolled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-kingdom-come-dynasty-warriors-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been starting 2025 with a bout of flu – thanks, 2025 – but on the plus side that’s meant I’ve been tucked up in bed with my ROG Ally, Balatro, and the end of Metaphor ReFantazio. These are all good things. Other than that, I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> (Microsoft’s cloud streaming for this is impeccable), some Kingdom Come: Deliverance to see what it’s all about, and a tiny bit of Marvel Rivals too. Life could be worse, in other words.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? <strong>Aran</strong> played Space Marine, the first one, as it’s been in his backlog forever. He told us, “It’s a nice throwback to the PS3 and 360 era of third-person shooters with obvious heavy influence from Gears of War. I was also surprised to see that the online was still quite active. I’ve also been playing more Witcher 3 and have just landed on Skellige.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been hopelessly glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> which he says is easily the best game in the series to date. Giving us some detail, he said, “After the mess that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">DW9</a> I honestly didn’t have much hope for the series, but somehow Omega Force has managed the impossible. Although there was a cathartic joy in mindlessly hammering out button combos, Origins offers a genuine test of skill and a wealth of content I’m actually eager to explore and replay. Hopefully its glowing critical reception will translate into commercial success, cementing a sequel, and an “Origins” style shake-up for Samurai Warriors.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the System Shock remake, which he says “could have done with a bit more remaking, I get it’s a classic game but it just feels so dated.” He hasn’t really enjoyed much gaming this week, to be honest, saying, “I also played The Stanley Parable and I am going to be a grumpy old man and say I didn’t think much of it at all, the narrator started getting on my tits mansplaining everything. I also played Suicide Squad (spot the theme here?) which I didn’t get past the Shark guy tutorial because it was so fricking dull, it felt like someone had tried to make Destiny by committee. I also played the new Destiny 2 episode which wasn’t particularly great either. I do have LEGO Horizon sat on my table so I’m hoping that will save the week.” Let us know if it’s saved the day TC!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for review next month, Cuisineer also for review, and a bit of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer for not review. That’s not all, but much like TC, the further gaming hasn’t been all that enjoyable – “I’ve also been playing Veilguard, which is about fifteen layers of disappointment. It feels shallow, dialogue is poor, a main character’s voice can’t pull off the role, I can’t explore during actual missions without hitting twenty dead ends I have to come back to later. The only thing it almost excels at is graphics, but even then the generic aesthetic where even Qunari don’t look particularly alien anymore is just shite.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has only been playing Marvel Rivals, hammering away at the season pass and getting reasonably good with Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon. He says, “I’m loving the new additions to the game with Season 1 and looking forward to seeing what the second half of the season brings.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through the first Gears of War on Series S (360 rather than remaster) as he fancied actually playing the series through (previously only played the remaster of 1 on PC). What did he think? “It was fun but hasn’t aged that well. Started the second one now which feels like a pretty big leap forwards. I’ve reinstalled Another Crab’s Treasure after getting distracted and completely forgetting what I was doing in it and it is still one of the best Souls-likes out there. Not resorted to using the gun yet but leaving it open as an option if I get super stuck. Picked up Blade Chimera on Steam (cheaper if you already own Bloodstained) as that’s been on my radar for a long while.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>. He dabbled with a little bit of the original Space Marine, similar to Aran dragging it out of his backlog, stomped through the opening level of RoboCop: Rogue City (which he previously played for preview), and played something secret and shadowy that he’ll talk about next week. He’s also just about to start playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> and a roguelike Tetris kind of thing called Drop Duchy.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>
