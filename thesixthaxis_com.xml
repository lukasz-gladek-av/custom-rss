		<p>Romeo is a Dead Man has been revealed as the next game from Grasshopper Manufacture, Suda51 and Ben Yamazaki.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romeo is a Dead Man - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game starts out weird, and just continues to get weirder. Answering the door and getting absolutely blasted in the face, Romeo’s life is saved by his pal shoving the Dead Gear Life Support System into his eye… and turning him all cyborg-y.</p>
<p>What happens next is Romeo Stargazer going on a journey across spacetime, tracking down wanted criminals and turning them into a bloody mess using a mixture of swords and guns.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, and we’ll note other platforms as and when they are confirmed.</p>

<p>Suda51’s last game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a>, of which Nick said, “No More Heroes 3 shines with its fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, zany characters and stunningly slick combat. It’s not afraid to be what it is, Suda 51 and his team delivering a great instalment to the franchise that welcomes us to the Garden of Insanity.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/capcoms-pragmata-is-coming-out-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Capcom has released a brand new trailer for its PS5 exclusive sci-fi title Pragmata, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">which was first announced in 2020</a>, and confirmed that it will release in 2026. The game was first meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. Anyway, here is a brand new trailer featuring the little girl who we now know is an android called DI02367 or Diana for short, who wields a big gun.</p><div>
<p>We’re still pretty much none-the-wiser what Pragmata is really all about, but that naturally adds to its allure. We do know it will be an action adventure game that mixes in some strategy too. We will have to wait until later to really know what Pragmata is all about.</p>

		<p>Developer METROPOLICE has announced a brand new city builder called The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, where you become the Governor of Hell. You are in charge of putting together your own version of the punishment focused underworld, sorting out the souls that find themselves there while also trying to work out all of the secrets of Hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="new trailer 6" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQdvpF1xjbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Our goal with The HELL: City Builder of the Dead is to bring a fresh perspective to the city-builder genre—by exploring a theme that’s rarely touched,”</em> said Mike Chong, Founder of METROPOLICE. <em>“This is our imagination at play. Players step into the role of a Hell Governor, managing a dark, chaotic vision of the afterlife that also has a giant Titan lurking around the map that the player needs to defeat to advance.”</em></p>
<p>In The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, you will need to manage a delicate balance by managing the arrivals. Fail to do so and these sinners may attempt to cause chaos to destroy everything. In addition to the sinners, there are the Titans that rule each of the realms of Hell. Each of the Titans is inspired by various mythologies and to fully uncover the secrets of Hell you will need to defeat the Titans.</p>

<p>The Hell: City Builder of the Dead will enter Steam Early Access on Friday, October 24, 2025.</p>
