<p>In our Tunic review, Steve said,<em> “Tunic had a lot to live up to after years of built up expectation, and it doesn’t just meet them, it shatters them and stands out as one of the most joyous gaming experiences I’ve had in years. It takes a little while to feel at home in Tunic’s gorgeously rendered world, but once it clicks and the secrets of the masterfully constructed in-game manual start to reveal themselves, the resulting game is up there with the likes of Zelda in terms of exploration and discoveries.”</em></p>
