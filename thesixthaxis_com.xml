		<p>A The Horizon TV show was revealed by Sony in an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/27/gran-turismo-god-of-war-and-horizon-tv-shows-announced-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor briefing </a>in April 2022 and later on it was revealed that the show would be heading to Netflix. However,&nbsp; Steve Blackman, the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy and the Horizon series, was accused of “toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behaviour”, claims that he denied, and the Horizon series was cancelled.</p>
<p>In January this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Sony announced that a movie based</a> on the franchise was in the works at Columbia, the studio that made the Uncharted and Gran Turismo movies</p>


<p>Thanks to documents released as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">Sony’s ongoing battle with Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, we now know that a Horizon movie is moving forward and could be on the big screens by 2027.&nbsp; The document reveals that Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions has stated that they already have a script and are looking for a director, with filming taking place next year.</p>
<p>A Horizon television show always seemed implausible as almost everything would have to be CGI, including the many robot creatures, and that would be very expensive. A movie will have a bigger budget and can focus on a smaller part of the Horizon mythology.&nbsp; Personally, I would like a story set right at the start of the mythology as the human race races to save itself, but ultimately becomes food for the self-replicating robots they created.</p>
<p>Sony also has a Helldivers movie on the cards, but no details have been revealed for that project.&nbsp; A sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced in 2024 and in December of that year producer Charles Roven said that a script was in place.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be the rather busy Tom Holland who spent this year filming Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey and is currently zipping around in spandex filming Spider-Man: Brand New Day.&nbsp; After that, he’s got American Speed on schedule, will Uncharted film after that?</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it has, for the first time, signed a deal with football’s governing body FIFA, and this will have an impact on international management in Football Manager 26 and beyond. This includes adding the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women’s World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to the game at a later date as part of a international management content update due next year.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, <em>“Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio.Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we’re delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”</em></p>


<p>This partnership means in Football Manager 26 all of the teams taking part in the 2026 World Cup will have their official kits in the game. Further details are to follow at a later date about what else this partnership and the international management update will bring when it launches in 2026. Football Manager 26 is due to release on November 4th.</p>
