			<p>The bean bag is a stone-cold classic. Filling professional lofts, student flats and playrooms since the 1960s, it’s a universal piece of lo-fi design, that was more or less perfected the first time out. That said, modern companies like <a href="https://www.bigberthaoriginal.com/">Big Bertha</a> have seen that there’s clear room for improvements, nipping and tucking the classic bean bag into new, more contemporary forms, with modern, harder-wearing fabrics and updated ‘beans’. What that amounts to, in the Big Bertha Ultra Lux Gaming Chair, is a bean bag that’s comfortable, can take some punishment, and is perfect for the longest gaming sessions you can muster.</p>
<p>To be sure we understand each other, bean bags are not full of beans of the baked, broad or green variety, and nor are they made from plastic or paper bags. The Ultra Lux is a fabric bean bag with an additional fabric chair back built into it, with the beans moving freely between the two and sculpting to your body when you settle down into it. Because it moulds to your body as you sit down it’s incredibly comfortable, and the extra structure of the chair back means that you’re also really well supported in a way I’ve not experienced from a bean bag before.</p>



<p>Our review chair came in grey cord, which, purely by luck, matched our sofa perfectly. If you happen to have bought a cord sofa in the past five years or so – there’s a good chance you’ve been to DFS at some point – you’ll know how soft and hard-wearing the fabric is, and through our testing it stood up to plenty of punishment, as well as the requisite popcorn and biscuit crumbs that any seat manages to accumulate, even when you haven’t eaten anything.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s stain resistant if you do have a food or drink based snafu, and refillable if someone manages to make their way through the dual zips – during our testing these thankfully stopped the inside beans becoming outside beans. The beans themselves are made from SupremeX polystyrene, which is designed to last longer and be more durable than competitors offerings, and through our time with the Ultra Lux, we’ve not noticed any noticeable loss of bean density, or the bag – in essence – deflating, so they appear to be doing exactly what they’re designed for.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I’ve had with the Ultra Lux is that I struggle to get into it. Not because I lack the flexibility to sit closer to the floor, but because my 8 year-old has claimed it as his own. For someone much smaller than myself it literally turns into a nest, and he’s generally found secured within it with Lego City on the TV and an iPad in hand looking far too pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Seriously, it’s almost upsetting how pleased with himself he is, and I have to be faster than an 8 year-old if I want to take my turn in the chair. Luckily, he goes to school and I get to stay at home some days, so the joke’s on him. Thanks to the headrest, it’s ideal for a sneaky midday nap, which I absolutely don’t do because I am consistently working hard.</p>
<p>While our review unit was grey, there’s a whole range of different colours and a choice of alternate fabrics to wrap your beans up in. The Aegean Blue colour that they use in a lot of their advertising looks particularly good, and I’m already thinking of picking up a second one for a different room.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ultra Lux, or indeed any of the Big Bertha bags, is that they don’t cost very much. You can currently pick one up direct from the Big Bertha website for £109.90, and I think that’s phenomenal value, particularly for the build quality and extreme comfort you’re going to experience for a very long time.</p>

				<p>Summary</p><p>
				If you're looking for a cost-effective and hugely comfortable gaming chair, it's well worth thinking about an Ultra Lux bean bag from Big Bertha. Not only are they a fraction of the price, unlike traditional gaming chairs, they're light enough to move around your home too. 			</p></div>

		<p>Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine have announced that their realistic modern warfare tactical game Broken Arrow is coming out on 19th June. A deluxe Vanguard Edition is also available for pre-order on Steam, giving three days early unlock from 16th June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Broken Arrow, named after US military term for an accidental nuclear weapon event that does not create a risk of war, and not after the 1996 John Travolta film, sees fictional conflict between US and Russian militaries in the Baltic region. Players will command infantry, recon, support vehicles, aircraft and more in a battle for supremacy through a single player campaign and 5v5 online multiplayer. You’re not building up a base in battle, but are instead looking to capture and hold strategic points and calling in reinforcements from off-map.</p>
<p>While it has the appearance of a hard-nosed military simulator, Steel Balalaika aims to be accessible to both newcomers and RTS experts. A key hook is the army-building system that allows for unit customisation using the more-than-300 realistic military units.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game through early playtesting, and there’s certainly a lot to take in. “While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game,” I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow preview</a>, “there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.”</p>

			<p>Put thoughts of the John Travolta and Christian Slater film to one side, as outside of the name referring to nuclear weapons going missing, Broken Arrow is not related in any way. Instead this is a tactical modern era wargame looking to take on the RTS niche when it launches in June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For our hands on time with Broken Arrow, we jumped right in at the deep end, playing multiplayer with a bunch of far more experienced players who had already sunk hours and hours into the game. In a way, this was actually the best way for a newcomer to see how the game works, with a 5v5 tussle for control over objectives spread across the map. Going toe-to-toe with players that have already figured out the ins and outs of how the game works wasn’t going to go well, so instead I was able to focus on smaller, less pivotal control points, while soaking in the action going on elsewhere.</p>


<p>Broken Arrow emphasises the more tactical aspects of warfare. There’s no base building here, but you do all bring your units out from set spawn points, having them race across the map in the early parts of battle to try and quickly establish frontlines and defensive positions with as many of the map’s control points in your hands as possible.</p>
<p>Units are broken down into six categories, with speedy recon units, infantry, tanks, support, artillery and air, drawing from the two sides of this particular war – the US and Russia. However, there’s a lot of crossover between these categories. Just summoning a squad of soldier is going to be pretty useless when it then takes them 15 minutes to sprint from one side of the map to even the closest objective, so you typically want to spawn them within an armoured transport to get them closer to where they need to go, or a helicopter, if the risk of being shot down is worth the reward of the amount of time you save.</p>


<p>And that risk is very real. Even from the opening moments, fighter jets start zipping across the map to deal quick missile strikes on advancing tanks, then countered by surface-to-air missiles that see them spew decoy flares to try and make an escape. Once that SAM has fired, it’s then in a known spot, which makes it a ripe target for artillery and surface missile fire, which in turns reveals fresh targets for fighter jets. Each time you peel back the fog of war to fire off a barrage, it brings the risk of a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use that fog of war to your advantage. I spent the latter stages of my first battle building up an infantry assault force, moving them through the woods and holding station until the final minutes of the battle, where I could rush a lightly defended control point (alongside a rather danger close missile strike) and capture it right with minimal risk of reprisals.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this for my second match, on a more watery map with an out-of-the-way control point, I then started to put my soldiers in choppers to avoid slower submersible vehicles being spotted and blown up, had a SAM for cover, and spread out soldiers with IGLA launchers handy to then hold the control point from any aerial assaults.</p>
<p>This was all for nought as the battle in the middle of the map went the other team’s way, and my efforts to push back onto the mainland docks were quickly rebuffed by a handful of defending units tucked up in buildings and woodland. Multiplayer battle play out through three phases, with points awarded for area control as well as casualties.</p>

<p>A much better way to get a handle on the game is to go through the initial training and single player missions, though. We had access to a pair of scenarios, one from each side, with an airbase assault and a mission to capture and hold a power station.</p>
<p>Both of them really highlight the need for good scouting and situational awareness. The runway capture mission starts with sending in airstrikes to clear air defences before paratroopers come in to secure a beachhead, but they quickly need airlifted reinforcements to stave off the counter attacks from bases further away on the map. The power station assault puts you more in the middle of a combined assault, giving you a handful of key units in a wider front and objectives that are built up with multiple buildings to provide great cover to tank-busting infantry, while the enemy counter offensives alternate between the two. It starts to get hairy as long range artillery comes to battery your positions and the tide gradually turns the screws against you through the mission.</p>
<p>While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game, there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.</p>
