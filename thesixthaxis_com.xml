<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s free trial weekend includes access to the season 2 features, adding Ibiza as another location to drive around in, as well as Hong Kong. Though to get to Ibiza, players will need to reach level 12, as well as side with either the Sharps or the Streets clans. Ibiza also adds new cars, alongside the roster of cars available in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown released in September, and met with middling reviews due to a number of issues. Since then, KT Racing has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/">sought to fix the issues</a> that players had concerns about, including the suspension on cars, AI behaviours, and more support for various racing wheels. In our review of the game, Stefan said, <em>“After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</em></p>
