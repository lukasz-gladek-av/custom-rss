			<p>With the Barbarians knocking at the gates, I’m sure that the Romans despaired at their lack of foresight in not building their great cities on wheels. Had they done that? Well, they could just roll off into the distance and away from those that menaced them. That’s pretty much the plan in Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road, with the world beset by hordes of shadowy creatures and the distant promise of sanctuary at the Arch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Right from the opening moments, it’s clear that Rock and Road is a fun mash-‘em-up of roguelite, bullet heaven and tower defence. You start with the core building of your city, trundling downwards toward safety as monsters spawn around you, and a black fog follows. As the hero peon, you have to scurry around nearby, gathering wood, stone and gold while also chipping in with some of the defensive effort.</p>


<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, those resources don’t actually pay for city upgrades and new buildings in the moment. Wood increases the speed of your towers firing, stone repairs damage, and gold can be spent on buildings and upgrades at safe zones, but the main way you’ll earn buildings is through levelling up and getting a choice of three buildings to place. That comes from gathering the experience gems dropped by fallen monsters and levelling up.</p>


<p>There’s more of the Vampire Survivors structure and gameplay feel to this game than it appears on the surface. Your hero also controls in that bullet heaven fashion, so you just move them around and they’ll automatically attack nearby enemies and harvest from scenery that you push them into, gathering a long snake of resources that you need to then lead back and deposit at your city. That’s the point that everything is banked, often levelling you up in a single go early on, and kicking you into the building screen.</p>
<p>This is where it starts to feel like tower defence. Your city sits in the centre of a square grid, and you can build out from that point. Each building takes up just a single square, and doesn’t have to be adjacent to another building, just in line with one, so you can immediately start to strategise with your building placement. Shorter-ranged turrets can go to the edges, longer-ranged mortars and ballistae more centrally, and then minion generators, stat farms and special buffing buildings nearby. Given the direction of travel, it’s easy to load up the rear of your city, but that can hurt you when waves of enemies spawn from the front and sides, so you do often need a multi-sided approach. I’ve repeatedly leant into having a skinny column, which helps with the need to clear scenery that your city can get stuck on and be vulnerable.</p>

<p>You can get adjacency bonuses –&nbsp;there’s a really helpful +50% damage building that wants to be central to a bunch of towers, while stat farms give 5% boosts by default and an additional +1% for each one in a chain. It’s fun trying to get boosts and synergies to work together, like leaning in on having minions and then a turret that gains 10% damage for every minion currently alive, or a building that makes fire deal 50% bonus damage to frozen enemies.</p>
<p>In a typical roguelite fashion, you need to roll with what the game randomly offers you. You pick from 10 cities to start with, and that can bring some fundamental changes –&nbsp;a left-to-right mirror city that doubles your buildings, a city where XP comes from harvesting not enemies –&nbsp;and Hard difficulty on each biome starts to add further challenges, so you might have an initial plan, but if the unlocks given to you are all for fire and ice, instead of minions or gold generation, and you don’t have the cash to re-roll the options then you’ll have to pivot. The handful of safe zone checkpoints also give you a chance to adjust or enhance without pressure, giving you a choice of new weapons for your hero, a chance to get a stash of resources and the shop to sink all of your cash into.</p>
<p>The overarching progression naturally brings you new cities to play with (luring you into these different playstyles), and unlocks more buildings that broadens the options you might be presented. Even if you fail, each run also generates overarching progression points, largely depending on how far you’ve travelled, which you then spend to give percentage boosts to various city and hero traits. Success, however, immortalises that first city in the Arch, piecing together a new sanctuary and giving a little script about each one’s method.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciate about Rock and Road is how bitesized each run can be, coming in at under 30 minutes, with the spaces between checkpoints ramping up the pressure and building up to a randomised Kaiju-sized boss. They’ll generally just walk around your city alongside throngs of other enemies, while you scamper around and try to undo their abilities. One can make itself invulnerable by attaching to scenery that you need to destroy, another is a big spider queen where you need to race to destroy globs of enemies they spawn, and more.</p>
<p>Should you defeat them, it’s then a straight run to safety, and there’s a lot of joy to seeing the mass of arrows coming down from the Arch’s defensive walls, while your city fends off the chasing horde. But then that’s the end. You don’t roll through to the next biome and even greater challenges; your city is consigned to history and you start a new run. That makes it feel like you’ve seen all that the game has to offer by the time you’ve bested the standard difficulty – which I’d say isn’t that great a challenge. Playing on Hard is a big leap and requires that progression grind and more experimentation, but I feel this as a more casual option, compared to the more compulsive roguelites out there.</p>

			<p>If we rated things based solely on looks, the Gioteck WX5+ would immediately score top marks. This wireless controller for Switch, Switch 2 and PC boasts Hall Effect sticks and triggers and a pair of pro back buttons, but it’s the visual design that immediately grabs you. The delightful ‘Crayons’ livery is tied to RGB lighting, making this one of the most visually appealing controllers we’ve seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>At £24.99, Gioteck has also made one of the cheapest wireless controllers out there, especially considering all the features that Gioteck have crammed in. In terms of value, you’re simply not getting Hall Effect, programmable back buttons, RGB, a 3.5mm headphone socket, gyro and vibration anywhere else at this price point.</p>
<p>That budget pricing isn’t even immediately obvious when you pick it up. It is quite light in the hand, but the plastic that’s been used feels solid, and the textured grips help to keep it set in place.</p>



<p>While the Crayons livery is my personal favourite – who doesn’t want their controller to look like melted cake? – the other options are equally eye-catching, especially the 60s-flavoured Spiral and the multi-coloured mess of Doodle. If you’re a more serious type – or a teenage boy – there’s Dark Camo which is much more understated. There’s probably more chance of losing it, though.</p>

<p>Each of the analogue sticks houses colourful RGB rings as well, but it’s the performance of these Hall Effect sticks that’s most impactful. They’re pleasingly taut, returning to centre with a reassuring certainty, and they feel excellent in use. The Hall Effect tech should also mean that they are exceedingly long-lasting, outperforming standard potentiometer-equipped controllers that are more likely to suffer from stick drift.</p>

<p>The triggers are also Hall Effect, meaning that they’re a touch more accurate, while also benefiting from the frictionless tech. You can also switch them between analogue and digital performance, potentially cutting out a few more milliseconds of reaction time when playing shooters and other competitive titles, even without physical lockouts, which are ultimately the only thing the WX5+ is really missing. If you’re playing on Switch or Switch 2, the whole analogue trigger thing will be lost on you, but in a multi-platform house it’s a nice thing to have.</p>
<p>The only component that I’m not entirely sold on here is the cross-shaped D-pad. It feels too large under your thumb, and the left and right response feels slightly different. It didn’t cause any problems while playing, but there’s something about it that doesn’t feel as well-made as the rest of the WX5+. The other face buttons, and the shoulder buttons too, are reliable and responsive, and it’s just a bit odd that the D-pad feels as different as it does.</p>

<p>Around the back of the controller, there’s two programmable ‘pro’ buttons. These sit well under your middle fingers when you’re naturally gripping the controller, but with enough resistance to ensure you don’t accidentally activate them when you’re getting increasingly frustrated with purple shells ruining your peerless driving in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>The Gioteck WX5+ is practically a no-brainer in a household that’s looking for a great-value second controller, and it even makes a compelling cost-effective argument against the official Switch 2 Pro Controller as a daily driver. In the hand, there is an obvious difference in terms of quality, particularly in the plastics used, but when you’re in the midst of the action, the WX5+ is a deeply reliable performer.</p>
