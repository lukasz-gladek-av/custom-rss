		<p>Nintendo has revealed everything that will feature in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and confirmed that it will launch on 26th March 2026.</p>

<p>Continuing their trend of making their game titles ludicrously long, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park” will arrive with a bunch of added content for the hit 2D platformer.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Starting with Bellabel Park, there’s two main plazas to explore with different gameplay offerings. The local multiplayer plaza features 17 co-op and competitive multiplayer games to try out, with up to four players able to take part, whether on a single console or through GameShare. The Game Room Plaza takes things even further with online and local wireless play and six different attractions. These are more ghost races, with up to eight players locally and twelve online.</p>

<p>The Toad Brigade is also found in Bellabel Park at Camp Central, giving you challenges to revisit the main adventure and, for example, race to collect all the coins in a level before time runs out. These can be played in 4 player co-op on one console. You’ll earn patches and rank up as you complete more challenges.</p>
<p>But there’s more! The Koopalings have returned and stolen the Bellabel flowers, spreading them across the Flower Kingdom and forcing you to go, track down the Koopalings and fight them.</p>
<p>Joining the platforming adventure is Rosalina for the first time, playable in both the main game and through Bellabel Park. Luma is also here, as a second player co-player, able to fly around, collect coins and spin attack at enemies – you can also use mouse controls for this. That’s alongside a new assist mode, which will stop you from taking damage and give you a propeller flower if you fall down a pit.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty significant expansion for the game, that’s for sure, and can be bought physically as a new release, or digitally with an upgrade available for existing owners.</p>
<p>I loved it with its original release. giving it a massive &lt;a href=”https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/”&gt;9/10&lt;/a&gt;, and saying, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder puts a fresh new spin on the classic Mario side-scroller with wild and trippy level transformations. It’s still Mario at its core, but it’s fun not knowing what to expect from each level. This could be the start of a bright new era for 2D Mario games.”</p>

		<p>Nacon and Spiders have confirmed the full release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, the game exiting early access and launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWuflAxciDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay overview trailer runs through how the game has been designed, with a rich narrative to weave around your character, who has been ripped from the new world and taken back to the old, the companions that you can recruit, a look at the combat, and the blend of weapon and magical combat.</p>
<p>A good chunk of this is rather different to the original. GreedFall: The Dying World is a prequel to the first game, casting you as a Teer Fradee native, seeing how the colonial invaders are weaselling their corrupting ways into the land, before being whisked away from your home. A major difference is with the combat, which changes from an action RPG approach to the tactical pause style.</p>

<p>We recently had the chance to go hands on with an updated version of the game, and Steve came away much more intrigued than with his first attempt. He said, “All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.”</p>
