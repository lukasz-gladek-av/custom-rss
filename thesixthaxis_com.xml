		<p>If you’re not up to speed on Hollow Knight: Silksong, here’s the short version. It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-silksong-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch/">announced in February 2019</a>, but then updates were few and far between until a new trailer was revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed/">officially delayed in May 2023</a>, and then in April 2025 it appeared in a sizzle reel for Nintendo with a 2025 release date.</p>
<p>However, the lack of communication and six-year (and counting) development time has led fans to joke that the game will never come out.&nbsp; A playable demo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-at-the-xbox-gamescom-booth-this-year/">should be on the floor</a> at Gamescom 2025 starting tomorrow, but as there was a playable demo in 2019 that doesn’t mean much to the fans.</p>


<p>In a massive tease, Team Cherry have now posted a video that will launch a “Special Announcement” for the game at 3.30pm on 21st August.&nbsp; The internet has responded in the only way possible by suggesting that the big announcement is that the game is cancelled.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was scheduled to come to PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, and Xbox, and was also meant to be a Day One launch on Game Pass. However, some of those details are now years old so things may have changed since then.</p>

<p>Here’s a little more about the game, but again, this is from previous announcements so may not be accurate.</p>
<p><em>Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world. She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.</em></p>
<p><em>Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She’ll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom’s challenges. Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights – Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!</em></p>
<p><em>The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score. In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.</em></p>
