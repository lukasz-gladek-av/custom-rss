		<p>Creepy Jar has released new footage of StarRupture with ten minutes that shows off the world as well as some gameplay from the latest build. The video acts as a tour of Arcadia-7 showing off the inviting looking environment that holds lots of perils and dangers to be aware of. Players will have to get familiar with those dangers pretty quickly while base building.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture: The World of Arcadia-7 Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srtUwMGwCuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days. If you are interested in StarRupture you will have to wait a little bit longer to get hands on with it. Creepy Jar has confirmed that StarRupture will be coming to Steam Early Access in the autumn.</p>

<p>Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and in our review Steve said, <em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>
