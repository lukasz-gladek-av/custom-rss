		<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODkzMTgwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTM2NjA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJDMzlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.I9EjU4x5-ZG-gThi468SKf5IF8l5lg2jKLB9q7K5vyM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg report</a> on the state of Warner Bros. Games has claimed that Rocksteady is back to working on a single-player Batman game, while the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith was rebooted last year after a change of directors.</p>
<p>The report looks into Warner Bros. Games following <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">the departure of CEO David Haddad at the end of January</a>, with the games division having to writedown $300 million through 2024.</p>


<p>If there’s a silver lining for any gamers to Warner having a terrible year, it’s that Rocksteady is reportedly back to working on single-player games and on Batman specifically.</p>
<p>“Rocksteady is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game, but according to people familiar with the timeline, the new project is years away from landing,” Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier writes.</p>
<p>On Wonder Woman, Schreier said, “One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market.”</p>

<p>This would be a major disappointment from a well-regarded team. Monolith developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/10/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review/">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review/">Shadow of War</a>, pioneering the Nemesis system through the open world adventures. Shadow of War launched in 2017, but it wasn’t until <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">December 2021 that the Wonder Woman game was announced</a>, and with if the project has been rebooted, wiping out years of progress, it could conceivably still be almost a decade between their games.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s looking to be a lean few years for Warner Bros. Games, following on from a disastrous 2024 that saw the flopped launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">soon-to-be-shut-down MultiVersus</a> – a huge fall off from the heights of 2023 with Hogwarts Legacy leading the way and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>With most of its main studios having released a game within the last couple years, having Wonder Woman’s development being rebooted would mean the slate is pretty much clear for a good while. A new Lego game from TT Games, a Hogwarts Legacy sequel from Avalanche, and a new fighting game from NetherRealm are all likely to be a few years away as well.</p>
<p>A difficult time, but hopefully WB can weather the slow years ahead.</p>
