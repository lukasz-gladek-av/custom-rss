		<p>It is the start of a new year which means one thing! That thing is the annual ceremony of an NBA 2K servers being switched off. From now on, January 1st 2026, all online functionality for NBA 2K24 has been switched off. That means no more multiplayer, MyCareer or MyTeam but modes that don’t require an internet connection like MyNBA and Play Now are still playable. NBA 2K24 was released on September 8th, 2023 and was removed from sale in October 2025.</p>

<p>NBA 2K’s support page states, <em>“As of January 1, 2026, you’ll no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing. We thank you for being a part of our community and hope you continue to enjoy&nbsp;NBA 2K!”</em></p>

<p>In our NBA 2K24 review I wrote, <em>“Regardless of what this review says, NBA 2K24 will sell millions of copies, and generate millions of dollars through VC. That is because basketball fans who want to play a basketball game have nowhere else to go. The on court action is really good, but without competition to keep them honest, 2K’s monetisation has got out of hand and made modes like MyCareer near unplayable without extra investment from players.”</em></p>

		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Once more around the Sun we go, starting a fresh circuit from this fairly arbitrary starting line. It’s a time that many of us pick to be a symbolic fresh start, to tackle the upcoming twelve months with a renewed vim, vigour and determination that it’s going to be “my year”. Will it be? I certainly hope so!</p>
<p>Looking back on the video games of 2025, and had a pretty great year of play, didn’t we? There were plenty of pleasant surprises in the first half of the year, from the brilliant and unique puzzling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/blue-prince-review/">Blue Prince</a> to the incredible&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which easily stood shoulder to shoulder with much bigger budget games and immediately became a Game of the Year contender.</p>



<p>But then there was all the build up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo had remained rather tight-lipped over the successor to the sensationally popular Nintendo Switch, finally revealing the Switch 2 in January to be a….. well, another Switch-style console. By the time they revealed the launch line up and pricing, the general sentiment was muted at best. Could a new Mario Kart, some upgraded Zelda games and the Joy-Con now having a mouse mode <em>really</em> propel this to success? Turns out, yes, it really could! The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/the-switch-2-sold-over-10-million-consoles-in-just-4-months/">Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling console in history</a> through its opening months, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> has been hugely popular, and there’s been enough upgrades and fresh ports of games (once again getting a surprising amount of performance from modest specs) to keep us interested.</p>


<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">GTA 6 facing a delay to next year</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">twice</a>!), the back half of 2025 opened up to the battle of the first person shooters. Within quick succession, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> arrived to grab the attention of long-suffering Battlefield fans and disaffected Call of Duty players alike – which was only strengthened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">Black Ops 7</a> did arrive to prove everyone’s fears about the campaign true. Sandwiched in the middle was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a>, arriving with a wave of interest in the best-looking example of the extraction shooter yet.</p>
<p>But there was still plenty of space for&nbsp;quirky indie titles, like the thoroughly silly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a>, long-awaited indie sequels getting surprise releases in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>While these were all highlights, 2025 still felt like a real struggle for many. As featured in our yearly Biggest Disappointment award, the wash of redundancies, game cancellations and studio closures continued, and while thankfully not to quite the same extent as in 2024, it still saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. gutting a bunch of their studios</a> (it’s got to the point that Netflix considers them worthless in their company takeover bid), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Microsoft closing down The Initiative and cancelling Perfect Dark, Everwild and ending support of Forza Motorsport</a>.</p>
<p>On to 2026 and… well, it could be a great year for games. Will we actually see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> released this year? Who knows, but I’d put money on Insomniac meeting their launch target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/wolverine-ps5-trailer/">Wolverine</a>, there’s firmer release dates for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, and plenty more besides. We’ll be featuring all of these and more in our Most Wanted list.</p>

<p>You don’t have to dig too deeply to find spreading diseases lurking behind the surface. Generative AI has helped to feed the fire of some of the layoffs in the last couple of years, and there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">the looming buyout of EA by the Saudi PIF</a> which is banking on this to enable a restructuring plan.&nbsp;The obsession with generative AI is also now sucking up all the world’s RAM supplies which is already hitting the wider tech industry, both for PCs and broader integrated electronics, and GPU makers are shifting focus to meet that currently oh-so-lucrative bubble.</p>
<p>Still, we can try to remain hopeful and optimistic, support the developers and ventures that we like as we go, and enjoy the gaming highlights as they come.</p>
<p>And with that, it’s just left to me to wish you once again a very Happy New Year from the entire TSA team, to thank you for visiting our humble gaming site through the year, and to say we hope you’ll continue to join us for all your gaming news and reviews in 2026!</p>
