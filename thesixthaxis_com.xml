		<p>I’ve definitely felt the nights drawing in this week, and so what better way to embody that in gaming form than with a cosy, witchy puzzle game like Strange Antiquities? Or… clumsy walking simulator Baby Steps? They’re definitely on opposite ends of the gaming spectrum, and only one of them saw me spend around an hour mastering the ability to climb up a slick, muddy hill, and repeatedly slide all the way back down to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has easily had the most exciting week of the lot of us, as he’s flown out to Japan for Tokyo Game Show, getting to go hands on with a bunch of upcoming games –&nbsp;he’s obviously been most excited for Monster Hunter – as well as just soak in the atmosphere and explore Chiba. He even went to a baseball game!</p>

<p>For the next best thing, <strong>Aran</strong> has finally been able to dish out our review of Ghost of Yotei – I still haven’t learnt the key combo to type the special o – and he’s absolutely loved his time with Sucker Punch’s second Japanese adventure. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Read his review here</a>, but he’s already moved on to EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>It’s been a big blend of Dying Light: The Beast, the Atomfall DLC The Red Strain, Discounty, Rise of Industry, and Blippo+ for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, as he reviewed a whole host of things, while <strong>Nic</strong> was a bit more focused and just reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gameplay-trailer-released/">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> – was it thrice as nice as the original PS1 release?</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> and his “fiancé/gaming pal” Laura have been playing the rogue ’em up Absolum for review this week.</p>
<p>Looking for something new to play, <strong>Jim</strong> settled on The Forgotten City, the former Skyrim mod spun out into its own fully-fledged detective sim set during the Roman era. “I was honestly quite surprised how effortlessly it drew me in, being one of the few games to nail a smart and satisfying time loop mechanic.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> hasn’t actually played any games, but has handed in a stinging TV review. “Alien Earth is so, so, so stupid it defies belief,” he says. “I binge-watched all 20 episodes of Celebs Go Dating, and it was much better than Alien Earth because people acted like people with brains, and given that Kerry Katona and a Love Islander are on the show, that’s saying a lot.”</p>
<p>And this whole What We Played is a TGS sandwich, as <strong>Miguel</strong> is also out in Japan. However, on the flight out he was only able to play things in 20 minute chunks, because he couldn’t keep his eyes open for longer through the air on the plane. He’s going to get eyedrops and play more of Megabonk, Is This Seat Taken, Fumes, and some Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on the trip home, though.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played? And have you been in Japan?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/microsoft-finally-confirms-the-rog-xbox-ally-pricing-as-pre-orders-go-live/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It took them long enough, but Microsoft has finally confirmed the pricing for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and ROG Xbox Ally, just a few weeks ahead of the handheld’s launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>The two models are priced as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally X</strong>: Available for $999.99, €899.99, and £799.99</li>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong>: Available for $599.99, €599.99 and £499.99</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s some slightly muddled pricing, no doubt thanks to the very muddled situation with imports and tariffs in the US right now. What’s quite baffling is that while the base model equates $1 to €1, the higher-powered Ally X makes $1 equal to €0.90. Pricing hardware between regions is difficult at the best of times, but this definitely makes the base Ally a bit less appealing in Europe.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X have been developed in partnership between Xbox and Asus, a successor to Asus’ first effort, the 2023 ROG Ally, but with a newer chipset, Xbox branding, and with Microsoft building bespoke gaming features into Windows 11 for this and other PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Sharing the same form factor with proper handgrips and a 7″ 1080p screen, there’s internal difference, but they’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, which combines Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 GPU architecture with 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor which leaps ahead to newer architectures with three Zen 5 cores and five more lower-powered Zen 5c cores, paired with RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture, a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally has architectural basis similar to the Xbox Series X|S consoles, but with different CPU and GPU core counts roughly half of what is found in the Series S. The Ryzen Z2 A is actually using older architecture than the outgoing Ryzen Z1 (which was used in the original ROG Ally), though with a different balance in core counts such that the GPU should be better. The Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme of the ROG Xbox Ally X is also rebalanced in core configuration versus the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, but crucially has both a neural engine that could be used for FSR upscaling, and more GPU compute units for improved baseline graphics performance.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, we eagerly await benchmarks and comparisons to see how these two consoles compare, both to each other, to other handhelds, and to Series S.</p>

		<p>Mario’s final victory is at hand, as Bowser has announced his retirement. Oh wait, it’s not Bowser, the Daimaō of the Koopa Clan? It’s the human Bowser instead?</p>
<p>That’s right, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-announces-retirement-bowser-becomes-president/">who took over as Nintendo of America President in 2019</a>, has announced his retirement and will step down from the role on 31st December 2025. He led NOA through a surprisingly tricky console launch earlier this year, as Nintendo had to navigate the sudden imposition of tariffs in the US for the Switch 2’s release, but ultimately went on to have a hugely successful launch.</p>


<p>Bowser sadly won’t be succeeded by another Mario namesake, but instead by Devon Pritchard. She’s been with Nintendo since 2006 and is a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team, currently holding the position of Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience.</p>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,” said Bowser. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.”</p>
<p>“Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself,” Bowser continued. “She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>

<p>Pritchard said, “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<p>So, pour one out for the recurring jokes about Bowser running Nintendo, but we wish Doug Bowser a happy retirement.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tokyo Game Show 2025 Day One Report – There are a lot of games here, and one of them electrocuted me]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When talking about video games, there’s no place in the world more powerful, more creative, more magical than Japan. The glistening waters of the Tokyo Bay nestle up against looming grey skyscrapers, while vibrant green trees nestle in between. Tokyo is a microcosm of the country itself, the old and the new brushing up next to each other, while nature cradles them both. Lots of the countries I visit feel hard – places born from industry and commerce often are – but the softer edges of Japan’s scenery and history make it all the more inviting, even as I’m shunning the wonders outside for the latest digital wonders inside the Tokyo Game Show 2025</p>
<p>Not immediately though. The entrance to the Makuhari Messe sees us snaking out and around the building, in one of the most orderly and good-natured games expo queues you’ve ever seen. Admittedly, this is the opening of the first business day, so it’s only press, devs and corporate types, but compared to the scrum at Gamescom, it’s thoroughly genteel.</p>

		
		

<p>That’s soon forgotten as the barrage of noise and neon lighting inside is only amplified by the corridor of tote bags, posters, fans and other paraphernalia as you walk into the Messe. It is actually in Chiba and isn’t quite in Tokyo, if we’re being honest, but let’s forget that for now. Lots of shows like to lather you up with the odd bit of tat, but the free stuff is out in force here, with many of the multitude of booths offering you a collectable prize for taking part or completing a section of their game. Am I going to play Professor Layton in Japanese in order to get a keyring? Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>It says something that the first game I’ve played today had me hooked up to an electric shock machine. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/let-it-die-inferno-is-a-brand-new-full-price-entry-in-the-roguelike-series/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> might not have actually killed me, but the extensive health form I had to fill out before taking part did make me question how smart I was for playing a game that’s hooked up to the electrical grid. I don’t have a pacemaker though, and if we’re being honest, I’m not that smart, so let’s carry on with the game-based torture. Getting hit here didn’t just cost HP, it cost the seat of my pants, and if you took damage… well, you took actual damage. I don’t think a game has ever taught me to be careful and block quite so quickly, though, so perhaps this is the future?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that even if I was here for a month, I wouldn’t be able to play everything at this show. The number of booths, the number of games, has eclipsed anything I’ve seen before at Gamescom, GDC or EGX, and I can’t quite reason out the fact that today is a business-to-business day, so should in theory be quieter. The 30-degree heat outside slowly creeps in through the doors, and into the afternoon, the Makuhari Messe turns into a sweatbox, fuelled by the bodies of thousands of people and thousands of PCs pumping out heat. It’s still a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There’s a great deal of queueing though, and I can only guess that the visiting as part of the general public would only let you see one or two major games. The most popular ones here today – those on Sony’s booth or one or two of the biggest publishers – are shut closed by midday, filling their quota without a thought, and giving the lucky few a chance to lord it over their friends with tales of Resident Evil Requiem and Ghost of Yotei before release.</p>
<p>It’s always an odd thing to play games at a show. Just enough to titillate and build your excitement and just enough to make the remaining time until it launches utterly excruciating. For the first time in a while, a number of the titles on the TGS show floor aren’t out until 2026, and that level of separation from your initial trial until they appear almost seems unfair. It’s clear that the public at large don’t seem to feel that – interest for the show is at its height – but this is a show where I simply want to play everything I’ve seen, now. I guess I’ll have to wait like everybody else, and stop acting like a petulant child. That’s harder than you might think.</p>

<p>My highlights on day one have been the bevy of Monster Hunter titles over at the Capcom booth. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-takes-the-series-mythology-in-a-new-and-exciting-direction/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a> are right up my Monster Hunter street, and with Wilds currently losing out to World in our household, it’s clear that we need more Monster Hunter as soon as possible. Besides that, Morbid Metal is fantastic, with its fast-paced Roguelike combat looking and feeling amazing, while Project Motor Racing has me really hoping for a return to form for the spiritual successor to Project Cars.</p>
<p>What’s always nice about game shows is getting to meet up with friends, devs and PR folk – this was the first time I was able to meet our US-based writer Miguel in person! I also enjoyed being fooled by Google maps into thinking everything was ten minutes away from my hotel, but only if I was a car, and I have walked very slowly around most of Chiba today. I can thoroughly recommend the Makuhari Brewery if you’re into craft ale, and I’ve also learned that anime is thoroughly true to life, with the sound of Cicadas ringing out so loudly that I’m glad my hotel isn’t near any trees. On the seafront, I also saw a group of three Japanese students – two boys and a girl – and can only assume that they’re currently fighting demons or travelling through time, as that’s the start of every anime I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The sun set on the first day of the Tokyo Game Show a while ago – who knew that the other side of the world has a different season going on? – but it’s clear that the Japanese development scene, and the wider development community, still place TGS at the centre of their plans. As day two is close – closer perhaps than it should be – my biggest problem is working out what on earth I’m going to play. If today is anything to go on, we are truly living in a golden age of game development, and there’s a huge number of games that deserve to find an audience. I’ll do my best to find them tomorrow.</p>
