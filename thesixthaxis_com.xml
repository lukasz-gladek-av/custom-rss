			<p>There’s plenty of mobile games that make the most of their touchscreen input, but if you’re wanting to play action titles or stream something over Game Pass or Luna, you probably want a controller. Now, you can prop your phone up against something, and use a Bluetooth equipped controller like the official Xbox one, or the PS5’s DualSense, and it’ll work admirably well, but something like the GameSir X5 Lite Type-C is going to turn your phone into a perfect little portable, and it’s an ideal option if you’re looking for mobile gaming on a budget.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir X5 Lite — Wider. Lighter. Comfier. | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQuacraRpMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a clamp-style device, with two generous controller grips tethered by an expandable plastic backplate. In between the two controller portions is where you slot your phone, stretching the X5 Lite out and connecting it to your phone via the USB-C socket at one end. There’s a good deal of give here, and you can play with a range of phones or small tablets up to 213mm, so long as they’re equipped with USB Type-C. This means that even an iPad Mini can be slotted into place. There’s no alternative Bluetooth connection, so that’s it, but there is a USB-C port so you can also charge your device while playing. It’s worth noting that this isn’t capable of sending data though, in case you were looking for passthrough for other connections.</p>


<p>My Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was a perfect fit, and makes the unit look like a handheld console. It also feels rock-solid in your hand, and I had no worries about my phone falling out, or any part of the X5 feeling loose or weak. There’s a selection of rubber grips to make sure you phone is held in place as solidly as possible, but I had no problems with it after removing them entirely to ensure the easiest connection to my phone. It’s not the most attractive device I’ve ever seen, but the black plastic and straightforward, utilitarian looks get the job done.</p>


<p>Given the range of options on Android, from streaming, through native Android games, all the way to a bevy of retro console emulators, this is a great fit for someone who wants full control over their mobile gaming experience, with as little fuss, or extra steps as humanly possible. Slot your phone into the X5 Lite, and away you go.</p>
<p>I’ve done the majority of my testing of the GameSir X5 Lite with Amazon Luna, but it will, of course, work with any mobile titles that are setup for a real controller. That’s meant I’ve been able to dive into a bunch of classic titles that I’ve got squirreled away there, and I thought Watch Dogs 2 might be a fun fit with its stealth-based hacking action. Straight off the bat, the X5 Lite just glides into your hands, with two really comfortable moulded grips making it feel like a full-sized controller. It’s definitely simple and straightforward – there’s only the central inputs you’d expect, and no additional ‘pro’ styled buttons – but it immediately sets out its stall as a device you can spend a decent amount of time with.</p>
<p>Priced at £34.99 in the UK – though available for even less via platforms like AliExpress – the most surprising feature at this price point, and as the ‘Lite’ edition, is the inclusion of Hall Effect sticks. The stick tops are pretty small, so you do feel a slight reduction in grip and control, but the level of weight and tautness is excellent, and with the magnetic technology within, they shouldn’t develop stick drift even if you spend every waking hour playing Call of Duty Mobile.</p>

<p>You can feel the reduction in cost through the missing features – there’s no rumble – and the other inputs, though they all function perfectly well. The four main face buttons are quite tightly packed together, and they’ve been shrunk down to fit the X5’s smaller body, which may affect usability if you’ve got great big thumbs, or you just mash all your buttons at the same time. If your phone has powerful haptic feedback, you may not notice the X5’s lack of rumble, but I found that my Pixel 9 Pro XL just made a horrid buzzing sound whenever the haptics fired or a got a notification, so I made sure to turn it off when gaming.</p>
<p>The D-pad does a good job of getting you through menus, and a run through some classic platformers showed that it’s precise enough for some retro platforming. It wasn’t a great choice for Street Fighter 2 though, and proved too easy to slide off to reliably perform a Hadouken. Whether that’s a dealbreaker for you depends on the type of games you’re planning to play.</p>
<p>I do like the shoulder buttons, which feel nice and solid beneath your fingers, and respond well no matter where you press them, but the triggers are sadly less enjoyable to use, with digital, non-analogue inputs, and a horrible clacking noise with each activation. They’re easily the weakest part of the X5, and if you’re hoping to play a lot of FPS titles, then you might tire of them quite quickly.</p>

<p>GameSir have their own app, which gives you greater control over the X5 Lite and your mobile titles, helping you to update the controller’s firmware, perform input tests, and customise the controls, including altering your dead zones, and shifting between a Nintendo Switch style layout or an Xbox one. There’s three options for game control, with native support recognising the X5 immediately as an input, while hardware mapping and software mapping let you customise inputs if necessary too.</p>
<p>The GameSir app also has its own game library and discovery tool, recommending various titles from Apex Legends through to Genshin Impact, all of which work perfectly with the X5 Lite. It really is designed to make mobile gaming a more viable, and console-like experience, and at this price, it’s certainly worth considering.</p>

		<p>DreadXP and developer Cara Cadaver have announced that VILE: Exhumed is being released as a free shareware title, after the game got caught up in Steam’s mass banning of games due to payment processors refusing to allow people to buy certain games. It was banned for “sexual content with depictions of real people,” even though the game does not contain any of this. Instead, the game is about the developer’s own experience stalking and violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="VILE: EXHUMED | VILEISBANNED.COM" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6lOV2KN_Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cara Cadaver said,<em> “This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. This is our response to being censored, and our rejection of the idea that horror can be defined as acceptable or not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As soon as we realized that the game had been banned, the conversation internally with Cara became about what we collectively could do to do right by her and her work. In the face of widespread attempted censorship, it didn’t feel like a time for half-measures and compromise, so we all decided that releasing the game into the wild where it could never be made unavailable by a single platform felt like the best option, and strongest message.”</em> said DreadXP Director, Hunter Bond.</p>

<p>VILE: Exhumed is available to purchase from the website <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">Vile Is Banned,</a> from where users can download the game for free or choose to donate funds. Cara has said that 50% of all profits will be donated to the charity Red Door Family Shelter, which is based in Toronto and helps families, refugees, and women who are getting out of violent situations.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced an Indie World Nintendo Direct stream will be taking place on Thursday, 7th August.</p>
<p>The stream will kick off at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 9AM EDT / 6AM PDT) and will run for a tight 15 minutes with a blend of announcements and updates on games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTv0HmKoUqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It follows on from the partner showcase last week, which was stuffed with a whole host of announcements like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-with-its-first-action-packed-trailer/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-a-hd-2d-prequel-coming-to-switch-switch-2-this-year/">Octopatch Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot</a>. In hindsight, there were next to no indie games included in that stream, leaving some big open goals for this Indie World stream to shoot for.</p>
<p>There’s a number of key indie titles that are expected for Switch that could make an appearance here, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-2">Hades 2</a> which is set to be a console exclusive, or the very, very highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if everyone’s wishes are fulfilled!</p>
