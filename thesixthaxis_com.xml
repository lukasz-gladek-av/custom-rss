		<p>Kaznori Yamauchi made a brief appearance during the State of Play Japan stream with a key announcement for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. With the GT7 Spec III coming out on 4th December, Polyphony Digital has also prepared a new Power Pack DLC to go alongside.</p>

<p>The Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack is a premium DLC that’s all about bringing fully fledged endurance racing to the popular sim racer for the first time.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not the first time that full-on 24 hour races have featured as part of a Gran Turismo game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/11/24/review-gran-turismo-5/">GT5</a> you could race a full 24 hour race yourself, and put your B-Spec AI drivers into the mixer for some progression while you’re not actively playing the game, but endurance racing provides different challenges for the racing AI, pit stop strategies and more.</p>
<p>Of course, we’d have loved to have seen longer form racing included in GT7 from the off – it’s often a bit of an afterthought, given the demands i puts on both players, game designers, and testers – but Polyphony should be credited with consistently updating and expanding their games with free content, new tracks and more.</p>

<p>Spec 3 will be a big update for the 2022 racer, with the following new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 new tracks (Yas Marina Circuit, Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve)</li>
<li>8 new cars</li>
<li>‘Dunlop’ tyres</li>
<li>Data Logger</li>
<li>Collector Level cap increased</li>
<li>Unlimited car invitations in Brand Central</li>
<li>Enhanced Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>New opening movie</li>
<li>New Menu Book ‘Seasonal Menu’</li>
<li>New events in ‘Circuit Experience’</li>
<li>New Curations in ‘Scapes’</li>
<li>Improvements to online races</li>
</ul>

		<p>Koei Tecmo has revealed that Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake will launch on 12th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5x21cCkMaYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remake of this horror classic will, of course, bring enhanced visuals, as well as some gameplay tweaks, so you can now have greater control of the integral camera in the game, able to zoom and focus with it.</p>
