<p>In our review, Adrian said, <em>“Ninja Gaiden 2 Black offers a comprehensive remake of Team Ninja’s finest game, rendered in beautiful modern visuals. Combat is as bombastically brilliant as it ever was, though the awful camera will put off many of those new to the game, it really hasn’t aged well. Still, as a reminder of how good Ninja Gaiden can be, this remake offers a tantalising taste of what we can all look forward to when Ninja Gaiden 4 is released later this year.”</em></p>

<p>We scored Elden Ring top marks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">10/10 in our review</a>&nbsp;back in February 2022. “Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for,” said Jason. “From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent’s back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.”</p>
