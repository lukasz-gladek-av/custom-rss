		<p>Nintendo has added prices to the online store pages for Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game upgrades in the UK, confirming that there will be multiple price points, depending on the games.</p>
<p>For more straightforward upgrades like Breath of the Wild, Nintendo will be charging £7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99, while Switch 2 Edition games that also gain a significant amount of DLC content, such as Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be priced at £16.99 / €19.99 and likely at $19.99 in the US.</p>


<p>The four games with live listings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV </a><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html"> Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I feel like the worst effect that these Switch 2 upgrades has had is to make the game titles practically unreadable. Did the Super Mario Party Jamboree content really need to be called Jamboree TV again, and have a ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’ sandwiched right in the middle of it? at least ‘Star-Crossed World’ sounds like a DLC expansion, but Jamboree TV sounds like the marketing department got lost mid title and wrote it again.</p>
<p>But you pay extra for those additional words, because they add a bunch of extra stuff to each game. Jamboree TV has new camera and Mouse-Con mini-games, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/13/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-switch-2-edition-preview/">Star-Crossed World remixes the original game with new frozen world elements</a>.</p>

<p>Given this pricing, we would expect that future cross-gen Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has new graphics modes and mouse controls, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is a more straightforward resolution and performance bump, will have a £8 price bump over the Nintendo Switch versions.</p>
<p>This also suggests that third parties will likely have a good bit of freedom to price upgrades how they see fit, especially as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo is also making free updates</a> for a number of games from the Switch back catalogue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Switch 2 Edition games will be sold as Switch 2 cartridges physically</a>, though it will likely be more cost effective to buy the Nintendo Switch version and then the upgrade separately, which will work with either digital or physical copies of each game. Kirby, for example, is priced at £66 all-in on the eShop, but would be £55 if you buy the Switch game from Argos for £38 and then upgrade.</p>
