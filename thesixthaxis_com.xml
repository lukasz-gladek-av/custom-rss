		<p>Amazon have announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/20/fallout-season-2-confirmed-sony-paramount/">which was commissioned just a week after the first </a>had aired, finds Lucy (Ella Purnell), Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and Maximus (Aaron Moten) as they travel to New Vegas in an attempt to catch up with Lucy’s father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan).</p>
<p>Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.&nbsp; Barb, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, will also join the cast, and most excitingly, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32158505/?ref_=tt_eps_nx">IMDB, Dogmeat</a> will be in the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals that fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, and he has a connection to Ghoul, or more specifically, Cooper Howard, the pre-war era actor who eventually became Ghoul. There is also a tease of a Deathclaw right at the end and lots of head popping gory action, just like the first series.</p>
<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue.</p>

<p>The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>
