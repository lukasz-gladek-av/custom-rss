		<p>Lunar Software has given an update on the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a>, the long-awaited retro-futuristic sci-fi horror game. As part of this,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700"> they’ve shared some new screenshots</a> of the game to whet your appetites once more, as well as some news about the soundtrack and Mick Gordon’s involvement.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the bad news, which is that Mick Gordon is no longer composing for the game. “In July 2024 Mick made the difficult decision to leave the project because of conflicts in his schedule,” the team writes. But all is not lost. “During his time with us, Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for ROUTINE. These contributions will now be implemented by a new audio designer and team.”</p>


<p>On to the good-ish news. Writing together as a three-person team, Lunar’s Aaron, Jemma and Pete say:</p>
<p>“We know it’s been a while since our last update. Working on ROUTINE has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing ROUTINE. But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>



<p>“In short, ROUTINE is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>We actually got to see a little snippet of gameplay recently when visiting Raw Fury, with the message being that the game was coming towards its final stages.</p>

		
		

<p>Until their next update, which hopefully won’t be quite so far away, they have a few screenshots to share from Union Plaza. This is a struggling tourist attraction on the Moon with the Living Quarters, Arcade and Mall all featured. It was within this Mall that we saw our gameplay snippet, using a strange video cassette gun to reveal secret messages, using dark light splatter to detect fingers on an interactive panel, and more. It was just a brief demo, though.</p>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">The last update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>

			<p>In the annals of mascot platformers, Gex goes largely forgotten. Behind the colossi of Mario, Sonic and even the second string of Crash and Spyro, the lecherous gecko ends up alongside the likes of Bubsy the Bob Cat in prestige. Unlike that feline protagonist, however, Gex has starred in some decent games. The relatively long-awaited Limited Run collection of the Gex Trilogy is the perfect way to try these titles on modern consoles. That being said, this is very much a time capsule of the late 90s context of the games with all that entails – good and bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gex Trilogy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7voeA0cKjB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before going on to look at each of the three games individually, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the package as a whole. Limited Run are at pains to state that this is not a remake or remaster but instead uses their own Carbon Engine to present fully authentic versions of each game, albeit with quality of life improvements such as widescreen and analogue controls for 2 and 3. Saving is also improved, but does need to be done manually so make sure you don’t rely on the modern convenience of autosave. These are welcome improvements, but the end result is more like emulation than anything more involved and this has garnered some negative responses from buyers and fans. I knew this was the case going in and so am judging the collection based on what it is rather than any great Gexpectations. That being said, the lack of the Game Boy and N64 versions being included in the bundle is disappointing when compared to the likes of the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/"> Turtles Cowabunga Collection</a>.</p>


<p>There are a range of Gextras (Limited Run’s pun, though one I thoroughly approve of) included such as trailers, artwork, and a soundtrack player. These are nice inclusions, but feel a little clunky – the music player in particular is difficult to use. A better alternative would have been a separate soundtrack download as is the case with many collector’s editions. Looking back at the print and TV ads for the games is certainly illuminating in a nostalgic way and sets the scene for the lad’s mag and celebrity culture they were written to cater to.</p>


<p>With the context set, let’s turn to the games. First up is the 2D original Gex which is a landmark title having first been released on the 3D0 in 1995. Billed as the first 32-bit platformer it certainly turned heads back in the day, but not far enough to rescue a doomed system. Pretty soon after it was ported to PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, and it’s the former version that’s included here.</p>
<p>All that history in min,d I should probably talk about the game itself, but it’s honestly awful. Floaty controls, an overly large sprite and confusing level design all combine to make a title that is difficult to enjoy. If you do try it in order to experience the full series then at least there is a rewind function similar to most emulation programs (familiar if you’ve used the Switch Online systems) to help make it past some of the most frustrating and annoying sections. Trust me, you’ll be using this a lot.</p>

<p>With that Gextremely annoying first title out of the way things take a turn for the better. Gex: Enter the Gecko is a very traditional 3D platformer which clearly takes a great deal of influence from the likes of Mario 64 and especially Rare collectathons. Both PAL and NTSC versions are included in the package and I opted to play the European titles for the Gexclusive voice acting. The second game features the silky tones of legendary lothario Leslie Philips which makes for some entertaining incongruities as he quotes now dated cultural references such as “It’s like I’ve woken up in Boy George’s pants!”</p>
<p>Traversal through the game takes the familiar route of a hub world with portals to levels in which multiple objectives can be completed. Doing so unlocks remotes which in turn open up more levels and boss battles. While you don’t need to collect every remote to finish the game there is an Gextra ending scene in each game if you do so apparently (although they seemed to play for me without having done so). Every level also has Gexclusive collectables and gathering enough also awards a remote. As you work through the game you’ll visit a range of worlds inspired by TV and film including classic horror, kung fu movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. Gex has different costumes for each world, but these are entirely cosmetic in this title aside from a memorable boss fight where Gex gets to act out your T-Gex fantasies and fight as a kaiju.</p>

<p>The third game in the trilogy, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, takes all the mechanics and systems from the second and improves on them. The hub world makes another appearance, although this time it’s a secret agent base for Gex who is now voiced by Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf fame. While the more modern voice acting is a much better fit for the sassy lizard, there are still the same dated references and parts that have not aged well. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Baywatch babe as Agent Xtra – Marliece Andrada, also known for the epic Playboy babes of Baywatch. Her appearances are mostly restricted to cringey video calls in which Gex gets to make some of the most inappropriate lines this side of an 80s Bond movie. The ending of the game famously suggests an altercation between the two heroes that the Angry Video Game Nerd was not Gexpecting. A Wild West level in which Gex rides a donkey also includes a caricature of the lizard as a Gexican that wouldn’t pass the sniff test nowadays.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gex Trilogy is a good window into the history of gaming and the 3D games are still fun collectathon platformers, albeit with all the camera and control issues of the originals, and the awful 2D original I never want to play again. I would have liked to see a more Gexpansive remaster, and the result may not be entirely Gexceptional, but offers enough Gexperience to give you the kind of Gexual healing that only true nostalgia can provide.	</p></div>
