		<p>It’s no Seikret that we love Monster Hunter here at TSA. There probably isn’t a Monster Hunter title that we haven’t poured hundreds of hours into between us, and it’s probably best we don’t think about the upper limit of that number… Much better to think about all the exciting and fun times that await in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>And so, when our friends at Capcom offered us a chance to come play the first four hours of the game — completely uninterrupted —&nbsp;along with two special hunts from later in the game, we seized the opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 6th Trailer | Into the Iceshard Cliffs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFoueW07mxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This, naturally, came with the same kind of caveats that any pre-release game build has. The multiplayer aspect was still a little sticky and the lip sync wasn’t quite, well, synced. They’re minor issues that are sure to be rounded off in the final weeks and months of development, and the amount of polish that is on show throughout the game is already impressive.</p>
<p>We picked up the game after the opening sequence we last played in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our first Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a> last September. We escorted Y’sai back to his Kunafa village, taking in the scenery and meeting some colourful new characters along the way. One of our colleagues at the base asked us to keep an eye out for some honey so Y’sai pointed it out for us along the way.</p>

<p>But, as much as I love honey – and hot honey is, of course, very trendy right now – what I was really waiting for was a mission, and it didn’t take long before we were asked to kill a Quematrice — a Brute Wyvern new to Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>

<p>It’s always exciting to come across new beasties, and the Quematrice did not disappoint. This greenish-brown brute with red and blue scales has a large comb atop its head, and a wattle on its throat, giving it the appearance of a cockatrice — unsurprising perhaps given its name. It also has a very large tail that sprays oil on the ground, which it then strikes to ignite.</p>
<p>Aggressive though it was, we dispatched it and moved on, meeting up with Y’sai to continue the dual mission of reuniting Nata with The Keepers and hunting down the White Wraith.</p>
<p>What was doubly exciting is that, unlike the old days of Monster Hunters past, we weren’t sitting around watching load screens. Instead we could just run out the base and leg it to where the monster waited, battle it and then simply move towards our next target in this large open biome.</p>
<p>We soon wind up in a forest, meet some new characters and stumble across what was easily my favourite monster of the day, a Lala Barina. This temnoceran (a monster type that covers arachnid-likes) is also new to Wilds, and is also pretty cool. Well, so long as you like spiders that are red, white and fluffy all over, and have spikey legs. When enraged, its abdomen opens up into what looks like a large rose, and this is where it gets really cool. It shoots out ‘florets’ — neuroleptics that float in the air ready to ensnare and paralyse you.</p>

<p>Naturally, we killed that and moved on, setting up a pop-up base in the Forest along the way. This is a great new mechanic in that, unlike in Worlds, the base can be destroyed by local monsters. In this case it was ransacked by some Wudwuds. These are basically Monster Hunter’s version of the Ewoks, if they were taught English by a surfer from the 60s. It’s a little jarring at first, but unlike your Felyne’s English voice (I quickly changed the setting to Felyne language), it quickly becomes endearing.</p>
<p>A bout with the farting gorilla monster of a Congalala brought back some misty memories of the first time I battled one back in 2006, but the next treat in this area was another brand-new monster, the Uth Duna.</p>
<p>In testament to its strength, we didn’t have to kill this one, just repel it. This leviathan was impressive, coating itself with a veil of water that repels attacks and moving with incredible speed and agility in terrain that you struggle to just walk in. While it was a nightmare to fight, it was gorgeous to look at.</p>

<p>And that’s where our story preview ended. The opening hours had us facing off against three new monsters — a fire, paralysis and water type — and have a crack at an old favourite that hasn’t been seen in a main-series game since 2014. We got to see a few new biomes, meet some new characters, and see the quality of life updates that will be very exciting for long-term fans, and even just those wanting a true sequel to World.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t where our time with the game ended, with two more new monsters and two more biomes from later in the game to see. First was the Rompopolo in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>This monster has a fascinating design. Rather than the typical Brute Wyvern build, it has an insectile head with a mosquito-like nose, scythe-like hands, a forked tongue and a stinger. It uses these appendages not only to jab and slash, but to either shoot jets of poison or inject it into the ground, causing explosion of oil and tar.</p>
<p>All this made for a pretty exciting fight — despite its aggressive nature, we still took it down inside of 10 minutes, like everything else today.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final monster — the temnoceran Nerscylla in the Iceshard Cliffs.</p>
<p>It was really exciting to get a chance to try another new temnoceran that attacks in a very different way. Instead of paralysis, this one uses poison to attack. It also flings itself across the room like Spider-Man, occasionally dangling from the ceiling as it watches its tiny spider spawn try to rush you. Fortunately, it can be shot down from its cocky little perch with a well-placed shot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about this monster is that if offers a unique insight into the ecology of Monster Hunter. Look carefully and you’ll see that it is wearing a Gypceros hide. That’s some Silence of the Lambs-level nonsense right there.</p>
<p>Our key takeaways from this final preview hands on are that the game is shaping up incredibly well. Combat is smooth and slick, and feels even better than it did in our first preview. The addition of wound damage in Wilds is excellent, adding another dimension to gameplay.</p>
<p>The new monsters we fought are all unique in their own ways, and the biomes we visited are both vast and exciting, underpinning that sense of adventure that comes with each new game. While the weapons and mechanics are familiar, as are some of the monsters that you fight, Wilds feels like a brand new adventure, and that is incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes out in just a few short weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-out-in-february-2025/">on 28th February</a>, but I am itching to get my hands on it once again. And if you’re a fan of either the franchise or the genre, you should be too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/edifier-hecate-gx05-gaming-earbuds-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You really do owe it to yourself, to your games, and to the audio designers and composers out there to make sure you can hear the games you’re playing with the best fidelity possible. Outside of a new GPU for PC gamers, or a fancy new OLED TV or monitor, high quality earbuds or headphones are perhaps the best way to upgrade your entire gaming experience.&nbsp;With the Edifier Hecate GX05, a pair of gaming-focussed true wireless earbuds, Hecate may have won the award for most over-engineered earbud case, but frankly, I couldn’t love it any more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edifier Hecate GX05 - 15ms Ultra Low Latency Gaming Earbuds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNT1iS7OLGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The unboxing experience is immediately a bit different. The GX05 arrives in a serious plastic case emblazoned with the Hecate logo and a big red clasp. Opening it feels like you’re going to find a top-quality watch inside rather than a pair of earbuds, but you immediately see the metal form of the GX05’s charging case nestled at the centre of the package.</p>


<p>It looks, for want of anything else, like a prop from a Star Wars movie. It’s seriously heavy, with its metal build adding both weight and the sense that this is a premium product. The earbuds, and the 2.4Ghz USB-C dongle nestle inside, protected by a three-armed metal frame that rotates with a supremely satisfying click. Rotating this frame also starts the RGB lighting, with the case itself and each earbud boasting matching lighting strips. I expected a hologram of Princess Leia to jump from it, and the only disappointment was that it didn’t…</p>
<p>All that weight and the many edges mean that the Hecate GX05’s case is not one you’re likely to pop in your pocket, and probably not in a bag with any other uprotected electronics – the zinc alloy build means it’s more than likely to scratch any screen it comes into contact with. Still, it makes a great focal piece if it’s kept on the side, or, perhaps it would do a great job as an illuminated paperweight.</p>


<p>The premium experience is borne out by the GX05’s £149.99 RRP, though if you’re willing to import, it looks as though you can find it for well under that. The earbuds themselves match the silver finish of the case, though rather than being fashioned from metal, they’re light and sturdy plastic. The body of each is a little chunky, but I found they stayed easily in place, and looked sleek enough to any observers, especially with the ice blue RGB strips lending them something of a Tron look.</p>
<p>The RGB is controlled via the case, with the pairing button on the underside taking double duty to cycle through the different solid or breathing colours. Those looking for something a little more subdued will be happy to know that you can turn them off altogether, but if you do that, are you really a G4M3R?</p>
<p>If you’re connecting via Bluetooth, the GX05 is capable of the standard SBC codec or the high-resolution LHDC 5.0, meaning that it’s certified for Hi-Res wireless audio, but only if you’ve got a device capable of it. I’ve got a brand-new Honor Magic V3 and it supports LDAC but not LHDC, meaning that I’m stuck to the painfully ordinary SBC unless I use the dongle. Using SBC, the sound is fine, but far from special.</p>
<p>The GX05 comes to life when you use the dongle. Given that most things made in the last couple of years are equipped with USB-C, it worked perfectly with my MacBook, Nintendo Switch, the Magic V3 and my PC, and the audio quality is absolutely fantastic, the 10mm drivers delivering crystal clear audio directly to your ears.</p>

<p>I did find that it seemed more important to get the eartip sizing right than with some earbuds, but once I’d selected the right one, it delivered both high and low frequencies with stunning detail. Given the Hi-Res certification, it’s almost reductive to say that I was able to hear parts of a song that I’d never heard before, but in the case of Papa Roach’s Liar – on heavy rotation thanks to watching them live this week – it sounded like an entirely new song.</p>
<p>The Hecate GX05 do a fantastic job with music, but they are designed for gaming, with a low 15ms latency helping keep you in tune with the on-screen action, while the high-quality audio delivers every detail. I put them through their paces with some Overwatch 2, and I could hear the enemy team running for their life – I might have imagined that bit – while picking up the movements of those still coming to try and take mine.</p>
<p>The microphones do a decent job of keeping things clear and concise, letting your teammates know exactly why you’re not very happy as no one plays the objective as they run off in random directions – I hate multiplayer gaming sometimes. That’s not the GX05’s fault though, and they’ve proven to be a great companion for gaming, no matter what’s happening on screen.</p>
