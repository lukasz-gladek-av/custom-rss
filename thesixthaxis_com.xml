		<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/spacecraft-is-the-new-game-from-shiro-games/">SpaceCraft was revealed as the new game from Shiro Games</a>, developer of Wartales, Northgard, and Dune: Spice Wars. Now, Shiro Games has released a brand new developer video for the multiplayer space sim, which goes into looking at flying a ship through space and wandering around a space station which will serve as a hub and a base.</p>

<p><em>“SpaceCraft&nbsp;is an ambitious game for us, and one I’ve always dreamed of making,”</em> says lead designer and Shiro Games CEO Nicolas Carnasse. <em>“One of the things Shiro always strives to do is combine big design ideas in a way that just makes sense when players pick it up, and I think&nbsp;SpaceCraft&nbsp;is a perfect example of that philosophy.”</em></p>
<p>The developer diary for SpaceCraft kicks off with space flight, which players will be able to do with their own customisable ship. As you fly through the void, you will be able to look for new planets which you can touch down upon to search for resources that you and everyone needs to rebuild civilisation. As you find these resources, you can build facilities to mine them. From here you can create full industries that cover everything from mining to transporting the good. Players can work together to create organisations and trade routes to get the resources to where they need to go. On the space station, you can modify the ship with various modules depending on what you need, be it a mining ship or a weapons ship. Every module will impact the handling of the ship, so you will need to balance things properly. The space station will also have shared hubs where players can communicate and trade with each other.</p>

<p>In SpaceCraft, humanity has had to leave the Milky Way after a devastating defeat by the Tripods. The remnants travel through a portal that delivers them to an uncharted galaxy, where humanity must learn to rebuild and survive. SpaceCraft will launch later this year for PC.</p>

		<p>Konami has announced that it will be hosting a stream on Thursday June 12th, called Konami Press Start, which will be air at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM BST/ 3:00 PM CEST. Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be present during the showcase, plus other announcements.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Konami are being pretty specific with the timing, stating the stream will last 37 minutes. So, we have two games confirmed for the showcase but they probably won’t take up the entire runtime. It is likely there will be some update regarding eFootball, possibly around the Club World Cup, since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/fifa-and-konami-sign-partnership-deal/">FIFA and Konami signed a partnership deal</a> back in October. That still leaves a vast library of IPs that Konami can draw on. People will likely be hoping for mention of a new Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid Collection Vol.2, mention of more Yu-Gi-Oh, and Bomberman. Maybe we’ll see some very dormant IPs turn up too like Zone of the Enders or Bloody Roar. It is likely the company will show something completely new too.</p>
<p>We will know exactly what Konami has up its sleeve in just a few days time.</p>
