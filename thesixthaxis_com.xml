		<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODkzMTgwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTM2NjA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJDMzlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.I9EjU4x5-ZG-gThi468SKf5IF8l5lg2jKLB9q7K5vyM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg report</a> on the state of Warner Bros. Games has claimed that Rocksteady is back to working on a single-player Batman game, while the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith was rebooted last year after a change of directors.</p>
<p>The report looks into Warner Bros. Games following <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">the departure of CEO David Haddad at the end of January</a>, with the games division having to writedown $300 million through 2024.</p>


<p>If there’s a silver lining for any gamers to Warner having a terrible year, it’s that Rocksteady is reportedly back to working on single-player games and on Batman specifically.</p>
<p>“Rocksteady is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game, but according to people familiar with the timeline, the new project is years away from landing,” Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier writes.</p>
<p>On Wonder Woman, Schreier said, “One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market.”</p>

<p>This would be a major disappointment from a well-regarded team. Monolith developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/10/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review/">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review/">Shadow of War</a>, pioneering the Nemesis system through the open world adventures. Shadow of War launched in 2017, but it wasn’t until <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">December 2021 that the Wonder Woman game was announced</a>, and with if the project has been rebooted, wiping out years of progress, it could conceivably still be almost a decade between their games.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s looking to be a lean few years for Warner Bros. Games, following on from a disastrous 2024 that saw the flopped launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">soon-to-be-shut-down MultiVersus</a> – a huge fall off from the heights of 2023 with Hogwarts Legacy leading the way and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>With most of its main studios having released a game within the last couple years, having Wonder Woman’s development being rebooted would mean the slate is pretty much clear for a good while. A new Lego game from TT Games, a Hogwarts Legacy sequel from Avalanche, and a new fighting game from NetherRealm are all likely to be a few years away as well.</p>
<p>A difficult time, but hopefully WB can weather the slow years ahead.</p>

		<p>This week’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-7">Civilization 7</a> – well, for Deluxe Edition buyers at least – has been met by some mixed reviews, both from the press and early adopters of the new game.</p>
<p>While most reviews on Steam highlight the game’s potential, as it expands on the series’ 4X gameplay with the concept of historical ages, but they almost universally criticise the game’s UI, and there’s smattering complaints over the map variety and sizes, and various other quality of life deficiencies.</p>


<p>In response, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">Firaxis has released a statement</a> acknowledging the issues, and highlighting the three key areas that they will be addressing as soon as possible:</p>
<p>Over the last few days, the team has been poring over your feedback, including our most recent Steam Reviews during the Early Access period. As stewards of the <i>Civilization</i>franchise, we hold ourselves to a high standard and always strive to create the best game possible. <i>Civ</i> would not have come this far without you, and your opinions matter greatly to us.</p>
<p>In response to your feedback, we’ve identified three key areas that we’re prioritizing work against as quickly as possible. We will share a development roadmap as soon as we can, but our focus is on the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b>Prioritizing UI Improvements: </b>Our top priority is improving the UI. We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we’re already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more. We’re committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.</li>
<li><b>Implementing Community-Requested Features: </b>Several key features that we’ve seen you ask for will be included in upcoming patches as free updates, and we’ll continue to work with the community to improve and add to the game. We’re still working on exact timing, but can share the following items are being prioritized:
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Rolling Out Quality-of-Life Updates in Patch 1.1.0 (Deploying in March):</b> Work is already well underway on Patch 1.1.0, which includes fixes and adjustments that were already on our radar. This list includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Civilization 7 is an ambitious new take on what is the go-to historical 4X strategy series. Split each game up into &nbsp;three distinct ages – Antiquity, Exploration and Modern – each civ is now restricted to a particular time period and then has to grow and morph into another through a point of crisis. Rome will eventually fall, but that can provide the historical and gameplay foundations to become any number of medieval empires – the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps? – and from there lead into modern European nations.</p>
<p>Another key change is that this game is fully cross-platform from launch – it’s launched across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch – where Civilization VI was originally released for PC in 2016 and only ported to consoles and mobile devices after that. One might expect that some of the UI complaints have come from that broader focus.</p>
<p>We’ve only just got our hands on with the game and will be working to deliver our review as soon as we can.</p>
