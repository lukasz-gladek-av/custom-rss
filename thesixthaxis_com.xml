		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>
