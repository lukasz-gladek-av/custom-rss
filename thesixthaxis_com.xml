		<p>If you’re still absolutely addicted to Blizzard’s Overwatch 2, despite the shiny new pull of Marvel Rivals, then do we have some good news for you! Well, that is, if you’re a Mercy main and you’re not on an enemy team facing her. Anyway, Blizzard have announced the return of the ‘Moth Meta’ to the game, as part of the Overwatch Classic trawl through the game’s greatest hits/builds. </p>
<p><iframe title="When Mercy Broke Overwatch - The Moth Meta" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pubueAeyN8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What is the Moth Meta? It was Mercy’s chance to shine, by utterly breaking the game with her resurrection ability. It let Mercy players resurrect teammates instantly, use her ultimate to recharge the ability, and then get another two shots at resurrection while that was running. This was obviously a nightmare for enemy teams, and there’s probably a good reason that it’s not a thing anymore. But! It was a hell of a time, and now you can experience that same joy/frustration while the mode runs from now until the 17th of February.</p>
<p>What else are we getting? Well, Overwatch Classic continues to experiment with 6v6, and this time you can try it out with Min 1, Max 3 team compositions, experimenting with the way different Tanks, DPS and Healers can achieve success, without filling your team with 6 Tjorbörns. It’s a great question as to whether we’ll get a permanent 6v6 mode at the end of this, that’s both modern and fun to play, but it’s a fun little trip either way. </p>
<p>Besides that, Doomfist arrives as a DPS, and Symmetra is once more equipped with her Shield Generator, mixing up the way these characters play, and how you’re going to need to respond to them. You can do that on three classic maps too, with Oasis, Junkertown and Eichenwalde returning to rotation. </p>


<p>Otherwise, at this midpoint in Season 14, there’s the arrival of the Mythic Lead Rose Ashe weapon skin, which does look suitably cool, and with the end of the Year of the Snake celebrations we’re moving onto Valentines Day which will run from the 4th of February until the 18th, bringing with it Love of Geometry which sees teams of four cupid Hanzos fight for love and supremacy. How romantic!</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of announcing a community collaboration program, Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield </a>game is expected to launch before April 2026.</p>
<p>Revealed with <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">the third quarter FY25 results</a>, this release window puts it within the upcoming ’26 fiscal year, which could mean a game launch before the end of 2025.</p>


<p>Monday saw the announcement of Battlefield Labs,&nbsp;a community collaboration project aiming to get direct feedback and shape the development of the next Battlefield by a group of studios that includes Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios – now under the collective name of Battlefield Studios. As part of this announcement video, we also got to see some snippets of gameplay footage from the upcoming game, which has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/24/report-the-next-battlefield-6-is-already-in-pre-production-after-battlefield-2042-flop/">reportedly been in development since early 2022</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thanks to an interview with Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organisation Vince Zampella last year, we already knew that the next Battlefield has come back to a modern setting, will feature classes as opposed to character &amp; 64 players will be the largest mode. The latter two points were already elements that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/19/battlefield-2042-update-4-1-ditches-128-player-breakthrough-patch-notes-server-maintenance/">DICE rolled Battlefield 2042 back to</a> through the game’s post-launch support.</p>

<p>With this foundational reversion already in place, it seems that Battlefield Labs is more about putting the final touches onto the game, than it is really resetting the direction based on community feedback. There could still be overhauls to character class loadouts, balance changes to weapons and vehicles, amendments player progression, but the next Battlefield is already set to bring back the fundamental core structure of the game series that was at the heart of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4.</p>
<p>The Battlefield Labs announcement also confirmed what each of the four Battlefield Studios teams is working on. DICE is in charge of the multiplayer, while Criterion is focussed on the single player, and Motive is supporting both of these efforts. The unknown is Ripple Effect (once known as DICE LA). This was the team that created Battlefield Portal for BF 2042, which transported classic Battlefield games, maps and modes into the new engine. A really fascinating side to the game that was one of the highlights from its launch. It’s not clear what they’re working on for the next Battlefield, but expect some kind of adjacent genre, as they say they’re looking to attract a new audience with this mode.</p>
