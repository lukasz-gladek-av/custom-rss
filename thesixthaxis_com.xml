		<p>The first content update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> is here, with Bugbear bringing the first additions to their crash-happy racer as it goes through Steam Early Access. There’s new cars, new tracks, and a bunch of new features and fixes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #01" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCjICG5QU-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In terms of tracks, there’s the new European rallycross track and folk racing track, Finncross. the European sports sedan, the Bravion, and American large segan, the Rammer, are both added as vehicles as well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a ton of fixes, optimisations and feature improvements. VRAM consumption has been released which, alongside, DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscaling and frame generation will all help to make the game perform well. There’s improvements for the server browser and being able to invite friends through Steam Friends List. We’ve got controller rumble, more granular FOV settings, improved AI and more.</p>
<p>You can find those patch notes below, but an updated roadmap promises another two tracks and two maps for June, leaving further content updates to be decided based on community feedback.</p>

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>
