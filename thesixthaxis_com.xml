		<p>Nintendo is revitalising one of their favourite multiplayer game concepts for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with GameShare, letting you share multiplayer games with other Switch owners, using just a single copy of a game.</p>
<p>This is different to PlayStation’s SharePlay, which streams a gameplay video to invited players, but is instead beaming game code to the other systems, letting them run the game on-device and with each player having a bespoke viewpoint, depending on the game.</p>


<p>GameShare will work both over local wireless and over the internet via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a>, but it will be more limited in that second scenario.</p>

<p>Locally, a Nintendo Switch 2 can share a multiplayer game with both Switch 2 and original Switch consoles (depending on the game), but GameChat is a Switch 2 exclusive feature, so online GameShare only works with Switch 2 consoles. Additionally, some games will only have local GameShare enabled and block online play.</p>


<p>Six Nintendo Switch games are getting upgrades to support GameShare on the Nintendo Switch 2, most of them free.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/11/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch-review/">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain-review/">Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> Switch 2 Edition – <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Paid upgrade</a>, and no GameChat sharing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a very different style of game. 51 Worldwide Games is packed full of boardgames, so each player can have different views of a chess board, for example. Treasure Tracker and 3D World are both isometric platformers from the Wii U with fully separate character control, while Super Mario Odyssey’s multiplayer is restricted to the second player being Cappy.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this concept many times in the past, whether it was the limited cable linked multiplayer of GBA games, giving small portions of games to those without a cartridge, or the same idea wirelessly with later handhelds like the 3DS – I think Tri-Force Heroes had this feature? – and it will be interesting to see just how extensively this is featured in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>
