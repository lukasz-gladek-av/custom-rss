		<p>November is The Simpsons month in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with a big collaboration and cross-over event that includes animated shorts, a whole new island, cel shaded graphics and a whole host of beloved The Simpsons characters to play as. That’s proven to be pretty darned popular, with Epic touting a big batch of new and returning players, to an extent not seen since last year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Welcome to Springfield - Fortnite | The Simpsons" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqQDlH9ztL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on <a href="https://xcancel.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624">social media</a>, Epic confirmed that “In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning Fortnite players since last holiday season. The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ Today in the US. Move over Shelbyville…”</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20251105">fortnite.gg</a> that amounts to a peak of almost 2.7 million concurrent players, though this figure needs a good bit of context. For one thing, the all-time peak player count is the 14.34 million that turned up for the Fortnite Remix: The Finale live event to close out Chapter 2 Remix on 30th November 2024. It also doesn’t mean the highest player counts of this year, which came close to 6 million in June and have had peaks for other events. Noting that it’s “new and returning” players means that it’s lapsed gamers, as opposed to those that will regularly drop in for a game or two. The real impact needs to be for the</p>
<p>Fortnite’s cel-shaded event has brought with it a month of Simpsons related content. The headline act is the 80-player Springfield Island, which is a “back-to-basics” battle royale experience, with each week bringing new themed gameplay, shop offerings and more. There’s tons of hidden easter eggs and gags in the game to find, including three bosses to find and battle.</p>

<p>Tying in with that are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games and streaming on Disney+ and on Fortnite social channels. The first short immediately jumped to the top of Disney+ charts, with a new short coming every Monday from 10th November, leading into new gameplay on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>These episodes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – “Apocalypse D’Oh”</li>
<li>November 10 – “Sugar High”</li>
<li>November 17 – “Multiplidiocy”</li>
<li>November 24 – “The Incredible Bulk”</li>
</ul>
