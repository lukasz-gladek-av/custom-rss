		<p>You will soon be able to sheath your Fortnite character in a Fantastic Four skin. These delightful creations are to tie in with the Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which can be seen in UK cinemas from July 25th 2025.</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four skins have not been detailed, but it is assumed that you will be able to purchase all four members of the team: Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and the Thing. Data miners have porked around in the code and found the details below, but nothing official has been posted.</p>


<ul>
<li>Reed Richards: – Skin, has a beard – Emote (With Prop &amp; Hologram) – Glider – Bundle</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Skin – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: – Skin (Normal &amp; Fire Style) – Emote – Emoji – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>The Thing: – Skin – Spray – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Epic have not posted a release date but it is assumed it will be somewhere near the launch date of the film. Galactus is the main villain in the movie, but it is rumoured that many lesser-known characters may make an appearance so they may get a Fantastic Four skin as well.</p>
<p>Data miners have also found reference to four pairs of Nike shoes that are linked to the characters, all of which are based on existing real world kicks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reed Richards:- Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: -Red and orange Air Max 95s</li>
<li>The Thing: – Orange Dunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four skins are the latest Superheroes to be added to the game,&nbsp; on July 10th a version of Superman based on the new DC movie starring David Corenswet was added to the game. Previous additions included Dead Pool, Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Blade, Harley Quinn, Batman and Spider-Man.</p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed the next entry into the Sudden Strike series with the announcement of Sudden Strike 5, which is due to come out in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To mark this announcement, Kalypso Media has put Sudden Strike 4 on sale until Sunday 20th July, with the base game and all the DLC available for $16. An announcement trailer for Sudden Strike 5 has also been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sudden Strike 5 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlNfzXuifFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Much like the previous games in the series, Sudden Strike 5 will be set during World War 2 and maintain the real time strategy gameplay. This entry will have 25 missions in the main campaign, and give players access to 300 units, with this split between 190 vehicles and 110 infantry units. Players can also select a commander that is best suited to their strategic thinking. During play, you will be able to see the whole battlefield from above allowing for better tactical planning as you look to capture and defend key resources including headquarters and supply depots. Sudden Strike 5 will feature online PvP multiplayer too, so you can face off against other commanders to determine who has the best tactical ability.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in Sudden Strike 5, a closed beta will be taking place through which players can test the game and provide feedback to the developers ahead of the full release next year. To sign up for the Sudden Strike 5 closed beta you need to visit the official <a href="https://www.kalypsomedia.com/sudden-strike-5">Sudden Strike 5</a> website.</p>
