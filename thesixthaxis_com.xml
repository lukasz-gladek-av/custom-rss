		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online in the US after being caught up in the TikTok ban that came into effect for a day at the end of the Biden administration, and developer Second Dinner has now said that they are looking for a new partner and publisher to ensure that the game is unaffected by any future trade wars and legislation.</p>
<p>Chief Development Officer and Second Dinner Co-Founder Ben Brode said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3lg7txo2bcc2j">BlueSky</a>:</p>


<p>WHEW. MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than answers. We appreciate your patience, but in the meantime enjoy playing MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to update with more information as soon as possible!</p>

<p>The TikTok ban, a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._7521"><span>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a>, wasn’t just about banning TikTok, but any app created, owned, published or controlled by Chinese tech company ByteDance, or other companies branded as foreign adversary controlled. While Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner is an independent studio based in California, the game is published by ByteDance subsidiary Nuverse.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/20/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/">takedown of Marvel Snap</a> came as a complete surprise to pretty much everyone – the developers included – and has seen the game removed from digital storefronts looking to comply with the law. Within hours, it became clear that service would be restored, off the back of comments from incoming President Trump saying that he would grant the companies a 90 day reprieve to sell TikTok or find some other workaround – he’d actually said this prior to the service being cut and the ban coming into effect, mind you.</p>

		<p>Just as we’re winding down in the UK a flurry of news drops through the virtual letterbox to keep us on our toes, and the first of these is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II’s roadmap. Developer Warhorse and publisher PLAION are obviously keen to let gamers know just what they can expect in the months following the game’s release on the 4th of February, when it arrives for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Roadmap Trailer (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC7NdeLnMjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most crucial thing, is that a batch of this content will come via free updates, meaning they’re not nickel and diming you for every little addition – a welcome relief in the current gaming sphere.</p>
<p>Seasonal highlights will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring: Enjoy a selection of updates, free for everyone, introducing a Barbers feature to customise your look, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a greater challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</li>
<li>Summer: Brushes with Death – Embark on a thrilling quest as Henry aids an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. Journey across the lands of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, facing perilous encounters and unravelling a web of dangerous schemes.</li>
<li>Autumn: Legacy of the Forge – Dive into Henry’s roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Work to restore a once-renowned forge and prove your skills in the art of blacksmithing as you uncover forgotten tales of the past.</li>
<li>Winter: Mysteria Ecclesia – Enter the Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue runs deep. Tasked with a covert mission, Henry must navigate the complex dynamics of the region, discovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these expansions will be a number of free quality-of-life updates to ensure that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reaches its full potential.</p>


<p>We’ve been lucky enough to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">make a start with the game</a>, and Gamoc is already deeply impressed with it, though it’s definitely not been an easy start for him. He says, “Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 seems like an uncompromising marvel. It’s slavishly devoted to realism and accuracy in a way that likely makes it a very niche game, as working out how to do things can be difficult and requires real attention and care. Then again, that was exactly what drew millions to the first game, and as those fans will attest, it’s also incredibly rewarding.” He continues, “The first time I finished a quest that involved combat without it feeling like too much trouble I physically punched the air in celebration, and when I finally reached the blacksmith, got a job, and forged myself a new sword I was grinning from ear to ear. This is a unique game that turns being a peasant in medieval times into an enjoyable experience. Ironically, perhaps.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/report-ncsofts-horizon-mmo-has-been-cancelled-before-it-was-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It looks like the latest casualty from Sony’s ill-fated live service push is NCSoft’s MMO based of Horizon Zero Dawn, as reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/">ResetEra</a>). The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/16/a-horizon-forbidden-west-multiplayer-game-has-been-confirmed-by-guerrilla/">live service Horizon game in development at Guerrilla Games</a> themselves, however, is currently unaffected.</p>
<p>Multiple projects at Korean developer NCSoft have been cancelled as part of feasibility reviews, including Project H, Project J and Project Pantera. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Leaked back in 2022</a>, Project H had been connected to another codename, Project Skyline, and also back to a partnership between Sony and NCSoft that was then confirmed in 2023.</p>


<p>Horizon was not named in this announcement, but was widely reported to be a spin-off to Guerrilla Games’ hit, looking to expand the franchise beyond core gaming audience and to a more casual mobile and PC one.</p>
<p>It’s not clear who exactly pulled the plug on the project, though you’d have to guess that, given that NCSoft has cancelled multiple projects, it is on their shoulders. The company’s Co-CEO even said, “NC needs to re-arm itself with the venture spirit it first started with. Let’s make 2025 a year of bone-crushing efforts with the mindset that if we don’t turn around by 2025, NC will never have a future.”</p>

<p>This is still also a dent to Sony’s ambitions within live service spheres, off the back of more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">cancellations of games in development at Bend Studios and Bluepoint Games last week</a>. Additionally, this could be seen as a ding to the Horizon franchise at large.</p>
<p>Having retired from PlayStation late last year, former SIE Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida has been doing the rounds, and commented on Horizon when speaking to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=xUPTxh0yNrDwTwEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=xUPTxh0yNrDwTwEo" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="1396370944115762967" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="Kinda Funny Games"><u>Kinda Funny Games</u></a>, saying that “The one I was a bit surprised [about] in terms of the number of units [sold] was the second Horizon game.”</p>
<p>He continued “Oftentimes, the second game does better because there are already millions of fans. […] I love Horizon and the game did well, and I was hoping that the sequel would do even better in terms of sales. The game was bigger and great, but I don’t think the second one did as many units as the first one.”</p>
<p>By all counts, Horizon Forbidden West sold well, it just maybe didn’t meaningfully outpace the original. Having launched in February 2022, Horizon Forbidden West had sold over 8.4 million units by April 2023 (13-14 months after launch), not too far removed from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-sells-7-6-million-copies-to-be-sonys-biggest-new-franchise/">7.6 million that Horizon Zero Dawn sold by its first anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The series has seen plenty of activity since then with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-review/">Burning Shores</a> story expansion later in 2023, the PC port launching in 2024, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn remaster</a> late last year as well. In an unexpected move, Sony also produced a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures spin-off</a> that launched across PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sony also announced a partnership to bring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Horizon franchise to the big screen</a> with Colombia Pictures – a division of Sony Pictures.</p>
