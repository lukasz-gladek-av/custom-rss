			<p>There’s a fair few VR platforming mascots that have come and gone, the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/03/super-luckys-tale-review/">Lucky</a> graduating to broader flatscreen adventure, leaving a gap for new heroes to fill. Enter the quite adorable, yet inexplicably named Max Mustard. Can he make the cut?</p>
<p><iframe title="Max Mustard Official Trailer | PlayStation VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_mfBhTzdAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with a large, tentacle-y alien robot kidnapping a bunch of adorable critters, called Mudpups. Just as it’s about to get its tentacles on you, Max Mustard turns up and scares it off, so you immediately team up with Mustard to fight off the alien’s various minions and save the Mudpups. By controlling Max with your robot-VR-controller hands. It’s a platformer, it doesn’t need to make perfect sense.</p>


<p>The platforming in Max Mustard is similar to that of his VR platforming predecessors. It’s essentially a classic platformer but rendered in a world that’s wrapped around you in 3D, so you can physically move your head to look around and follow the character through the world. There’s also more player interaction with the levels, whether it’s shooting guns with your actual hands, peeking around corners for hidden collectibles, that kind of thing.</p>


<p>You’ll accompany Max through four arcs, each of which has its own overworld map to work your way through, freeing Mudpups and collecting coins as you go. The platforming here is good, but not particularly notable. It does everything competently, but it doesn’t do anything particularly special. However, being a VR game does help make it more notable.</p>
<p>In addition to some of those coins and critters being hidden behind corners or other places that are easy to miss if you’re not careful, there’s also things like the plunger gun that you get very early on that turns a level into a platformer/shooting range at the same time, or the vacuum gun that allows you to suck enemies up and launch them at others.</p>
<p>There’s some nice touches without these specific tools as well, such as one area where two coins were definitely out of reach of Max, but I was pleasantly surprised when my random thought to just reach out and pick them up with my actual hand worked!&nbsp;The game also isn’t afraid to throw you off ledges mid-level either, or if you are foolish enough to pull the “Do not pull” cord in the van between levels, it shoots you through the roof for a bit before you fall all the way back down and land back where you started. Things like this just make me smile similarly to when it first handed me a plunger gun. It’s just fun!</p>

<p>It’s this combinations of VR and platforming where the game really shines, but there are a few great ideas sprinkled through the levels that don’t rely on it as well. One level was made of alternating platforms that changed every time I jumped, and another did something similar in time to the music – music that could be customised part way through the level with buttons to turn instruments on and off and it stayed that way for the remainder of the level. There’s also a few mini levels, such as shooting ranges for the plunger gun with some pretty tight time requirements to gain a Gold medal and a Mudpup as a prize, or the coin frenzy where you just jump Max through a stream of coins to try and collect as many as possible in a certain time. This latter one is particularly useful when it comes to buying upgrades, which you can do at an in-game shop and has a selection of upgrades for both Max and yourself. The first one was unlocking snap to turn, so you can turn your view with the controller instead of physically turning in real life – honestly quite ridiculous to have an accessibility or VR comfort feature locked behind a game upgrade – but then there’s also the spin attack for Max, faster move speed, an in-the-air dash attack, and so on.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty great, too. On PSVR2 it is crystal clear without a frame drop in sight, not even when you’re flying through the roof of your van suddenly. There’s plenty of details in the world and especially on Max, whose ponytail flutters about in their wake. The game’s aesthetic is pretty much what you expect for a platformer – it’s all bright a cutesy, even the enemies, and it doesn’t need to do anything more than that really. Most importantly, If you walk Max close to you they’ll look right at you and I challenge you not to say “aww” the first time it happens.</p>

<p>Throughout all this, Max handles almost exactly like Astro Bot, right down to jet boots which let Max float a bit in the air rather than double jump, except Max’s boots shoot flames rather than lasers. It’s clear that Astro Bot was a big influence here, but there’s more as well – there’s critters to rescue ala Sonic, you save them by breaking the under-sized cages they’re trapped in like Rayman, there’s bouncy crates with arrows pointing upwards similar to Crash Bandicoot, you choose what level to play via a overworld map with set routes like Mario, Basically, there’s a love for platformers and you see the breadcrumbs of that appreciation spread throughout the game.</p>
<p>This feeds into the only real problem with the game: it’s just kind of unremarkable. It plays well, it’s competently designed, it looks good, and gathers various ideas from other places and blends them into a game that is good and enjoyable enough, but it isn’t going to blow your mind either.</p>
<p>The only other negative really worth mentioning is that, when moving your head and moving Max at once, you tend to end up walking off in the wrong direction because it can be fiddly to judge the direction, as it changes based on your view. This is easy to adjust your playing style for, and only cost me three deaths.</p>

		<p>A long-awaited update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2">Warhammer: Verminitde 2</a> is here, with the Versus PvP mode now available to play after a free update. Not only that, but Fatshark has announced another free DLC level pack, Verminous Dreams, will be released starting in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Versus play has been a much requested feature in the Vermintide community, given how close in style it is to Left 4 Dead, which had an excellent take on PvP play.</p>
<p>That’s roughly what has been translated to Vermintide 2, with two teams of four facing off against each other, taking turns to play as the Ubersreik Five heroes and the Pactsworn, giving players five Skaven beasts to choose from, each of which has a specific ability – you’ll know them as the special enemies that you regularly face off against in PvE.</p>
<p>There’s a new set of challenges and rewards to go alongside this, designed specifically for and earned through playing Versus, but letting you show off in other modes as well.</p>

<p>Fatshark has also revealed that a new free DLC pack, Verminous Dreams, will be added to the game. This will feature three new levels, the first of which arrives for all platforms on 9th December, with the remaining two levels coming in early 2025.</p>

<p>While it originally launched in 2018 for PC, and has now been followed by the sci-fi fuelled Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Vermintide 2 has remained a fun co-op staple. We revisited Vermintide 2 back in 2022 and had a fantastic time once again. Jim said:</p>
<p>“Overall, Vermintide 2 offers a brilliant core game bolstered by years of updates, content, and support from its developers. That kind of passion hasn’t gone unnoticed by the Warhammer community, who eagerly await what may be coming next for the series. That said, those hoping to see Vermintide 3 in the near future may have a long wait ahead of them with Fatshark currently focusing its efforts on taking their four player co-op formula to the far future in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/15/warhammer-40000-darktide-delayed-until-2022/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. The team is no doubt hoping lightning will strike twice as they leave the fantasy world behind for this grimdark sci-fi setting.”</p>
