		<p>It’s been a busy old week at Gamescom, and while the show is still rumbling on for consumers, all the announcements, press and secretive hands on and previews have now been and gone. So, let’s wrap up a bunch of the biggest announcements and features that we’ve had through the week!</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andrewww</b> finished off the story of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, enjoying the fan pleasing touches at the end of the story, but won’t be able to go back and fully explore everything since he was playing via PS Plus. But he wanted more Star Wars, so he’s been watching Andor, and went back to the not-quite-as-good Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the bank holiday weekend, and check in as I work through a whole host of Gamescom previews.</p>
