		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is exiting early access and getting its 1.0 release on May 22nd, PLAION and Wired Productions has confirmed. The big announcement is that when the game launches, all microtransactions will be removed. Players who have been part of the early access period and bought the in game currency will be able to spend it through the in game store. The in game store is not going to be available for those who did not take part in early access. The general DLC model will replace microtransactions.</p>

<p>Game Director Chris Mallinson, of developer Caged Element, said, <em>“We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal – along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on GRIP. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks was going to be a free to play title funded by microtransactions, though that has obviously changed. The main move to being a paid title means that Caged Element can include player hosted games with custom rules, private games, a free roam mode, and remove the third party account requirement. As the game transitions from free to play to paid, the game will be offline from May 20th to May 22nd. The launch price will be $15.99, 15.99€ and £12.79.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/avowed-update-1-4-brings-arachnophobia-mode-to-the-living-lands-promises-new-game-in-future/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> Update 1.4, with an arachnophobia mode to turn all those eight-legged frights into strange colourful blobs with floating swords, while also giving a preview of what’s coming down the line with a roadmap.</p>



<p>I actually think that’s more freaky than a spider, but then I’m not aracnophobic…</p>
<p>Update 1.4’s other bullet points include enhancement for map exploration when you visit new areas, critter loot drops, passing time at camp and more.</p>
<p>The complete patch notes on the Obsidian <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-140-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forums</a>, but there’s the highlights below.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, and you can expect improvements to cooking and crafting, more NPC abilities and behaviours, new unique weapons and custom map markers this summer. You’ll have to wait longer to the autumn for New Game Plus, a photo mode, new weapon type and more character customisations, but they’ll be welcome additions.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Obsidian is working to localise the game for Korea and Japan, as well as improve the French localisations.</p>
<p>Here’s the cliff notes for Avowed Update 1.4:</p>
<p><strong>Map Exploration Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once most of a map’s accessible areas are explored, the fog of war will now fully clear.</li>
<li>Entering a city on an overland map (e.g. Northern Paradis in Dawnshore) will now reveal that portion of the map.</li>
<li>Increased radius for fog clearing as you explore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critter Loot Drops</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critters can now be defeated—and may drop loot!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Party Camp Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players can now wait at the Party Camp to advance time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved Soul Pod Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soul Pods now dispel illusions (except for Ryngrim’s entrance, which still requires Yatzli’s help).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Settings Options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chests now optionally appear on the minimap.</li>
<li>Power attacks with the Bow and Arquebus can now be canceled with a new setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avowed has been one of many highlights for Xbox and PC gamers this year (and PlayStation, to be fair), as Microsoft’s many studios and subsidiaries deliver on long-awaited projects, and as they’ve continually stuffed games into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>. “Avowed is an incredible RPG,” we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">our review</a>. “Its vibrant world and stellar cast make every moment a joy to take part in, enhanced by a script that gives equal measure to drama, action and humour. Coming hot on the heels of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Microsoft’s software revival is well underway.”</p>

		<p>Jade Raymond has departed Sony’s Haven Studios, the developer that she founded in 2021, with the development of their first title, Fairgames (stylised as Fairgame$) yet to be completed for PlayStation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">reporting by Bloomberg</a> digs into the situation surrounding her departure, stating that PlayStation leadership did not give Haven’s staff a reason for her departure, but that it came several weeks after an external test of Fairgames – according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apparently, the team at Haven are a bit concerned about how the game was received and its general progress.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed Raymond’s departure. “Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”</p>
<p>However, they are “committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey” and the studio will now have a pair of co-studio heads in the form of Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski.</p>

<p>Announced in 2023 and in development for PlayStation and PC, Fairgames is one of the many live service titles that PlayStation greenlit at the tail end of Jim Ryan’s tenure. We haven’t seen or heard anything about the game since it was revealed, arriving with a slick cinematic trailer that showed a multiplayer heist ’em up with PvPvE elements. In other words, it’s an extraction shooter, a high tech modern take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/12/hood-outlaws-and-legends-review/">Hood: Outlaws and Legends.</a></p>

<p>Jade Raymond is one of the best-known known individuals in the games industry, though mainly for the string of new studios that she has founded and ventures that she has led over the past decade. Having been a producer and then executive producer through the early years of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, she went on to work on the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/06/03/watch-dogs-review/">Watch Dogs</a> before moving on from Ubisoft. In 2015 she founded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/07/13/jade-raymond-founds-eas-new-motive-studios/">Motive Studios at EA</a>, intent on making Star Wars games in partnership with Visceral Games and Amy Hennig. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/ea-shut-down-visceral-games-moves-its-star-wars-game-to-another-studio/">We all know how that turned out</a>, but Motive did craft the single player for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> during her tenure and has become a core part of EA’s line up of studios.</p>
<p>Following Battlefront II’s release, Raymond left to join Google as head of Stadia Games and Entertainment… and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/29/google-stadia-shut-down-january-2023/">we know how that turned out</a>. Then, with fresh funding and backing from Sony’s push to make live service games, she founded Haven Studios, and got to work on Fairgames. While we don’t know Farigames’ fate, we do know how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">Sony’s live service plan has been turning out</a>…</p>
