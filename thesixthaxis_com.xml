		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>Whether this is a religious holiday for you or not, here’s hoping that you’re able to gather together with family and maybe a few friends, sharing time and merriment with as many of the loved ones in your life as possible over the next few days. Gifts will be exchanged, families with young children will have those flurries of chaotic excitement as wrapping paper is torn apart, and more than a few sweets and little tipples to fill the wait for Christmas Dinner!</p>
<p>So, on&nbsp;behalf of all the writers here at TheSixthAxis, I want to wish you, your families and your friends Happy Holidays and a very Merry Christmas!</p>
<hr>
<p>2024 has been another one of those years filled with challenges for many people and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With wars still raging in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we hope for peace and resolution, and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>
<p>These hopes might be fruitless , but if you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>

<p>While Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, if you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support. You can reach them via the above links or at the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samaritans – call 116 123</li>
<li>Shout – text SHOUT to 85258</li>
<li>Childline – call 0800 1111 between 7:30 and 3:30pm every day</li>
<li>Mind – call their infoline on 0300 123 3393</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s so many different charities and causes out there that you can support and,&nbsp;if you’re in a position to do so, we would encourage you to do just that.</p>

		<p>Who needs other people, eh? Sure they’re good for companionship, love and affection – and I suppose for a more effective Helldivers squad – but really, why not replace all that with a good old single player game? One that you can play on your own, whenever you like, and which won’t rely on anything other than your investment in it. OK, maybe I’m being flippant, but single player remains the bedrock of gaming, and after a number of years in the live service wilderness, they’re firmly at the forefront once more. 2024 has been a brilliant year for solo experiences, but one ran, bounced and boinged just that little bit harder than everyone else.</p>

<p>To call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> a love letter to gaming is to diminish its own creativity. Still, it is a missive filled with warmth and joy, not just for the PlayStation family and its beloved characters, but to the bountiful platforming abandon that’s normally a portly plumber’s remit. Just like Nintendo’s finest, Astro Bot is a repeated shot of delight that you will continue to down until you can’t possibly take any more, before finding room for just a little more.</p>
<p>Astro and his pals’ PS5-shaped spaceship is wrecked by some no-good aliens, leaving them strewn and stranded throughout the universe. Fortunately, our plucky hero sets out to rescue them within moments, leading to hour upon hour of platforming perfection.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> was a proof of concept to show off the PS5’s different abilities, Astro Bot takes that creativity and turns the dial way up, delivering you to tropical locales, sandy deserts and freezing tundras, where you fend off all manner of cute but deadly foes while encountering a new gameplay mechanic around every turn. It’s perky, cute and practically perfect in every way, and while you can share in its joy with other players, this is a classic singleplayer affair, making it a deserving winner of this year’s award.</p>

<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Atlus is renowned for the likes of Persona. When fourteen of the creative minds behind Persona left P-Studio to set up Studio Zero, it was obvious that whatever they made would be liquid gold. The first game they released is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>While Studio Zero is tasked with developing original IP and content unrelated to Persona, it’s fair to call their work Persona-like. Not only are there systems and mechanics that carry over, from the progression of time to the friendship simulator, and even the basics of combat, but there are some tremendous Easter Eggs that even the least eagle-eyed fans will spot.</p>
<p>Gameplay boils down to two things: a dungeon-crawling turn-based action RPG and a time management sim. The interplay between the two is very well built, offering huge flexibility in how you play the game. If you’re looking for a game you can easily sink 150 hours into, without getting bored of gameplay, you won’t go far wrong with Metaphor!</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Solitaire is basically&nbsp;<em>the</em> single player card game, and Balatro takes a healthy dose of influence from Solitaire in with its blend of Poker hands and an overarching roguelike structure. There’s no story here (outside of a slightly snarky Joker card commenting on your failure), just a pure, unadulterated tumble down a rabbit hole of Poker hands, modifiers and ever-growing scores to overcome.</p>
