		<p>Hasbro and Saber Interactive have announced a new partnership to develop a new AAA game from one of the toy giant’s “tentpole IPs”.</p>
<p>Given how big Hasbro is and how many toy ranges and properties they produced, that could be pretty much anything. Hasbro owns Dungeon &amp; Dragons, Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, GI Joe, Battleship, Risk, Jenga, and so, so much more.</p>


<p>Of course, Saber is now best known for their excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which launched to plenty critical and fan praise last year, and their surprising World War Z adaptation before then. We know their strengths as developers, and the technical prowess of their game engine to throw hundreds or thousands of individual enemies around on screen. It was great when used for a zombie shooter, and the perfect for depicting the Tyranids of 40K.</p>
<p>“We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I’m especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team’s games,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said in an earnings call. “Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024’s megahit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber’s Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.”</p>
<p>Joining all of the dots, the answer’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Saber is clearly making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/25/larian-boss-says-wizards-of-the-coast-not-to-blame-for-them-moving-on-from-baldurs-gate/">Baldur’s Gate 4</a>.</p>
<p>(Actually my money is on Transformers)</p>
<p>Answering questions, Cocks said that this would be a co-publishing deal, and that it’s specifically tapping the Space Marine 2 team to make the game – which was developed by the company’s main studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This sadly seems to reduce the odds of a Space Marine 3 happening, unless that project is already underway and the Hasbro collaboration scheduled to come after that.</p>
