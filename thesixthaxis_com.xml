		<p>It’s been a funny old week, when I thought that Wednesday was Thursday, thanks in part to a long day at a preview event on Tuesday throwing my internal calendar out of sync. What game, you ask? Well, I’ll tell you soon. We’ll also tell you what game Dom and I have been splitting up in co-op sometime next week, you can’t already guess what that is.</p>

<p>But there’s no guesswork for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">Two Point Museum</a>, which I had a lovely time reviewing for the start of the week. I do enjoy Two Point’s brand of management sim, and it’s always fascinating to see how each setting subtly shifts the style of the game, providing a canvas for all the base punning and nonsense that makes this feel so thoroughly British.</p>
<p>I mused the other day that Two Point Museum would be the perfect game to have a themed crossover with the huge game release of the week: Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds.<strong> Nic B</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Jim</strong> has also played Monster Hunter Wilds. The last of this trio said, “I found the main story quests to be a little too easy, so I’m hoping the endgame content will prove more challenging. My go-to weapon has been the Insect Glaive but once online servers go live at launch, I’ll be partaking in some Hunting Horn rehearsals!”</p>


<p>He’s also been playing A Plague Tale: Innocence, “which has been rattling around in the backlog for years. It’s an incredibly atmospheric medieval stealth ’em up that weaves together simple yet satisfying stealth sections and puzzles.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, quite obviously, been playing Destiny 2, <strong>Aran’s</strong> mixed things up a little with Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. The former was ‘fine’ until he ran into a progression bug later on, while the latter is “as silly as you’d expect it to be.” Sounds perfect!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a bunch of games, new and old on the go. In addition to his casual Phasmo and Palworld gaming, he was roundly disappointed by the Tomb Raider IV-VI remaster, and roundly satisfied by Avowed, “which is rather good in exactly the same kind of way as The Outer Worlds was.”</p>

<p>In addition to his continuing playthroughs of Immortals: Fenyx Rising and Sea of Stars, <strong>Ade’s</strong> also continued to have a great time fighting for freedom and liber-tea in Helldivers 2 this week –&nbsp;“There’s been some brilliant storyline developments added over the last few weeks; surely the payoff to all the drama will be the opportunity to battle on Super Earth itself?”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> played MiSide, and had a grand old time of it, while looking to sate his extraction shooter urges with Synduality: Echo of Ada. And he’s also played an odd bundle of Steam Next Fest demos, including A Gentlemen’s Dispute, Panic Delivery, Haste: Broken Worlds, and more!</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who dabbled with the opening of Avowed, but has put it on hold until he finishes playing through Eternal Strands. It’s Steam Next Fest, so you know that he’s been delving into the delights of horror demos, and then pairing that with some of the “slight but delightful” Princess Peach Showtime on his commutes.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

		<p>Raw Fury has announced that it is partnering with developer Christoffer Bodegård to publish the table top inspired CRPG Esoteric Ebb. Described as an absurd fantasy, Esoteric Ebb puts players in the shoes of a lowly cleric who is tasked with solving the mystery of an explosion that took out a tea shop in the city of Norvik. Much like table top RPGs, the cleric’s success relies on the roll of the dice and the advice and taunts of the six voices in his head.</p>
<p><iframe title="Esoteric Ebb | Partnership Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrdSKgd-1do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the story of Esoteric Ebb moves forward, players can choose to try and solve the core mystery or do anything to ruin the flow of the plot. The Cleric has some magical abilities that allow him to read and control minds, and detect secrets within Norvik. The dice rolling affects everything from stealing and fighting, to narrative choices. Failure is an option in Esoteric Ebb, and that will open up different avenues to explore. There are battles to take part in, with those being turn based and reliant on the dice too. How the Cleric’s playstyle evolves depends on the Questing Tree, which is a quest log, mind map, and skill tree combined into one tool. The playstyles change depending on the outcome of quests and how they were completed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">demo for Esoteric Ebb</a> is available on Steam until March 17th.</p>
