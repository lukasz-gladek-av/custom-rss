		<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has been revealed by Digital Sun, as a sequel to the 2018 game Moonlighter. In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money.

<p><em>“The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital Sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we’ve learned along the way. We’re channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that’s not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail”</em>, said Javier Gimenez, Digital Sun CEO.</p>
<p>Will will venture into vaults which become more dangerous the deeper he delves. He will have various gear and weapons available to him, that can be used to ward off enemies and secure treasures. The treasures he sells will fund the growth of Tresna as he supports other businesses. As they grow, Will will get access to more items.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>Following on from its appearance at the PC Gaming Show, 11 Bit Studios has confirmed that a demo for its survival game The Alters is now available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/the-alters-has-been-delayed-to-q1-2025/">The Alters was delayed to Q1 2025</a>, and at the moment it seems the game is on track to meet that release window. To mark the demo release a new trailer has been released for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters - PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiDOlqALAN4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>

<p>11 Bit Studios are experienced in the survival genre, having developed both Frostpunk and Frostpunk 2, as well as This War of Mine.</p>
