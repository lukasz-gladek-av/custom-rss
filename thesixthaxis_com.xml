		<p>Red Barrels has announced that it is partnering with Lionsgate to create a movie based on Outlast, with the game series writer, JT Petty, handling the writing of the screenplay. The Outlast movie is going to be produced by Roy Lee, who has previously been a producer on the likes of The Strangers: Chaper 1, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and IT. No actors have yet been confirmed for any of the roles for the Outlast movie.</p>
<p><em>“As die-hard fans of horror ourselves, we hold immense respect for Roy Lee and Lionsgate,”</em> said David Chateauneuf, Co-Founder and Creative Director at Red Barrels. <em>“Horror films, both classic and modern, have profoundly influenced our franchise, and collaborating on an Outlast&nbsp;film with true horror legends is a dream— or should we say, a nightmare—come true.”</em></p>


<p>Roy Lee also had this to say about the Outlast movie. <em>“When Outlast launched in 2013, it changed the landscape of horror gaming,” Roy explains. “Its deep, emergent lore provides the perfect foundation for a film that explores the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and dedicated fans.”</em></p>
<p>The Outlast series kicked off in 2013 with the original game, which was a first person horror game in which players took on the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explored the Mount Massive Asylum, which contained a lot of secrets and horrors to avoid and escape from. This was followed by the prequel Outlast: Whistleblower, in which players are Waylon Park, a software engineer at the asylum who gets the word out to Miles which leads to the events of the first game. Outlast 2 followed in 2017, introducing a new protagonist called Blake Langermann, another investigative journalist, who finds himself a poor rural area where a doomsday cult lives. The Outlast Trials is the most recent game, adding a multiplayer spin to the series.</p>
