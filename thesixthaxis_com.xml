		<p>Peak has been updated to version 1.50a in what will be the final content update of 2025 for the co-op climbing game. This update makes things feel festive and wintry with the airport getting Christmas decorations and some of the biomes getting a layering of snow, except Caldera as its too hot for snow to settle there. In addition, Aggro Crab and Landfall have stated that going forward updates will fewer, though more content is planned for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nacon RIG R5 Pro HS Gaming Headset Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/nacon-rig-r5-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>1385632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In recent years, the most reliable headset brand, at least for my ears, has been Nacon RIG. For years, their industrial looks have been married to high-quality gaming audio, and that’s seen them remain a firm favourite in our home. So, it’s with some surprise that the latest RIG headset, the R5 Pro HS doesn’t actually look like any of the headsets that have come before it. This much more restrained and customisable design still hosts RIG’s excellent audio, though, making this a late peripheral highlight in 2025.</p>
<p>The R5 Pro HS is a 3.5mm wired headset, meaning that it’s compatible with anything hosting a headphone socket, including PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s often nice to have the simplicity of a wired headset; you never have to remember to charge it, or place it on a dock, it’s just ready to go.</p>



<p>That simplicity extends to the R5’s controls, with an inline volume control sitting midway down the cable, itself boasting a slide control that clicks into place at full volume. It was always easy to find the control when I needed it, and I appreciated the fact that it was right there, whether hitting louder sections in a game, or needing to turn things down to hear somebody talking to me.</p>
<p>The microphone is similarly straightforward, with a flip-to-mute action that stops its output when pointing straight up. The boom arm is made of flexible metal with a rubberised coating, giving it a decent degree of movement and optimisation that sees it stay exactly where you put it. The mic itself boasts a 50 Hz–15 kHz frequency range, and it proved perfect for game chat and the odd Zoom call, though I do think I’d look for a dedicated mic if I was streaming and talking to an audience.</p>

<p>While there’s elements of the older RIG headset design language if you look really closely – you can see it in the squared-off bottoms of each earcup – Nacon have clearly decided to move towards a more modern and understated overall look. That means that the R5 Pro HS have lost some of the character of those older headsets, but you could actually wear these outside of your home without drawing any side eye. It’s clean, confident, and I like the shift in design as we head into 2026.</p>

<p>The R5’s little party trick is that it has customisable magnetic plates on the outside of each earcup, letting you add a touch of your own personality to them. It’s a decent enough idea, and one we’ve seen before with headsets like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2, but there, the support for different plates dried up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Nacon don’t want that to happen. Instead, even before their own options are available, they’ve released the STL files, letting those with access to 3D printing get started making their own plates straight away. This means that players will be able to create their own, completely unique plates, and I can see it being a popular headset, simply for this level of customisation. Out of the box, you’re getting two PlayStation-branded covers, but if you want to remove them, the R5 Spear Pro not only gets even lighter and easier on your ears, it gives it a real retro vibe that I definitely enjoyed.</p>
<p>Comfort isn’t an issue, with or without the plates, and the magnetic ear cushions – which you’ll also be able to buy alternate versions of – are thick, soft and plush. I was able to wear the R5 Spear Pro for days on end, helped by the ample padding on the headband, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, easy-to-live-with headset.</p>

<p>In terms of audio, the R5 Pro HS’s 40mm graphene drivers do a fantastic job of delivering all of your gaming needs directly into your ears, in suitably detailed form. I’ve been playing a ton of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>, and it was the ideal game to test them out with. The soundtrack, composed by Blood Cultures, had plenty of menacing thump, though the bass was never overwhelming. The R5 Pro HS are more bass-heavy than the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Atlas 200</a>, meaning that action games and bass-heavy music tracks have some serious weight.</p>
<p>If you’re so inclined, the R5 Pro HS are a decent option for listening to music as well. Besides mainlining the Skate Story Vol. 1 album, I’m still stuck on President’s King of Terror EP, and the aggressive guitars and electronic tones sounded great, with some decent spacing in the soundstage. They might edge towards the mid-range a bit more than some other headsets out there, but away from music, it means that dialogue and speech rings through that step clearer than elsewhere, and the wider soundstage means that you feel truly enveloped by the game worlds you’re exploring.</p>

<p>With an RRP of £69.90, the key competitor to the R5 Spear Pro this holiday season is the Turtle Beach Atlas 200, and it’s a tough battle as they’re both excellent wired headsets. The build quality of the R5 is definitely stronger, has better audio, and I much prefer the design, but the Atlas 200 probably just edges it in terms of comfort, thanks to its lighter weight. If you’re looking for customisation though, the R5 is the clear winner.</p>

		<p>If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see. Originally released in 2024, this hybrid RTS/autobattler – with a smidgen of deckbuilding – boasts some truly incredible art nouveau visual design. Characters, artwork, and the different unit classes, sing out from the screen, blessing you with their stunning, evocative looks. Luckily for us, the beautiful action doesn’t have to finish quite yet, with the huge Celestial Church DLC arriving today, bringing with it a host of much-requested features. </p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence: Celestial Church - Official DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mT-oJ5C8-a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The and biggest and brightest inclusion is six all-new singleplayer campaign chapters, the six-hour-long additions furthering the story and deepening Songs of Silence’s lore, bringing all that incredible artwork to life in a more meaningful way than ever before. </p>
<p>There’s then the addition of a new faction, the titular Celestial Church, who in turn have brought a host of new units, abilities and cards to bear on the battlefield. I can’t wait to test them all out in the coming days.</p>
<p>The expansion was shaped by recurring community requests for additional story-focused experiences. Throughout its development, Songs of Silence has evolved hand-in-hand with player feedback gathered from open betas, surveys, and daily conversations between the team and the community. It’s not about to stop here either, with Chimera confirming that another expansion is planned for mid-2026, accompanied by numerous additional features that will arrive beforehand.</p>

<p>“Players asked for deeper narrative experiences, and the Celestial Church expansion is our answer to that call,” said Songs of Silence’s Executive Producer, Hendrik Lesser. “We’re excited to keep enriching the game and delivering meaningful content for years to come.”</p>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/">Songs of Silence</a> at launch, and of course, I was utterly taken by the visuals, saying, “Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.”</p>
