			<p>Everyone’s looking for an edge, and in gaming, that can come down to the tech and peripherals you surround yourself with. Thrustmaster are one of the most reliable and long-running peripheral-makers in the game, and control has always been their calling card. Their all-new HEART Controller pulls together a raft of their knowledge, with Hall Effect analogue sticks and mechanical buttons designed to make this the fastest, most precise weapon in your arsenal.</p>
<p>The Thrustmaster HEART Controller – H.E.A.R.T. standing for Hall Effect Accurate Technology here – is a USB-A wired controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC. There’s a lovely braided wired cable which connects to the controller via a standard USB-C port. It boasts the traditional Microsoft asymmetrical stick layout, and it’s a wholly plastic build, appearing in black and white, with an RGB lighting strip running across the middle. It looks smart, if a little understated.</p>



<p>In the hand, it’s a lighter offering than the official Xbox controller, though that’s not that surprising with no onboard batteries to contend with. The hand grips are a touch more angular at the end, and noticeably so when you pick it up, but once they’re resting in the palm of your hand they’re as comfortable as you’d hope.</p>
<p>The analogue sticks are the stars of the show, though. Hall Effect sticks use magnets to track movement rather than physical connections that can wear out and cause drift. You can tell Thrustmaster’s expertise here, and they feel tight and incredibly responsive in use. I’ve played a heap of Overwatch 2 and Marvel Rivals with them, and you feel empowered by these sticks, firing off salvos with pinpoint accuracy. Well, as much accuracy as your thumbs can muster, anyway.</p>

<p>The mechanical face buttons and cross-shaped D-Pad are also excellent, with a great tactile feel and reassuring click when used. The Y button on our review unit seemed to take a little while to bed in, but I’ve had no issues with it at all in the thirty to forty hours since.</p>

<p>Now onto the weaker elements: the shoulder buttons and triggers. Both of these inputs feel cheap in comparison to those on the front of the HEART Controller. Some of that comes down to the light plastic that they’re made out of, but equally, the shoulder buttons, and particularly the one on the right, feels, and sounds, cheap. The triggers are certainly as responsive as you’d want, but I really missed the ability to lock them out for playing FPS titles like you can with recent controllers like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Pro</a> – admittedly a significantly more expensive controller.</p>
<p>There are two additional buttons on the rear, and you can program these on the fly using the mapping button on the controller. They sit really nicely under the fingers, and I just like the way they feel. In fact, they’re much better to press than those found on Thrustmaster’s pricier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">eSwap X2</a>.</p>
<p>The Mapping and RGB light buttons, though, are in the worst place possible. They sit above the Menu and Option buttons on the front of the controller and by doing so, they’re just where you expect to find the Menu and Option buttons. Every time I wanted to use either of the menu buttons, I found myself changing the lighting colour, or doing nothing at all. These absolutely needed to be placed somewhere else, and it seems unbelievable that no one else had the same issues with them during testing. I did mostly learn to live with it, but having to think about which one is the right button isn’t good for staying immersed in your game.</p>

<p>You can really tinker with the setup here though, whether on the fly – you can map the buttons and cycle through a small number of RGB lighting options via the buttons on the controller – or in the ThrustmapperX Software which is available on both PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>At £90, the Thrustmaster has to truly sell itself as being an upgrade over your regular Xbox controller, and though the analogue sticks, face buttons and rear buttons are well designed and feel great, the triggers and shoulder buttons just didn’t do it for me. In terms of competition, you’re one step away from Microsoft’s Elite 2 Core controller, but while it certainly feels more premium in your hand, there continue to be significant question marks about its reliability. I don’t think you’ll have any of those problems with the HEART Controller. If you want a wired controller for the reduced latency, that’s definitely a key selling point here, but if your budget will stretch to it, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2</a> is a far superior product, and you can now buy HALL Effect stick modules for it as well.</p>

			<p>While the cosy genre for some might mean a spot of farming or a touch of interior design, it’s tower defence that remains my calm, happy place. I’m not sure what that says about me, but it’s fair to say that IDUN – Frontline Survival puts you in that zen zone of constant watchfulness, laying down destructive towers while the hideous alien hordes attempt to overrun your defences. Ahhh, so cosy.</p>
<p><iframe title="IDUN: Frontline Survival - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eea98br6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play Security Officer Ham, who’s literally having a nap on the job when you’re introduced to him. This is the only rest he’s getting though, with a grotesquely rude awakening when vermin start to attack your mining post. You have to rely on your trusty flamethrower turret and Ham’s shotgun to make it out alive. There’s a cool sci-fi story running through IDUN’s tower-centric action, presented with great-looking character art to back it up.</p>


<p>The narrative drive helps to get you dug in with IDUN’s different mechanics, from controlling multiple hero characters, alongside moving and shifting your towers to deal with threats in the moment. As with the best tower defence games, IDUN forces you to face huge swarms of incoming enemies and hold them off, and it’s a lot of fun doing so.</p>


<p>The thing is, this isn’t so much a tower defence game as it is an RTS defence game. It merrily skewers the two genres together, and if you’re a fan of either it’s a winning combination that takes very little time to get you hooked. You move your towers and heroes as you need them, and it maintains a frantic pace that isn’t often found in the defence genre.</p>
<p>The only downside to moving your towers around is that you potentially lose some of the strategy and decision-making that you do when placing things permanently. In return though, I really like the addition of hero characters that you can use to plug gaps and turn the tide in your favour, and the increased pace lends IDUN – Frontline Survival its own feel.</p>
<p>There’s resource collection to think of too, and it’s often like spinning a very angry plate, balancing the need to control resource nodes while protecting your drilling equipment and base. Collecting enough resources unlocks upgrades mid-mission, from extra towers to permanent upgrades. This gives you a constant flow of improvements and decisions to make, and you have to hope that you’re making the right one to deal with the incoming threats.</p>

<p>Things can become a little too hectic at times, and there were moments where I lost my hero characters amongst the writhing enemy hordes. That said, it’s so enjoyable, that you can look past the occasional foible. You can call down additional artillery fire to give you a boost when things are looking desperate, and you’ll probably find yourself using it every single chance you can.</p>
<p>IDUN – Frontline Survival is no joke, pushing you to the limit in terms of enemy numbers and resources. On Medium difficulty you’ll be up against it by the third level, but in turn it feels really well balanced, and victory is hard won and rewarding.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your crew using resources won through successfully completing missions, increasing their health, range, fire rate and more. In addition to that, there’s a vast number of different turrets and additional weaponry you can install from your space station, keeping things interesting as you progress, and hopefully helping you through to the other side.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		IDUN – Frontline Survival is an RTS/Tower Defence hybrid that sells the concept incredibly well. While there’s a few rough edges, if you’re a fan of either genre, it’s an edge-of-the-seat blast. 	</p></div>
