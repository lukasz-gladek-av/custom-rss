		<p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a>, the pack-in multiplayer game for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil Village</a>, is shutting down this year on 29th June 2025. All DLC for the game will be removed from sale on 3rd March.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">In the announcement</a>, the team writes:</p>


<p>Thank you for playing Resident Evil Re:Verse.</p>
<p>This is to inform you that service will be ending for Resident Evil Re:Verse, which comes packaged with a purchase of Resident Evil Village for PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Steam. The application and all of its related DLC will no longer be available for download or purchase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release. Now that we’ve reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>

<p>We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologize for bringing you this disappointing news.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Re:Verse took the whole Resident Evil franchise, chucked it into a multiplayer game mode blender, and came out with a rather barmy blend of PvP multiplayer combat with Resi monsters in it. There was plenty of head-scratching for what this really added to Village, when Resident Evil 3 had featured an asymmetrical multiplayer mode, and this was a more straight up head-to-head multiplayer game with power-ups to transform you into Resi baddies.</p>
<p>Originally intended to launch right alongside RE Village in mid-2021, it was delayed a couple times until it finally launched in late 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/24/resident-evil-village-winters-expansion-dlc-review/">alongside the Winters’ Expansion.</a> While it was supported with a few content updates through a premium DLC pass, it holds a resounding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1236300/Resident_Evil_ReVerse/">‘Mostly Negative’ rating on Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>Kunos Simulazioni has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> patch 0.1.5, finally bringing online functionality to the racing game, almost three weeks after its initial launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>Now with the server backend live, elements like the car dealership, game economy, academy, car ownership and personalisation, as well as special events are now enabled. Also included in the update are a number of control and UI changes, there’s some track-specific improvements, and a smattering of other fixes elsewhere.</p>


<p>Up until this update, the game had been in a limited offline-only mode. At launch, as the servers first went offline, that meant players were restricted to just 5 of the Early Access release’s 20 cars, though as Kunos grappled with the situation, they released hotfixes that made all cars available to drive without earning them in-game. Alas, this was a game bitten by the issues that tying solo player progression to online server saves has, even though it’s a very common sight in all manner of other titles.</p>
<p>With this now restored, Kunos should be able to turn their focus to the first content drop, which will add two new cars, Fuji Speedway and more special events, and then the first major content and feature update.</p>
<p>Here’s the patch notes for Assetto Corsa EVO 0.1.5:</p>
