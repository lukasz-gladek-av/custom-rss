		<p>King of Meat is getting a closed alpha test in December, Glowmade and Amazon’s chaotic four player gameshow dungeon ’em up opening the castle gates to invited played on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> for a limited period of time – <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha">you can sign up here</a> for a chance to take part.</p>
<p>But what is King of Meat? Well, here’s where a handy new series of videos comes in, explaining the over-the-top medieval world, the co-op hack ‘n’ slash action, and how user generated content comes into the mix as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is King of Meat Episode 1: Co-Op Mayhem" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbFIZ1jlMB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place in the world of Loregok, King of Meat tasks players with completing quick dungeon courses filled with dungeons, trolls, skeletons and traps. But this isn’t actually back in the heyday of fantasy, because there’s all of the glitz and glamour of gameshow stardom, the hyper-capitalism of the modern world smashed into the fantasy setting.</p>
<p>You’ll have to work together with your team to overcome each room of enemies and traps, but at the same time, you’ll want to be the first among equals. On the other hand, you might want to instead be the best level creator out there, earning plaudits for your devilish creations as teams take them on.</p>

<p>You can really see Glowmade’s heritage shining through here, with the studio based in Guildford and featuring developers who previously worked on LittleBigPlanet at Media Molecule and Fable at Lionhead.</p>
<p>For the time being, Glowmade is keeping King of Meat testing private. This is a closed alpha test that is invite-only and will require you to agree to an NDA. Invites will be sent out on 3rd December, before the test gets underway on 4th December for a limited time.</p>
