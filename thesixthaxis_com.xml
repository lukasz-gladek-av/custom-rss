			<p>Nacon’s RIG line of headsets remain one of my favourite picks in the gaming audio landscape, and this year’s 600 Pro HS improved on all of their previous entries, particularly at its very competitive pricepoint. While it was already a great option, Nacon haven’t finished tinkering with it, and that means that they’ve just released a brand-new collab with plush ear-ware specialists Wicked Cushions. The result? A headset that’s even more comfortable, while rocking one of the most eye-catching paint jobs out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIMITED EDITION ACID CAMO RIG 600 PRO HS ft. Wicked Cushions | DUAL WIRELESS HEADSET" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iz-H2DcvxBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wicked Cushions business is making upgraded ear cushions for your headsets and headphones and making them more eye-catching in the process. That’s immediately evident in this collaboration, with the neon green highlights of the Acid Camo paint job extending onto the external edges of the ear cushions. It looks stunning, and if you’ve got a favourite headset it’s probably well worth taking a look at their website to see how their other designs could improve your worn-out and impeccably dull black ear cushions.</p>


<p>The external edges of the cushions are fashioned from leatherette, meaning that the 600 Pro HS’s already strong passive noise cancellation ramps up a notch, helping to form a very effective seal around your ears. Once you’ve got something pumping through them – I found the new Linkin Park album especially effective – you won’t be able to hear anything from the outside world. Perfect for immersion, and for appreciating whatever audio you’re into. The pads are also thicker, and the memory foam is firmer than in the original set, so they envelop your ear rather than sagging into it, though our original review pair may have taken something of a battering in the past ten months. Whatever the case, the new ear cushions take the 600 Pro HS’s comfort levels to a newfound level, placing them at the top of the sub-£100 bracket.</p>
<p>Swapping out the earpads in this way is certainly an unusual move for Nacon – maybe they’ve been eying Sony’s recent mid-generation upgrade of the PS5 Pro? – but when the results are as good as this it’s very hard to argue. They’ve taken one of my favourite headsets of the year and made them better, and that’s about as good as things get.</p>


<p><em>Our original 600 Pro HS Review continues below:</em></p>
<p>You can recognise a RIG headset from a mile off thanks to the one unchanging element of their lineup. The industrial design mimics a piece of steel girder wrapping around your head, and while that might sound a bit much, I’ve grown to love the style over the years. It’s not for everyone, but Nacon has done their best to make the range look sleek and modern. One thing the 600 Pro HS has in common with a steel girder is that it’s incredibly strong, with the plastic headband putting up with a barrage of twisting and stretching.</p>
<p>The only thing that does happen is that the earpieces pop out. That’s due to the RIG sizing system, which allows you to place the earpieces into one of three sockets depending on how much space you need, rather than having a sliding headband like many other manufacturers do. The big positive to this is that no matter what, you’re always able to get a consistent fit, and even if the earpiece does pop out while you’ve flung it in a drawer, they slot right back into place.</p>
<p>The RIG 600 Pro HS’ USB-C dongle works with the PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC and Mac – an Xbox version is also available – while its Bluetooth will connect to anything pumping out a signal. I had no problems pairing it to my Honor Magic V3, and it handily connects to calls when you’re playing if you have it set to Dual mode. There’s a physical call control button on the left earpiece, and this also lets you play and pause your music when you’re not taking a call, so if you want to play Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora while battering your ears with Sleep Token, you can.</p>
<p>The dongle itself is nice and small, and it’s perfect for use with the Switch or the Steam Deck while on the go. There’s a USB-A adaptor included in the box too, which helps if that solitary USB-C socket on your PS5 is already taken up by something else. I experienced no connection drops at any point, and Nacon’s technology on this front has proven to be spot-on in recent years.</p>

<p>The RIG 600 Pro HS uses a mobile phone app to tailor its functions, and once you’ve installed it – versions are available for both iOS and Android – you can dive into setting your headset’s EQ, microphone gain, mic monitoring and a few other secondary functions. The included EQ settings are limited, but there is a custom option, and if you opt for Expert Mode there’s a 10-point frequency scale to tinker with. It’s a great addition, and thanks to the Dual setting you can play and alter your EQ at the same time.</p>
<p>You will need the app as the on-board controls are fairly limited. Situated on the left earpiece there’s a power button, Bluetooth toggle, a cheap-feeling volume wheel and the aforementioned call control button. It would have been nice to have some form of on-board EQ control, but the ease of use and connection with the app makes up for this.<br>
Tailoring your EQ will mean you’re able to get the best out of the Nacon 600 Pro HS, and the 40mm drivers are as good as those in Nacon’s other recent RIG headsets. When playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora the ambient sounds of the alien landscape sounded clear and enticing, while explosions had plenty of bottom end rumble, particularly after I’d played with the 600 Pro’s EQ settings.</p>
<p>Utilising the 3D audio of the PlayStation 5, the 600 Pro HS was more than capable of delivering a convincing 3D landscape, with plenty of depth to the soundstage despite being a closed-back headset. The direction of gunfire in Avatar was also easy to discern, as was the arrival of my Ikran mount as it flew overhead.</p>
<p>Thanks to that adaptable EQ I found that listening to music with the 600 Pro HS was similarly enjoyable, taking the booming down-tuned guitars of Sleep Token and convincingly translating all of that depth and aggression. Vessel’s vocals retained their precision and clarity through the mid-range and there was plenty of detail to the top-end too, meaning that you can merrily take the 600 Pro on a trip – if you can get over the looks.</p>

<p>The Nacon 600 Pro HS sub-£100/€100/$100 price tag is only really visible in the cheaper plastics of the earpieces, and the workmanlike foldaway mic. That plastic does have the advantage of keeping the 600 Pro’s weight down, and this is a headset that you can comfortably wear for hours at a time without any fatigue. That’s helped again by the gorgeous comfort of the Wicked Cushions earpads.</p>
<p>At this pricepoint one of the main competitors to the 600 Pro HS is Sony’s own Pulse 3D headset, but you lose out on the Bluetooth connectivity which is a huge compromise. The 600 Pro HS will also keep you gaming for much longer, with its 18 hours of battery life handily beating out the Pulse 3D’s 12. The Nacon headset is also much more comfortable for long gaming sessions.</p>

			<p>Standing desks have become increasingly commonplace in not just offices, but also households as the number of people working from home becomes more widely accepted. Helping this along over the past few years, standing desks have become more robust, easier to set up, and thankfully, more affordable, with the FlexiSpot E7 range being an ideal choice for those wanting a more dynamic, adaptable home workspace.</p>
<p><iframe title="Next-Generation Height Adjustable Desk E7 PRO" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30fykTUEPmo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The reasons for upgrading to a standing desk are pretty apparent. Spending the majority of your nine to five grind ensconced in even the fanciest of office chairs can begin to feel uncomfortable, especially if you’re prone to worrying about bad posture and the general unhealthiness of being sat in the same spot for hours on end. Using a standing desk like the FlexiSpot E7 Pro won’t immediately help you get in better shape, though I found that having the option to alternate between sitting and standing helps to boost productivity while also encouraging healthier habits like regular stretching and being more active during screen breaks.</p>


<p>Working in this way can definitely take some getting used to, and there will be those of you who simply can’t put a finger to keyboard without having your bottom firmly planted on a chair. While primarily marketed as a standing desk, the adjustable height of the FlexiSpot E7 alone makes it a tempting upgrade for those wanting to better utilise their home office space, especially if they share a desk with someone who prefers a higher or lower work surface. As someone who is 6’4” (we’re all relatively massive here at TSA) one of my biggest frustrations when buying desks in the past is making sure my legs can tuck comfortably underneath, which has often resulted in the need to buy various furniture pads and risers. The FlexiSpot E7 Pro has been a silver bullet in this respect, allowing me to adjust its height to the exact centimetre required, also meaning I no longer have to worry about dimensions when shopping for desk chairs.</p>


<p>The desk arrives well packaged – every component was neatly nested in quality foam inserts, protected by layers of reinforced cardboard, the desktop and frame supplied into two separate boxes. The assembly instructions were far from exhaustive with 12 steps to follow and, all in all, it took just over an hour to go from cutting into the first box to having a state-of-the-art standing desk ready to go.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the building process was seamless. Although the components were clearly marked (it’s always nice to have screws and bolts in individually lettered bags) the assembly required a drill and some handy guesswork. For instance, the underside of the desktop was covered in small holes that would typically, when assembling furniture, denote where to place screws. Most of these aren’t used at all during the assembly, and are presumably meant for upgrades such as drawers or different sets of legs. There were also some holes that didn’t quite line up with the metal frame and others that needed drilling, which kind of goes against the whole flatpack/quick assembly ethos even if it wasn’t too technical a hurdle to overcome. With some tight fastening, the finished desk is incredibly sturdy with no wiggle room and a hefty weight that will require two people to flip once fully assembled. Or one very impatient person wanting a quick dose of searing back pain.</p>

<p>For those who may have slightly uneven surfaces in their home, the four attachable feet can help mitigate any potential lean or wobble. However, for a newly carpeted floor, I chose to skip this step and found the desk surprisingly easy to move and reposition despite its weight.</p>
<p>With three frame colours (white, black, and grey) and a diverse selection of desktop finishes and sizes to choose from (the largest being 2000mm by 800mm), the FlexiSpot E7 can be customised to fit any setting. Supported by super stable, 3-stage adjustable legs, it has an impressive weight capacity of 160 kilos which is more than enough to handle any work or gaming setup, while the concealed cable tray allowing you to efficiently tidy the accompanying jungle of wires and adapters.</p>
<p>In terms of height range, the E7 Pro can more than double in size from 635mm to a max of 1285mm. You can adjust the height seamlessly by using the keypad included, attached to the underside of the desktop, which also has a USB power slot ideal for charging your phone or other devices. When in motion, the desk glides quietly up and down with a satisfying smoothness that will have you regularly playing around with the keypad upon first use. What’s particularly good it that there are four programmable buttons to save preferred height settings, making it easy to switch between the ideal standing and seated heights for two people, as well as a handy child lock toggle.</p>

<p>The FlexiSpot E7 Pro isn’t inherently designed for gaming, though the same can be said of the office desk or television cabinet that you’re using to play PC and console games. The colour options available (particularly black on black) slot into the “gamer” aesthetic touted by other desk ranges targeting this demographic, and the adjustable height means that the E7 can be used in combination with any gaming chair without worrying about your legs getting pinned beneath the desktop or having your arms reaching for the keyboard and mouse at an uncomfortable angle.</p>
<p>As someone whose work day demands long stints of being handcuffed to a computer, the degree of adjustability is a godsend and, as previously mentioned, being able to shift between standing has led to untapped bursts of productivity. The desk won’t turn you into Joe Wicks overnight, though it definitely helps encourage healthier habits while working and gaming that are bound to have an ongoing impact on posture – FlexiSpot even sells a treadmill upgrade for those serious about burning a few calories.</p>
