		<p>Microsoft’s Q2 earnings call has provided a number of highlights for the Xbox gaming division, including strong game and Xbox Game Pass performance, but the most important statistic is that the company saw a 7% revenue decline, year-on-year, in large part because of a huge 29% drop in Xbox hardware revenue through the final few months of 2024.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has brought in over 4 million players across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this is an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5 in the first half of this year.</p>


<p>Microsoft CEO <a title="People > Satya Nadella [120 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/satya-nadella/">Satya Nadella</a> also touted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> as having a record breaking launch quarter, as it topped sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation, showing the value in multi-platform releases for Microsoft going forward.</p>
<p>Both of these launches fuelled a 30% growth in Game Pass subscribers on PC, which also indicates the potential of this subscription service, after a few years of slower growth than Microsoft had wanted. This helped Game Pass set a new quarterly revenue record, with the overall Xbox content and services revenue growing 2%.</p>
<p>However, in the quarter ending on 31st December 2024, the gaming division made $6.6 billion in revenue, which was a drop of $530 million year-over-year. That’s quite significant and revealing, as 2023’s figures had the massive bump of acquiring <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard in October 2023</a>, flooding the financial report with all the sales of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Diablo revenue. That helped to mask whatever else was going on with Microsoft’s gaming business through 2024’s quarterly reports, but we’re now seeing a meaningful comparison once again.</p>

<p>It’s really looking like Xbox’s decline as a console manufacturer is now irreversible, and little in Microsoft’s new multiplatform release plan is going to arrest that slide. The company has a huge deficit to PlayStation this generation, without the impetus of exclusive games, there’s little reason for gamers to really consider jumping to Xbox in future. Things could slide even further as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 releases later this year</a>…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/bioware-is-downsizing-mass-effect-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>BioWare Gnereal Manager Gary McKay has confirmed that the studio has been “downsizing” following the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year and prior to spinning up full development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mass-effect-4">the next Mass Effect game</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-production on a game typically requires a smaller core team, and McKay states that “[BioWare] are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare. […] Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio.”</p>


<p>That’s seemingly coded phrasing for job losses, though he does assert that “over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles”. Hopefully job losses alongside that have actually been minimal, and we hope anyone affected is able to find new work soon.</p>
<p>This is a sign of where the new Mass Effect game is at, and an indication that it will be several years away from release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/08/mass-effect-4-teaser-marks-the-return-of-an-old-enemy/">Having been teased back in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/07/bioware-tease-next-mass-effect-game-with-a-new-image/">and again in 2022</a>, we’ve known for years that a team led by Mike Gamble is in pre-production on the next game. We might have hoped that this would allow for production to scale up following Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s release, but it seems BioWare isn’t quite there yet.</p>
<p>While well received by critics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed EA’s expectations</a>, leading to a cut in financial forecasts – EA Sports FC 25 had a bigger share of the blame, to be fair. Additionally, BioWare released what seems to be <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">the last major update for Veilguard last week</a>, winding down active support to only bug fixes for game-breaking issues.</p>

<p>Here’s the statement from Gary McKay:</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare’s story. As we announced in <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/">August 2023</a>, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team at BioWare is developing the next Mass Effect game under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, and others.</p>
<p>In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p>
<p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p>
<p>Today’s news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare.</p>
