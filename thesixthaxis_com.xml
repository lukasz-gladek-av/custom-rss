		<p>There’s always at least one odd-ball game that Nintendo releases around the start of a new console generation, looking to take advantage of new controllers and inputs. For the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s Drag x Drive, and while it’s not filled with the same kind of ostentatious characters and flamboyant style, its all-new control scheme could make it the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now obviously they’re two very different games – ARMS was a third-person fighting game, while Drag x Drive is a gritty-looking take on wheelchair basketball – but they are both games that take the fact that you can very easily have two Joy-Con in hand, and then use motion controls and other sensors for inputs. They’re also a real physical workout for your upper body!</p>


<p>Drag x Drive is all about mouse mode, using the Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors in tandem with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the inputs disguises just how difficult this can be to get your head around manoeuvring a wheelchair. Placing the two Joy-Con edge-side down on the table to engage mouse mode – your trouser legs can probably do almost as well – you can propel yourself directly ahead by pushing both controllers forward. Push fast enough and you’ll hit maximum speed with little lights gleaming at the back of your chair. When you need to come to a halt, you engage the brakes with both triggers.</p>


<p>Straight lines are easy, but turning needs a bit of thought, as you push the left wheel forward (and the right wheel backwards) to turn to the right. Getting used to this is a bit like trying to figure out if you need to invert or un-invert your axis, or paddling a boat down stream by paddling on either side. Except, of course, here there’s a lot more pressure to spin yourself around, race up and down the court, and play B-ball!</p>
<p>Once you’ve run through the tutorial, Drag x Drive is all about 3v3 matches, passing the oversized ball back and forth between you and dodging past your opponents to get a shot at the hoop. This is as simple as lifting a hand and flicking the ball to try and score, or as complicated as racing up the quarter-pipe ramp at the end of the court to let you pull an audacious spinning slam dunk – something I couldn’t get the hang of in my limited time with the game. Pull off a cool dunk and you’ll get a couple bonus decimal points to your score, which can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>

<p>In defence, positioning and tracking back will be key –&nbsp;thankfully there’s always an on-screen indicator for where the ball is, while the camera remains fixed behind you – and the key defensive move is to ram into the ball-carrier and knock the ball free.</p>
<p>There’s all the regular rules of basketball at play here, so there’s 2 points awarded for a shot inside the half circle, and 3 points from outside, and there’s a shot clock as well, so you can’t keep hold of the ball for too long. Once it times out, the ball will just ping from your lap and give the other team a chance to grab it.</p>
<p>The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see.</p>

<p>Secondly, it’s all just a bit… drab. There’s some neon lights around the hoop’s backboard, and the scoreboard is built into the ramps on the end of the court in an attractive way, but everything’s just very, very grey. The court is grey, your wheelchair is grey, your character is wearing grey clothes and a grey helmet. Hopefully this is just down to the demo, because this game deserves and needs to have so much more character. There should be an arena set right in the middle of Rio de Janiero, a futuristic London or on Mars, your avatars should have an over-the-top hairdo and brightly coloured sports vests, and you should be able to race around to celebrate much more than just waving your arms around in real life.</p>
<p>Again, I hope we’re just seeing a tiny snippet of what this game can offer. With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could – <em>could –</em>&nbsp;be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.</p>
<p>Also, can we maybe get ARMS 2, Nintendo?</p>

		<p>The pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> have gone live in about as uncoordinated and messy a fashion as you could imagine, but here’s the good news up top: Argos currently has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">5th June</a> launch day stock at the time of writing (2:30 PM BST).</p>
<p>Head here for the Argos pages for:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550364?clickSR=slp:term:switch%202:1:346:1">Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundle (£429.99 + £3.95 shipping)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickSR=slp:term:switch%202:2:346:1">Nintendo Switch 2 (£395.99 + £3.95 shipping)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All other retailers are currently out of stock online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Kart-World/dp/B0F2T6WNG1?tag=eurogamer-ignuk-21&amp;ascsubtag=">Amazon</a> has concluded its invite-only pre-orders, while Nintendo’s own invite pre-orders are rather restrictive initially and could still be going out.</p>
<p><a href="https://ee.co.uk/products/nintendo-switch-2-with-mario-kart-world-bundle?referrerid=ZA00&amp;utm_source=awin&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_content=ZA00&amp;awc=3043_1744118942_0e55e468fc68e9672d91a5e76194d60e">EE</a>, <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/promo/nintendo-switch-launch">Very</a>, Shopto, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/nintendo-switch-2-256gb-console-with-joy-con-2-mario-kart-world-black/p113586930">John Lewis</a>, The Game Collection, <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-consoles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-pack/p/249606">Smyths Toys</a> and Game are all showing out of stock.</p>

<p>Currys is currently only taking pre-orders in-store, but might offer online pre-orders later (<a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/brand/nintendo/nintendo-announcement.html?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=206129&amp;awc=1599_1744118941_e8c8d29c26186fb9f5efd13f4cf8b253&amp;srcid=369&amp;xtor=AL-1&amp;cmpid=aff~Ziff%20Davis~Editorial%20Content~206129~IGN+International+UK+Ltd&amp;sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=206129">register your interest here</a>). It’s worth trying to call up your local store if you’re going to try heading down.</p>
<p>While pre-order stock was always expected to move quickly, just as with any kind of new and desirable electronics, the rollout of pre-orders in the UK was pretty haphazard. Alongside the Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 last week, Nintendo announced that their own pre-orders would go live today, 8th April, using an invite lottery based on having had at least two years of active Switch Online, and with priority given to those who play more Switch games than others.</p>
<p>However, they seemingly did not try to restrict other retailers and push them to go live at the same time. Amazon instituted their own registration and invite system that kicked off last week, while most retailers opened up full pre-orders last Thursday and Friday, and ran through their allocation.</p>
<p>We expect that pre-orders will periodically reopen over the coming days, weeks and months, as Nintendo’s supply chain is able to provide more consoles over time. This might not be for the launch date on 5th June, but successive waves of stock.</p>
<p>It’s also plausible that, depending on how things shake out in the US, American stock could be redirected to other regions. US Switch 2 pre-orders have been postponed following the announcement of Trump’s import tariffs on goods from almost everywhere in the world. With Nintendo Switch consoles primarily manufactured in China, but also Vietnam and other countries in Asia, there’s huge 30+% tariffs that would be applied. That could get even bigger for goods produced in China, as the country has pushed back and imposed retaliatory tariffs, which Trump has promised to re-retaliate against.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a> last week, Nintendo said:</p>
<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Other countries are unaffected for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders… but our stock markets are also going haywire.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/jackbox-party-pack-11-standalone-trivia-murder-party-3-are-coming-in-late-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox games have revealed that Jackbox Party Pack 11 is set to launch in late 2025, another bundle of new multiplayer party games to play with your best (and worst) buds and family. Additionally, Trivia Murder Party 3 is being spun off into a standalone game, set to launch into early access later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Party Pack 11 preview | Coming Fall 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHey83S46Sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After taking a year off from the yearly launches of Jackbox Party Packs to experiment with some other ideas – a smaller naughty pack and then a standalone trivia game, Jackbox Party Pack 11 is getting back to the traditional format of the long-running series.</p>
<p>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A fantasy-themed trivia game</strong> where teams collaborate to defeat trivia-obsessed monsters.</li>
<li><strong>A social deduction game</strong> that puts each player on trial, where clues are based on facts players share about themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A head-to-head joke writing game</strong> where players “ruin” wholesome concepts under the direction of a “bad to the bone” host.</li>
<li><strong>A sound-based game</strong> featuring new Jackbox technology where players record themselves and compete to make the best sound effects.</li>
<li><strong>A cozy drawing game</strong> where players create simple designs based on bizarre prompts. (Warning: May induce hunger!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So party, so pack, am I right?</p>

<p>What’s also quite exciting is that Trivia Murder Party 3 is set to be spun off into a standalone game, a sequel to the fan-favourite minigames from party Packs 3 and 6, featuring online matchmaking for the first time. This means you can play locally or online using traditional Jackbox Games room codes, but also just match up with total randoms for a bit of a trivia showdown. Trivia Murder Party 3 is set in a summer camp as players try to outwit and escape a serial killer.</p>
<p>This will be available for PC via Steam and Epic in fall 2025, before coming to other platforms in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trivia Murder Party 3 standalone teaser | Early Access Fall 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEOkKZr1Dqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> was a bit of a bum note for the series, we only have to look back to 2023 for the most recent high with Party Pack 10. Jason said in our review, “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">Jackbox Party Pack 10</a> is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Repackaging tech demos and putting them on sale is nothing new to the game’s industry, but Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour has proven controversial to say the least, though mainly for the fact that there’s a price tag –&nbsp;any price tag –&nbsp;for its collection of informative mini-games, quizzes and other little tidbits.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour – Gameplay Video – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lc9a52fM2UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That price tag is, admittedly, only $10. The first thing that sticks out is the presentation, with Nintendo clearly having put a lot of thought and effort into how to draw all the disparate ideas and information together. The isometric view, the scale of the tiny people walking around the gigantic Nintendo Switch 2, the way that different parts of the console have been repurposed into museum stations – the analogue stick being an info desk, for example – all of this is absolutely on point. It’s exactly how you might construct a science museum… if you had an infinite budget, that is.</p>



<p>Across the left Joy-Con 2, we quickly ran up to the first little mini-games, which look to showcase two of the key features of the controllers. Mouse mode is front and centre here, with a spiked ball-dodging minigame where you move a little UFO through the free space between dropping balls, trying to survive for as long as possible. Right next to it was an HD Rumble 2 minigame, where you try to pinpoint the exact spot on a frequency finder where the rumble is at its strongest – my best effort was just 3 points away, but I’m sure I could nail it with another couple of goes.</p>


<p>It’s not all minigames on here, though. Talking to people milling around give you little tips on how to get the most out of Welcome Tour, like telling you how to run, and there’s more basic show-and-tell style demos, like using HD Rumble to simulate the feel of bead-filled maracas and a maraca with just one single ball in it. You can shake them around, switch modes, and shift from a full 3D model maraca to a wireframe that shows the innards.</p>

<p>And then there’s the most directly informative elements, little stations that you can visit and break down the specifics of how the HD Rumble works, how magnets are now used to lock Joy-Con 2 into place, how the optical sensor on each controller works with a view of the surface its tracking that’s lower resolution than even a Game Boy Camera, but which polls this a thousand time each second. Oh, and yes, there absolutely is a test on all of this, with quiz stations dotted around the embiggened console.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, all a bit rote. HD Rumble isn’t new technology, and it was popularised under a different brand with the iPhone 7’s Taptic Engine, optical mice are decades old, and magnets? Look, magnets are pretty darned neat, but…</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see just how far this invention goes in the full game. Our time ran out just as we reached the frame rate test, with the Switch comparing different frame rates together and getting you to pick which is higher, but there’s also one with demos including what a pixel-perfect Super Mario Bros. would look like on a 4K screen – hint, it’s tiny – how the mouse can be combined with gyroscope, and more.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look too far back in time to find similar tech demo-like bundles with 1-2 Switch or PlayStation VR Worlds, and those were priced a good bit higher than the $10 that Welcome Tour will cost. Even so, the question will remain if Welcome Tour is worth it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, that will be up to you. Even though Astro’s Playroom was bundled in for free with the PS5, setting the bar for pack-in game experiences, there will have been millions upon millions that never even loaded it up. On the other end of the scale, there will be those who are fascinated by how technology works, all the thought and effort that goes into putting them together, and this more museum-like approach that provides plenty of reference and framing for will be right up their alley.</p>
