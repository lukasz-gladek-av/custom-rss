		<p>It’s been a funny old week, when I thought that Wednesday was Thursday, thanks in part to a long day at a preview event on Tuesday throwing my internal calendar out of sync. What game, you ask? Well, I’ll tell you soon. We’ll also tell you what game Dom and I have been splitting up in co-op sometime next week, you can’t already guess what that is.</p>

<p>But there’s no guesswork for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">Two Point Museum</a>, which I had a lovely time reviewing for the start of the week. I do enjoy Two Point’s brand of management sim, and it’s always fascinating to see how each setting subtly shifts the style of the game, providing a canvas for all the base punning and nonsense that makes this feel so thoroughly British.</p>
<p>I mused the other day that Two Point Museum would be the perfect game to have a themed crossover with the huge game release of the week: Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds.<strong> Nic B</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Jim</strong> has also played Monster Hunter Wilds. The last of this trio said, “I found the main story quests to be a little too easy, so I’m hoping the endgame content will prove more challenging. My go-to weapon has been the Insect Glaive but once online servers go live at launch, I’ll be partaking in some Hunting Horn rehearsals!”</p>


<p>He’s also been playing A Plague Tale: Innocence, “which has been rattling around in the backlog for years. It’s an incredibly atmospheric medieval stealth ’em up that weaves together simple yet satisfying stealth sections and puzzles.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, quite obviously, been playing Destiny 2, <strong>Aran’s</strong> mixed things up a little with Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. The former was ‘fine’ until he ran into a progression bug later on, while the latter is “as silly as you’d expect it to be.” Sounds perfect!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a bunch of games, new and old on the go. In addition to his casual Phasmo and Palworld gaming, he was roundly disappointed by the Tomb Raider IV-VI remaster, and roundly satisfied by Avowed, “which is rather good in exactly the same kind of way as The Outer Worlds was.”</p>

<p>In addition to his continuing playthroughs of Immortals: Fenyx Rising and Sea of Stars, <strong>Ade’s</strong> also continued to have a great time fighting for freedom and liber-tea in Helldivers 2 this week –&nbsp;“There’s been some brilliant storyline developments added over the last few weeks; surely the payoff to all the drama will be the opportunity to battle on Super Earth itself?”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> played MiSide, and had a grand old time of it, while looking to sate his extraction shooter urges with Synduality: Echo of Ada. And he’s also played an odd bundle of Steam Next Fest demos, including A Gentlemen’s Dispute, Panic Delivery, Haste: Broken Worlds, and more!</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who dabbled with the opening of Avowed, but has put it on hold until he finishes playing through Eternal Strands. It’s Steam Next Fest, so you know that he’s been delving into the delights of horror demos, and then pairing that with some of the “slight but delightful” Princess Peach Showtime on his commutes.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/esoteric-ebb-to-be-published-by-raw-fury-become-a-cleric-in-this-crpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Raw Fury has announced that it is partnering with developer Christoffer Bodegård to publish the table top inspired CRPG Esoteric Ebb. Described as an absurd fantasy, Esoteric Ebb puts players in the shoes of a lowly cleric who is tasked with solving the mystery of an explosion that took out a tea shop in the city of Norvik. Much like table top RPGs, the cleric’s success relies on the roll of the dice and the advice and taunts of the six voices in his head.</p>
<p><iframe title="Esoteric Ebb | Partnership Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrdSKgd-1do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the story of Esoteric Ebb moves forward, players can choose to try and solve the core mystery or do anything to ruin the flow of the plot. The Cleric has some magical abilities that allow him to read and control minds, and detect secrets within Norvik. The dice rolling affects everything from stealing and fighting, to narrative choices. Failure is an option in Esoteric Ebb, and that will open up different avenues to explore. There are battles to take part in, with those being turn based and reliant on the dice too. How the Cleric’s playstyle evolves depends on the Questing Tree, which is a quest log, mind map, and skill tree combined into one tool. The playstyles change depending on the outcome of quests and how they were completed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">demo for Esoteric Ebb</a> is available on Steam until March 17th.</p>

<p>Promise Mascot Agency! is an open world mascot management crime drama, where you play as a disgraced Yakuza lieutenant called Michi. He is sent to the bankrupt agency and is tasked with turning it into a profitable business, which is a lot harder said than done when the location is a small town called Kaso-Machi. The gameplay will consist of exploring Kaso-Michi, recruiting mascots, and sending them on jobs around the area. Sometimes, these jobs will go wrong so Michi will have to find solutions to get them back on track.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/paradise-killer-review-pc-switch/">Paradise Killer Review</a></h2>
<p>Kaizen Game Works previously made Paradise Killer, and in our Paradise Killer review, Miguel wrote, <em>“Paradise Killer is a pure, unguided detective mystery that doesn’t dare hold your hand. You, and you alone, are in charge of seeking out not only the truth of this locked room murder, but the truth of the wild and cosmically corrupt world that the game takes place in. The open ended nature of the investigation can be daunting at first, and while some clunky platforming and frequent periods of downtime can sour the experience just a bit, Paradise Killer still manages to be one of the most well put together and utterly satisfying mystery games I’ve ever experienced.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/playerunknown-productions-drop-the-first-gameplay-trailer-for-procedural-survival-prologue-go-wayback/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the most exciting projects we’ve been able to check out recently has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/prologue-go-wayback-playerunknowns-glimpse-of-a-digital-future-that-teaches-us-to-survive-in-the-present/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. There’s a whole host of reasons as to why it’s exciting, but the first amongst them is that it’s coming from PlayerUnknown Studios, the development team headed by Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene, known globally for the smash hit battle royale PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds, or PUBG. This new trailer is the first true taste of the game’s gameplay outside of our press viewing and selected beta testing. You should definitely join us in the excitement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Prologue uses procedural generation and machine learning to create an 8km by 8km map every single time you play. For context, that’s the same size as Skyrim’s map, and just as with Bethesda’s RPG hit, if you can see it, you can walk there. In fact, that’s the whole point of the game. Your task here is to survive, with each iteration of the map liable to cause you immense stress and strain as you fight against the elements, and your own hunger and thirst. You have to stay warm, dry, fed and watered, and that is far harder than you might first think.</p>
<p>Your task is to make it to the weather station. Each time you drop into the game you’ll start in a cabin, and the weather station will be somewhere between 3km and 6km away. There’s no mini-map, or route finding, you have to use an in-game physical map that your character holds up to read, while then referring to your compass to choose the direction. Just as you would in real life if you were lost in the woods, you have to navigate by the monuments and landscape details that you can see, finding other shacks or cabins along the way that hopefully contain better clothing or additional food to keep you going through the night.</p>


<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the perfect survival game, and it can really look quite beautiful, assuming you’re able to survive long enough to see it. Prologue: Go Way Back will release into Early Access this summer for PC.</p>
