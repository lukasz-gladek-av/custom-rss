		<p>Ubisoft have posted a picture of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell on their official Twitter feed along with a pair of eyes, some lips and the tag #SplinterCell.&nbsp; The series has been a favourite of fans for many years but the last game was Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist which launched in 2013, so it’s about time for a new game, right?</p>
<p>Well, probably not, in fact it’s perhaps more about Lady Gaga as she is headlining Tudum, Netflix’s yearly fan show that highlights up-and-coming films and tv series. You will have almost certainly forgotten that in July 2020 Netflix and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/">announced an animated show based on the game.</a> The Ubisoft post on Twitter is just ahead of this year’s Tudum, which will start at 1am BST on May 31st, 2025.</p>


<p>At the time a report on Variety suggested that two seasons comprising sixteen episodes in total had been greenlit. Derek Kolstad, who is one of the key writers behind the John Wick films. had been linked as an executive producer and writer for the series.</p>
<p>A trailer for the series was released eight months ago, you can watch it below.</p>

<p>However, there’s a small chance Ubisoft are going to reveal something about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">Splinter Cell Remake</a> that they announced way back in 2021 and have not said a thing about since then.</p>

<p><em>“Ubisoft has greenlit the development of a Splinter Cell remake that will draw from the rich canvas of the brand. Led by Ubisoft Toronto, the game will be rebuilt from the ground up using Ubisoft’s own Snowdrop engine – the same engine being used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, as well as Ubisoft’s upcoming Star Wars game – to deliver new-generation visuals and gameplay, and the dynamic lighting and shadows the series is known for.”</em></p>
<p>Creative Director Chris Auty, Producer Matt West, and Technical Producer Peter Handrino took to the Ubisoft to answer some questions.</p>
<p>“A lot of time has passed since the original Splinter Cell, and even since the last sequel – enough time to miss an entire console generation,” explains Peter. “So now we’re going to take the time to explore what this means for us, for light and shadow, for animation tech, for gameplay, AI, even audio. We’re going to ask ourselves, “where does it make sense for us to innovate?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to be straddling the line between the spirit of the old, and the comfort of the new, so that we can excite and surprise new players, but also make sure that when our returning players pick up the controller, they have that sigh of relief, saying “Ahhh, they got it.”” concludes Matt.</p>

		<p>CD Projekt RED has revealed that it will be releasing another update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt later this year, and that this update will add cross platform mod support. This update will allow players to create and share mods across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with all mods being available as free content. The release of this update is part of the celebration of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s 10th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — 10th Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The mod update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will require a little bit of work from players to use. If you want to access mods you will need to set up an account on<a href="https://mod.io/">&nbsp;mod.io</a> and link your CD Projekt RED account to it. Those on PC can still use the likes Nexus Mods and Steam Workshop, but console players will need to sign up to mod.io to use the modding function. Additionally, if mods are being created that use scripts will require REDkit too, but mods that change things like textures will not require REDkit. Mods will not be creatable on PS5 and Xbox Series XS.</p>
<p>A release date for the mod support update for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>This is it. The last week without a Switch 2. I am actually incredibly hyped – way more than I have been for the past couple of console launches – and I think it’s because of one thing: Mario Kart World. We’ve basically been playing the same Mario Kart game for 11 years. Yes… 11! Don’t get me wrong, those have been some great years, and Mario Kart 8 has been tweaked, updated and added to across that time, so it’s not the same game. But… it is the same game. Mario Kart World is a totally new take on Mario’s kart racing franchise, and I can’t wait to check it out.</p>
<p>The other nice thing is that there are fewer launch games for me to pick up here. I’m always an idiot and buy too many things at launch, and then none of them get played properly, but there’s a small batch that I’m interested in, having played other games elsewhere. I do wonder how that will play out for third parties, and whether they’ll see the return they’re hoping for with legacy titles, but here’s hoping it doesn’t put them off from bringing more Switch 2 games to the table.</p>
<p>This week, I’ve been playing a few things, going from Doom: The Dark Ages to a bunch of different sized wheels in Warhammer 40,000 Speedfreeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">Roadcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">F1 25</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing Chains of Freedom for review, Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, and Oblivion.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been probably been playing Destiny 2 this week, but he’s also been writing about a batch of other things that he’s going to tell you about, including Hell is Us, which he seems rather taken with. You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/hands-on-hell-is-us-preview/">read his preview right here</a>.</p>

<p>After jetting off to Madeira for most of the week, <strong>Aran’s</strong> gaming was limited to starting Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon for review. He says, “So far I have escaped a dungeon and killed a miniboss found in a hidden dungeon in a blood-filled lake.” Sounds delightful!</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Hypercharge: Unboxed but says it is “more fun in concept than it is in execution”, calling it, “A pretty by-the-numbers arcade shooter that’s fun for a short while”.</p>
<p>That’s not all he’s had on the go though, as he tell us, “After chipping away at it for a couple of weeks, I also crossed Resident Evil 8 off my backlog. I really enjoyed the setting and many of the smart refinements Capcom has made to the series’ new formula. Presenting players with a cast of twisted villains, then tasking us with taking them down works great just as it did in Resi 7. However, much like its predecessor, there’s a jarring theme shift between atmospheric horror and sci-fi that I wasn’t a huge fan of.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been carrying on this week. Specifically with&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is “a great RPG with memorable characters, an engaging story, and superb combat but irritating platforming sections” and continued to enjoy Revenge of the Savage Planet in co-op with his partner.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been Revenging that Savage Planet, saying, “It works really well in the transition to third person”. He’s also rinsed Doom the Dark Ages, telling us, “It was a fun campaign but the pacing felt off in places. I’ve had the chance to try out a few demos early with previews on the way and really enjoyed Near Mage – review up soon. Finally as a result of the early demos I’ve been trying to beat the NES Ninja Gaiden games and my God they’re tough. Resisted save state scumming so far but don’t think that’ll last much longer.”</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been doing some prep work for the impending arrival of the Switch 2 next week. That’s meant going all the way back to the PS4 to capture some Yakuza 0, Cyberpunk 2077, Kunitsu-Gami and more for comparisons – Cyberpunk on PS4 is such a rough time… He’s also dipped into the Splitgate 2 open beta, which is a pretty good time while everyone’s still figuring out how to best use portals, jet packs and everything else.</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>
