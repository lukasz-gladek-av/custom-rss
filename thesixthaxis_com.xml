		<p>Around a year after its debut, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> is getting its biggest update yet, with a big update for the existing experience (now rebranded as LEGO Fortnite Odyssey) and a whole new social roleplaying game LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Both will be available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> client later this week on 12th December, with LEGO Fortnite now a permanent unique category for all the modes and UGC within.</p>

<p>Let’s start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it’s up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you’ll look for Storm Dungeons to take on – these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There’s some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You’ll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier – Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor – Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer – Make sure crime doesn’t pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel – Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef – Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista – Serve Brick Bay’s most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller – What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that’s in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there’s the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>
