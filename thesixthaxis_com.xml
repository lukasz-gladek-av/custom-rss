		<p>Semiwork has announced that it is looking at what to bring in the next big update for R.E.P.O, and the studio wants the players to give their input on what they want. Players can leave comments on in the comments on YouTube or through the <a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Frepo">R.E.P.O Discord</a> In addition, Semiwork is working on a hotfix following the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/r-e-p-o-gets-10-new-monsters-in-its-monster-update/">&nbsp;Monster Update</a> that was released last week. One of the things that will be added in the R.E.P.O hotfix will be an Arachnophobia Mode, as well as some enemy tweaks.</p>

<p>Semiwork has also announced that there will be a short break when it comes to R.E.P.O videos so the team can have a bit of a rest. The break will not be that long with information to come when the team has decided on what direction to go with for the next R.E.P.O update.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

		<p>Blue Dot Games has announced that following its Next Fest demo, ’83’s early access will now be releasing in 2026 and not this year as originally planned. The extra time will allow Blue Dot Games to address the issues raised by the players when playing the ’83 demo, including the UI, gunplay, and movement amongst features that will be addressed.</p>
<p><iframe title="'83 – Steam NextFest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t72zJNyJt_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Blue Dot Games wrote, <em>“Following overwhelming feedback on the Steam Next Fest demo, we’ve made the decision to shift our Early Access release of ’83 out of 2025 and into early 2026. We believe in ‘83 and are committed to doing what’s best for both the project and our community.&nbsp;<wbr>We’re using this additional development time to focus on key areas the community told us matter most:&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gunplay and feel&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Optimisation and performance&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Graphical fidelity and visual polish&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Overhaul of the UI&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Movement and animations&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>General stability and bug fixes&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The demo gave us a vital snapshot of how ’83 plays in the hands of a broad range of players, and we’re taking all of that data and feedback seriously. Our goal is to deliver an Early Access experience that reflects the ambition of the project, but more importantly, something you genuinely enjoy playing and want to return to. On top of the key areas listed above, we are also working hard to correct and improve our models for weapons, uniforms, gear and vehicles where the need for improvements has been identified.&nbsp;<wbr>Thank you again for your patience, enthusiasm, and for holding us to the highest standard. We’re listening, and we’ll be back with more updates as we continue building ’83.”</em></p>

<p>’83 is a 40v40 squad based first person shooter set during an alternate history where the Cold War erupted into full on conflict, with NATO and the USSR battling across Europe. Players can choose which side to play on as they battle in matches that will last 30 to 40 minutes, while players who take the Commander role will have an overview to help guide their sides.</p>

			<p>You can really feel the Super Smash Bros. coming through in Kirby Air Riders. The distinctive tone of a Masahiro Sakurai game is clear to see, from the menu UI, to the iconography of the collectables, and the general gameplay ethos. With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-kirby-air-riders-direct-just-revealed-so-much-stuff-top-ride-amiibo-online-demo-and-more/">first Global Test Ride demo event</a> kicking off this weekend, and ahead of a release later this month, I had a fresh opportunity to play this game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Road Trip opening video (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5iu4lOM37w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having already gone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands-on back at Gamescom</a> in August, I was much better prepared for what Kirby Air Riders actually is. At first glance, it appears to be a follow cam racer in the vein of Mario Kart, but from the style of the racing to all the other modes that are featured in the game, it’s really nothing like Nintendo’s main kart racer.</p>


<p>For one thing, your vehicle just starts driving with no input from yourself, and the game will even (as I remembered from August) tell you off if you push forward on the analogue stick. Thankfully, I had far fewer visual slaps on the wrist this time around, and I quickly got back into the groove of this one-button racer. You really just have to concentrate on turning and pressing the context-sensitive B button, which will cause you to slow down and drift, gobble up incidental enemies, and batter any nearby rival racers with a Copy Ability that you’ve picked up.</p>


<p>There’s a few exceptions to this simplicity, with a spin attack needing you to waggle the left stick, and pulling back and forward to fly and glide from any ramps. Oh, and your character’s special ability is unleashed by hitting Y. And that’s basically it, though there are some more advanced techniques to learn, such as pumping the brakes to drift through corners without losing speed.</p>
<p>I got to put this to the test once more through the standard Air Ride mode, racing through three courses –&nbsp;the grassy meadows of Floria Fields, the almost biblical sea-splitting of Waveflow Waters, and the charming sunset ride of Mount Amberfalls. The racing is pretty rapid, with plenty of tight corners, the odd side route, and the three tracks having different numbers of laps depending on their length. Waveflow Waters felt particularly manic, as you could easily crash through the water walls of some sections and end up in the wet stuff for a few moments, and there’s some cinematic grind rails and jumps that pull some unexpected moves with the camera.</p>
<p>Revealed during the jam-packed Kirby Air Riders Direct a couple weeks ago, there’s also top-down racing with the Top Ride mode, but I feel that the real heart of this game is in the City Trial and the vehicular combat party game vibes that it gives off.</p>

<p>This was something I was utterly unprepared for during my first hands on –&nbsp;I didn’t play the GameCube original and hadn’t seen the first Direct for this game – but knowing more of what to expect, I could get into the swing of things a fair bit more. There’s tons of characters to choose from, each with their own special ability, and they can be combined with a bunch of vehicles that all have distinctive characteristics, but you have to go and find the vehicle you want when starting off in City Ride.</p>
<p>You’re basically just racing around and running into as many pick ups as possible. No need to be too discerning about what you grab, as they all go to boost your vehicle’s stats… unless they’re greyed out debuffs that you need to try and avoid instead. Skyah is a deceptively compact-feeling map with a ton of secretive feeling paths between the various locations and layers to explore, and the action is constantly mixed up by having portals to drive through, and then the big Field Events to try and draw players together. These can be things like a mini race, a huge pillar to collectively try and destroy, gigantification, or teleporting you all to a dustup derby arena for a knockout battle.</p>
<p>What’s startling is just how much the speed and action ramps up through the few minutes that you’re racing around in Skyah. If you’re sat a bit too close to the screen (as we were), it can be genuinely a bit disorienting just how quick you end up going.</p>

<p>And then, as time is up, you have the other pretty unique distinction of being able to choose the final challenge that you face in the Stadium. Four of these final modes are presented to you, and instead of voting and everyone being lumped together from that, you can actually just go and do the thing you want. If you’ve ended up with a machine that has been built for combat instead of speed, you probably want that Dustup Derby instead of a straight up race, while your more agile vehicle might help with dodging lasers, a better flier will be better suited to Air Glider or High Jump, and there’s some 90s game show classics like trying to hit scores markers on a big wall.</p>
<p>I feel that Kirby Air Riders, much like its forebear, is destined to gain a cult following. There’s a deceptive simplicity to the game that can make it accessible, and that can enable the more chaotic side of the game in City Trial. It’s also clear just how much passion Masahiro Sakurai and the team have for this game. It might not be for everyone in quite the same way as Smash Bros. is, but it’s certainly worth finding out if it is for you with the online tests over the coming weekends.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/07/turtle-beach-racer-wireless-wheel-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Steering wheels have to be one of the most inconvenient of gaming peripherals. There’s cables dragging everywhere, clamps for nearby tables or desk that never quite sit right, or the space needed for a full stand or seating rig, if you’re truly going to commit. Equally, there are few add-ons that make games as gratifying to play. Hurtling around a race track while you feather the real-world throttle, using your paddles to gear change, all the while fighting against the bucking realism of force feedback, can make you feel like a virtual Colin McRae or Max Verstappen. If you’re into racing games, they make themselves more or less essential.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Racer Wireless Racing Wheel Trailer (All-In-One Race Setup)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgYiX1GEsqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Turtle Beach know all this, and with the Racer Wireless Wheel for Xbox, PC and Android, they’ve tried to make a steering wheel that’s easier to live with. It’s one that’s designed to slot into your gaming life – and your living room – with a practised ease, parallel parking its way into your heart. Largely, they’ve achieved that.</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll think when you grab it out of the box, is just how good it feels. This is a premium-feeling wheel, despite coming in at £139.99/$179.99. It is largely made from a combination of matte and gloss black plastic, with some rubberised grip sections on the left and right of the wheel, but it’s solid, clean-feeling plastic, centred by a bright yellow cut-out at the top of the wheel, to provide a modicum of colour and pizazz.</p>


<p>While most wheels immediately have you looking for the nearest desk or table edge, the Racer Wireless Wheel gives you more options, starting with some metallic lap tray inserts. These slide into place at the bottom of the wheel, and you lock them with the same rotating mechanisms on the top of the device that you use for the deck clamps. The underside of the curved metal has rubberised grips, and once you’ve got it set in place on your lap, it mostly stays where you want it to be, thanks in part to the grips and thanks in part to the pleasing amount of weight in the main body.</p>
<p>The weight plays a role in making the Racer Wireless feel like a premium product, but it certainly helps it to behave more like a traditional wheel, even when it’s not attached to anything. Thankfully, you can lock it into place in a table with the simple clamps, and things feel exactly as you’d hope they would with it secured in place.</p>
<p>Serious racers will then ask, where are the pedals? The answer is, there aren’t any, with the Racer Wireless wheel dealing with accelerating and braking by mapping it onto some analogue paddles. You’ll notice that this completely does away with manual gear shifts, but it’s best to remember just who this wheel is aimed at: casual racers who want to feel more connected to their racing games. For that, it does a great job, injecting fun and a dose of realism in equal measure.</p>

<p>The lack of pedals makes the setup that much more streamlined and simple to use as well, and it makes the Racer Wireless a unique option. There’s an accessibility angle here as well, where this control set up makes it more suitable for games with &nbsp;a disability or injury that would make pedals difficult or impossible to use.</p>
<p>Across the face of the wheel, you’ll find all of the central inputs you need, and they feel solid and well-made – particularly the D-pad. I had no problem cruising through menus and making changes to the options in Forza Horizon 5, and other than the occasional moment where you might lose the touch memory of where some of them are, like the dinky shoulder buttons, they do exactly what you need them to do.</p>
<p>There are two customisable function buttons on the left side of the wheel, which can replicate any of the other main inputs, as well as a multifunction button that opens up the Racer Wireless’ other abilities, particularly its audio controls via the 3.5mm socket. You’re getting a full suite of Turtle Beach audio options, including four EQ’s and then various adjustments to mic monitoring and the like, though you’ll need the app to get to all of them.</p>

<p>You can make a bevy of adjustments to the wheel’s performance via the Turtle Beach Control Center 2 app – available for both Xbox and PC – from updating the firmware for both your wheel and the wireless dongle, to digging into the nitty-gritty of the wheel’s setup. I made the change from 360-degree rotation to 180-degree here, and it made a huge difference to my interactions with the wheel, as it felt so much less cumbersome to turn when not attached to a desk.</p>
<p>You can also alter the input levels for both the left and right paddles, and the wheel itself, adjusting deadzones for all three, as well as choosing between standard, precision and fast response times. I found that Fast suited me well enough, and made the Racer Wireless feel massively responsive, if a bit twitchy at times. It’s great to have that level of granularity though, in something that is more or less aimed at the more casual racer.</p>
<p>In keeping with the more casual, no-frills approach, there’s no force feedback or vibration, but you might not miss it once you start hammering around the track. Without those features, the Racer Wireless is capable of up to 30 hours of battery life, and that played out in our testing. In fact, it also holds onto its charge remarkably well too, and after returning from a week’s holiday, it had lost just a couple of percent.</p>

<p>The clear thing that was apparent from my time with the Racer Wireless wheel, was just how much fun I was having. It isn’t a one-to-one recreation of driving – far from it – but it does make racing games like Forza Horizon 5 come alive when you’re comparing it to a controller. It’s straightforward, and nearly as easy to pick up and play with as a regular controller. While I did once lose the 2.4Ghz dongle, there’s a handy slot in the base to keep it in when not in use, and you can always opt to go wired instead.</p>
<p>There was the occasional niggle. The selector switch at the side gives you two Xbox options, one for a wheel, and one for a controller where there’s no steering wheel option, but in F1 2025, it wouldn’t recognise either for driving the car. There is a sturdy list of supported games for both Xbox and PC, but F1 2025 isn’t currently listed, despite the previous two entries being there. Here’s hoping that more games are added in the near future.</p>

		<p>OwlCat Games has released the main theme song for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, with the theme being composed by Paweł Perepelic. It has quite the epic sound to it and does capture some of that The Expanse feeling, delving into something that seems hopeful and inspiring but ending slightly on a mournful note. Have a listen for yourselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn — Main Theme" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PqNeoff3NI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn:</p>
<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>

<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
