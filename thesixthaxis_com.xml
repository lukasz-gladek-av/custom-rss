            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/fortnite-is-back-on-the-ios-app-store-in-the-us-and-it-seems-quite-popular/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After almost half a decade of legal wrangling, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is back on iPhone and iPad via the iOS App Store in the US, and has also been restored to the Epic Games Store and AltStore in Europe. Not only that, but it’s now right at the top of the App Store’s Free Games category as gamers rush to download it to their phones.</p>
<p>It’s been a dramatic couple of weeks in the land of Apple, as Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers found that the company was not abiding by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-app-store-anti-steering-rules-must-change-but-dont-expect-fortnite-back-on-iphone/">her 2021 ruling on anti-steering restrictions</a> in the App Store – these prevent developers from linking out to websites and third party payment systems, which Apple was technically allowing, but with prohibitive fees still associated, and with Apple enforcing scare sheets on outward links. In breach of this court ruling, Judge Gonzalez-Rogers determined that Apple now cannot put any fees in place for external payments, which immediately saw the likes of Amazon Kindle and Spotify add links out to their websites.</p>


<p>Fortnite was a different matter, though. Apple dragged their feet, saying that they are appealing this latest ruling and didn’t want to let Fortnite on the App Store in the meantime. Epic, meanwhile, submitted the app through their Swedish developer account and when this, as a single global app package, was rejected, complained to the judge. Judge Gonzalez-Rogers laid down an ultimatum and Apple has now relented.</p>
<p>Fortnite is back on iPhone and iPad, but only in the US App Store where this ruling applies, and through the third party Epic Games Store and AltStore app stores which are available in Europe thanks to the Digital Markets App.</p>
<p>In the US App Store, Fortnite now has purchase options both through Epic, where they entice players to use their purchase system by offering 20% bonus rewards, and with Apple’s standard in-app purchase system.</p>

<p>This all started when Epic sneakily added third party payments to Fortnite in the App Store, breaching the terms of service and getting kicked out because of this, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/25/fortnite-app-store-ruling-apple-unreal-engine-injunction/">giving them an excuse to sue</a>. For a long time, it looked like this had completely backfired, the company losing almost all counts that they were suing on. However, Apple overplayed their hand on the one count that they lost on, demanding a 27% fee from any linked-to payments, when compared to the 30% standard cut they take on the App Store. Epic called them out on this to the courts, and after some stark revelations from discovery about internal meetings and decision making, Epic got their biggest win yet, potentially releasing Apple’s stranglehold on their platform.</p>
<p>But it’s not quite over yet. Apple is appealing the ruling every which way that they can, and has asked for a stay that would let them revert to blocking external payments while the appeal plays out. In either situation, if Apple gets their way, then external payments will likely change or go away very quickly, and Epic will have to make a choice over if they would comply.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/sony-is-shutting-down-its-playstation-stars-loyalty-program/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation Stars reward program is coming to an end, shutting off access to new users today, and with a rolling shutdown that will see it fully closed by November 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/14/sony-announced-playstation-stars-loyalty-scheme-with-digital-rewards-not-nft/">Launched in 2022</a>, the two main hooks for PlayStation Stars were the ability to earn digital collectables themed around popular PlayStation properties and franchises, as well as the typical loyalty scheme fare of PlayStation store top ups and vouchers.</p>


<p>It seems that this really didn’t strike a cord with enough people, as the company is now shutting the program down. Personally, I never really “got” what PlayStation Stars was meant to be about. The push for digital collectibles doesn’t speak to me, and the main allure of loyalty programmes like this and Microsoft Rewards is more to do with getting shop vouchers… but that felt like a secondary</p>
<p>“Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to,” wrote Grace Chen, &nbsp;as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.”</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for PlayStation Stars users? Well, the program will still continue to work for the time being, but new members cannot sign up for it. Sony is also no longer going to produce new rewards for it, and everything will kind of be in stasis after July. The program will fully end in November 2026, but PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles after this point… somehow.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting today, PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program.</li>
<li>If members choose to cancel their PlayStation Stars membership starting today, it will not be possible to rejoin this version of the program, and members will lose all earned Points.</li>
<li>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status until July 23, 2025 at 7:59AM PDT | 3:59PM BST | 11:59PM JST. After this date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars Campaigns available, or any additional rewards or status benefits to earn.</li>
<li>This version of the PlayStation Stars program will fully end on November 2, 2026 and current PlayStation Stars members can continue to redeem Points as long as their Points don’t expire before then.</li>
<li>PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles, even after these changes take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the next attempt goes better and is more actively rewarding.</p>
