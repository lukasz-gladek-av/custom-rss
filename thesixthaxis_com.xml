		<p>Nintendo has shared a fresh 15-minute look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in a dedicated Nintendo Direct stream. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive kart racing sequel is coming out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">alongside the new console on 5th June</a>.</p>

<p>The Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct gave us a deeper dive into what this new entry in the long-running karting series will offer. From the game reveal a couple weeks ago we already learned about the larger 24-player races, the shift to an open world that’s filled with race circuits that you actually race between as part of many Grand Prix events, the new Knockout Tour mode, and plenty more.</p>
<p>There were also plenty of teases in the trailer, subsequent Treehouse Live showcase and hands on events, such as snacking on food to unlock new character costumes – they transform you mid-race but are then unlocked for the rest of the game – rail grinding and wall-jumping, new water vehicle transformations, the ability to commandeer some world vehicles, and more.</p>
<p>The Direct runs through the basics, such as picking characters and karts, each of which combines to give different stats for when you head out on track, much like in Mario Kart 8, the structure of Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, the menagerie of items new and old, and plenty more. There’s new additions like Kamek, who can transform rivals, and, yup, you’ll still get the more powerful items when you’re towards the back.</p>

<p>Similar to Mario Kart 8, newer players can use smart steering to help stay on track, or tilt controls (including with a Joy-Con 2 wheel) to make things harder. New features when racing include the Charge Jump – hold the drift button while going straight to jump up – which is great for dodging incoming attacks, hopping up onto grind rails and wall-riding. You can also Rewind, to roll your position back and let you redo a stretch of a race, perhaps to master a particular trick or jump – other drivers are not rewound though, so don’t use this too much or you’ll end up dead last!</p>
<p>Beyond Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, a standalone custom race you have more control over the race you take part in. You can choose to race a particular track three times round in as is standard, or do a point-to-point race style by racing from one track to another. This even lets you create races that you don’t get to experience in the main game modes.</p>
<p>Battle mode has also been confirmed with a showdown where you have five balloon lives, use items to try and knock out other players’ lives, and the last player standing (driving?) wins.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring the open world in Free Roam, you can look out for P switches that will start particular missions while driving around, such as collecting blue coins or heading to checkpoints.</p>
<p>The game supports four player split-screen multiplayer and up to eight players in local wireless play, while up to 24 players is limited to online play. Here you can party up with friends while free roaming – meet up with your crew in the world map and then cruise around together, battle and race.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game at the first Switch 2 hands on event earlier this month, and had a great time checking out the expanded races, the point-to-point Knockout Tour, seeing all the new characters and falling in love with the ability to race as Cow.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/mario-kart-world-preview-can-nintendo-revolutionise-the-karting-world-again/" aria-label="“Mario Kart World Preview – Can Nintendo revolutionise the karting world again?” (Edit)">Mario Kart World Preview – Can Nintendo revolutionise the karting world again?</a></h2>
<p>Chatting about the Knockout Tour, I said, “Knockout Tour is one long cross-country race, with checkpoints to blaze a trail towards and the final four drivers to reach that point being eliminated. From twenty-four racers at the start, it will chop the field down to just four by the time you’re racing for the win. It ramps up the pressure in a very different way, and the sheer number of players, the volume of pickups going off makes for some seriously topsy-turvy moments as you tumble from 5th to 19th and the cusp of getting completely knocked out as you come to the next time gate.”</p>

			<p>Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds launched a rather stomach-churning 12 years ago, a game which I’m sure many have fond memories of, playing with friends, enjoying its silly enemies and simple action. I’m sorry to say that, given the wealth of newer beat ’em ups released since then, it’s not held up all that well. But what’s this? A remaster? Can spruced up graphics and some gameplay tweaks save the day?</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKWLg6wW6k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is now the version of the day, a remaster of the original game with added characters and moved into Unreal Engine 5, so things are shinier, and you’ve got more options in the co-op and versus mode. I do like that the online co-op lets you play with up to six players, which can potentially lead to pure chaos on screen.</p>


<p>The versus mode feels a bit tacked on in games like this, and that’s especially true here as the combat mechanics just aren’t deep enough to make you want to keep hopping in and testing yourself against your friends. To say that most of the combat here is button-mashing would be vastly underselling the amount of button-mashing you can do in Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate.</p>


<p>Technically, you’ve got light, medium, heavy, and special attacks, along with a few movement options and some ultimates as well. In most levels though, you’ll be just hammering one of those wondering when things are about to end. Despite this, there’s fun to be had here because of the incredibly odd enemy design and the generally good feeling of levelling up, but it’s short-lived. If you’re playing alone, you’re most likely going to lose interest pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It’s all just a bit flat, and the story, despite being completely unhinged and involving dimensional travel, isn’t especially inspiring either. It’s all slightly better-looking and it runs smoother than it used to, but unless you’re an absolutely rabid die-hard fan of the original game, that’s really not enough to pit it against more modern takes on the beat ’em up genre like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a>.</p>

<p>I really wanted to enjoy this game more than I did. Reviewing a game you’re excited about but then don’t get on with is, frankly, rubbish. All that excitement just sort of ends up disappearing into the void, and instead of getting a nice pay-off, you get a bit of sadness. It’s not great, you know? Despite my best efforts though, I just couldn’t enjoy this game.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is a renewed take on a beat 'em up that probably felt a little outdated back when it launched in 2012, and while the revamped graphics and the engine are both nice, they're not enough to make this feel like a game that's really worth sinking your time into. It's a fun five minutes or so here and there, but it's just not doing enough to really make it an enjoyable time.	</p></div>

		<p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is here, and it brings another big batch of free content, including a new PvE Operation and a new Tyranid boss, the Trygon which lends the update its name. There’s also plenty of new PvP content, season pass additions and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Trygon Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oAHVCnAXxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new PvE Operation, Extraction, tasks you with reaching the Adeptus Mechanicus facility on Avarax, figuring out where the Tech-Priest is that is refusing to extract, and try to get them out of there, if they’ve survived so far. Along the ay you’ll face off against the Trygon, a huge burrowing Tyranid that creates underground passageways for other Tyranid to us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you can now earn Prestige Ranks in PvE – visit the Armouring Hall once you’ve reached level 25 and activate prestiging from the Skill Tree screen – there’s private PvP lobbies, a new Inferno Pistol secondary, new customisation options, and updates to the weapons, weapon perks, matchmaking and a bunch of other bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>For Season Pass holders, there’s the new Space Wolves Chapter Pack and Imperial Fists Champion Pack to let you customise your look in even more ways.</p>

<p>See all of those in the full patch notes:</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p><b>New Operation — Exfiltration</b></p>
<p><i>Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that&nbsp; creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms.</i></p>
<p><b>Private Lobbies in PvP</b></p>
<p><i>A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes.</i></p>
<p><b>Prestige Ranks in PvE</b></p>
<p><i>The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class’ progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. <b>Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock.</i></p>
<p><b>PvE Extended List of Available Weapons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heavy</b>: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Tactical</b>: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Assault</b>: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol</li>
<li><b>Bulwark</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Sniper</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine</li>
<li><b>Vanguard</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game.</i></p>
<p><i>Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This isn’t the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement.</i></p>
<p><strong>New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol</strong></p>
<p><em>Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode</strong></p>
<p><i>This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go.</i></p>
<p><b>Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode</b></p>
<p><i>This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up.</i></p>
<p><b>Public Test Server (PTS)</b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward.</i></p>
<p><i>The PTS will be closed for now, but we’ll reopen it once we’ll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.</i></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>New Season Pass Content</b></h3>
<p><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Champion (Vanguard).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Weapon Skins (Bolt Carbine, Thunder Hammer, Chainsword).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Customisation (Helmet, Chest, Pauldron, Greave, Heraldry markings).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Imperial Fists Champion Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Imperial Fists Champion (Tactical).</li>
<li>Imperial Fists Signature Weapon Skin (Plasma Incinerator).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customisation</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Colours:</b> New default colours Volupus Pink and Thousand Sons Blue.</li>
<li><b>Bulwark Cloth Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the cloth for Bulwark tabard has been added as an option for the chest armour piece for customisation.</li>
<li><b>Hands Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the gauntlet armour piece is added. Now the primary colour is used to colour a fist and the secondary one colours a wrist and a shoulder part of the hand. <i>(This one is for you, Iron Hands and Crimson Fists fans!)</i></li>
<li>Lots of minor fixes for customisation of armour parts and emblems.​</li>
</ul>
<h2>​Gameplay &amp; Balancing tweaks</h2>
<h3>Progression Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Rebalance Rewards in the Eternal War Mode&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Match rewards are increased by 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Base EXP for PvE is increased</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Base XP for all difficulties in Operation Mode is increased by 10%.</p>
<h3>PvE Weapon Perks Update</h3>
<p><i>With this update we are rolling out a massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks. As a result all weapons received buffs one way or another.</i></p>
<p><i>Some notes regarding our future plans in terms of balancing: I want to say that I’m not a big fan of changing too many things at the same time. It is hard to predict the outcome, it’s a risk of introducing bugs and not every change is a simple number change. Past 2 patches changelogs were several pages long. I’m more in favor of gradual improvements of the game rather than chaotic changes back and forth. This means that we do see your feedback on some of the class perks and weapons etc, even looking at the current weapon perks rework I feel like we could have done a better job with plasma weapons and power sword perks.</i></p>
<p><i>There will be a second pass on class, weapon and prestige perks. Probably around Patch 8. I do think that those systems are in much much better shape than they were before patches and on release, the scope of the second pass will be smaller.</i></p>

<h3>Class Perks Update</h3>
<p><b>Tactical</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiating Impact</b>: Fixed incorrect bonus stack with Auspex Scan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sniper</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fixed incorrect stacking values of Sniper’s <b>Renewal</b> and <b>Squad Renewal</b> perks.&nbsp;</i><i>This resulted in following changes:</i></li>
<li><b>Squad Renewal</b>: Fixed incorrect ability charge restoring (15% instead of planned 10%).</li>
<li><b>Renewal</b>: Fixed typo in the description (5% ability charge restored instead of actual 15%).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Heavy</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced Force</b>: Fixed bonus to melee hold attacks that was mistakenly working in addition to bonus to all melee attacks.</li>
<li>General Balancing</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Assault (PvE only)</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jump Pack Ability</b>: recharge speed increased by 10%.</li>
<li><b>Contested Heals Restoring by Ground Pound was changed</b>: Ground Pound restores 30% of max contested health, regardless of the type of enemy and their number. When hitting with Ground Pound, 30% of max contested health is restored.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is a major buff to Assault survivability, because previously its contested health restore depended on too many factors. Now it is significantly increased and will be consistent.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a maximum cap to restore fade HP per action; and a max target to restore health per action to the following weapons:a</li>
<li>Multi-Melta</li>
<li>Melta Rifle</li>
<li>Heavy&nbsp;Plasma Incinerator</li>
<li>Plasma Incinerator</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This change may sound drastic on paper, but in reality the limit isn’t that strict. It only prevents situations where a single shot from Melta could restore the entire health bar when hitting only 3-4 enemies at the same time. Plus, the contested health restore will be more consistent now.</i></p>
<p>Firearms (PvE only)</p>
<p><i>We are continuing to polish up weapon balance and I think we are in a good spot right now where all weapons are viable on Absolute difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>Sure, some of them are still worse than others and we will continue to tweak them. Our next big objective is to take a closer look at weapon versions balance within the same archetype. Especially melee weapons.</i></p>
