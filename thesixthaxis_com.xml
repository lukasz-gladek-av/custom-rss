		<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/samson-is-a-new-action-game-by-former-just-cause-devs-new-studio/">Samson</a> was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435">Samson FAQ</a> has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles.</p>
<p>According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says,<em> “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave.&nbsp; For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.”&nbsp;</em>It goes on to say this about police chases. <em>“Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.”</em></p>

<p>The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>
</ul>

		<p>Project Cloud Games and Perp Games have confirmed that the action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/watch-over-eight-minutes-of-the-relic-first-guardian-gameplay/">The Relic: First Guardian gameplay</a> will be launching on May 26th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To announce this release date, a new trailer has been released which appears to show another boss that players will have to try and take on as they try to piece together The Relic: First Guardian’s story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Relic: First Guardian - 'A New Fate' Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCifOcNbp98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void, with the hope being that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void.</p>
<p>Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes and items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. Every single weapon, of which there are five types, and armour piece is unique with each one having its own story behind it, along with a specific vow that the previous owner made. These pieces can be found and used against the 70 bosses that make up the challenge of The Relic: First Guardian, with each again having its own unique backstory. Players will also have access to 12 skill trees allowing for a range of playstyles.</p>

		<p>A new update for RV There Yet? has been released by developer Nuggets Entertainment, adding the new location of Mt. Yurbuttsk. This new stop on the RV route allows players to get a spot of skiing in to relax during the winter months. That is all that has been added in this update with new animals, snowball fights, new tools, and new music. Nuggets Entertainment is also trialing localisation with this update for RV There Yet?, though most of this is concentrated in the Mabutts Valley.</p>

<p>RV There Yet? is a co-op game where players are travelling in their RV back from a vacation, but run into all sorts of issues on Route 65. Players need to find ways to survive this route and get their RV across challenge terrain, sometimes needing to winch it or jump it across gaps and up heights when there is road to follow. The RV does get damaged so finding scrap in the wild is also essential to keep it moving, lest you get trapped on Route 65 and never make it home.</p>
