		<p>Any conversation about the best indie developers must include Capybara Games. With a catalogue that stems from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/might-magic-clash-of-heroes">Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes</a>, through Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, to Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked, they consistently turn out the kind of games that stay with you long after you’ve finished playing. Battle Vision Network is set to be their latest, continuing in the vein of previous puzzle-infused games like Clash of Heroes, Critter Crunch, and Grindstone, and just like everything that’s gone before, it looks like it’s going to sink its way into your synapses and have you playing out moves while you’re trying to drift off to sleep.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battle Vision Network – Official Trailer | Capybara Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lr18stnLCrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is a tactical puzzle Roguelike battler, with teams competing in an intergalactic contest for glory. Dan Vader, Capy’s Creative Director tells us, “A Roguelike run of the game is framed as a season of this sport, and of this spectacle that is the BVN show.” He continues, “At the start of the game there’s only one team available, but as you progress you unlock more teams and more captains, each with their own playstyle and abilities.”</p>


<p>You can see that play out in the gameplay trailer, where a piece of toast shaped like a cowboy faces off against a skeleton in a rainbow cape – that’s Texas Toast vs. Rainbow Sparkle, obviously. It’s not just extremely bright and vibrant, but there’s the same sense of humour and quirky art direction that made Grindstone so memorable.</p>
<p>Dan tells us that Battle Vision Network is a spiritual successor to Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, and anyone who’s played that classic title will be able to see the same gameplay threads running through BVN, with two teams made up of different units facing off in turn-based combat.</p>


<p>Different units have unique abilities and uses, such as Todd Thumb. This little finger fella can be stacked into a row of three, which sends a large thumb-based attack straight at the opposition. As you progress through a run, you draft more and more units into your team, until you’ve got a full roster, with a host of different abilities that will give you a variety of tactical options to choose from.</p>
<p>As you complete rounds, you’ll earn Bucks, which you can spend on upgrades for your team, or to upgrade specific units. You’ll also gain a Penant Flag through each round, choosing between three enhancements for your team, and leaning into that Roguelike structure and the random factor that can turn a mediocre run into a mammoth success.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network began life as a mobile-first, PvP, season-based concept, and Capybara were originally working with Netflix to bring it to their mobile game library. However, in 2024, it became clear that Battle Vision Network wasn’t fitting into Netflix’s overarching plan, and Capy were thankfully able to reassess and rework the game, altering how players progress, shifting the focus to a single-player campaign, more like Grindstone and Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes.</p>

<p>Dan honed in on some of the key changes when coming from a mobile title, saying, “OK, we’re going to make a PC widescreen game, and we know that kind of audience soaks up complexity and depth, and experimentation and optimisation, and we can lean into that. And for us, we’re getting older, I have a family, I have a very demanding job, I don’t get to play as many 100-hour RPGs as I used to, so it’s emerged over the years that I really love run-based games, because they’re bite-sized. I can pick them up, I can play a little bit, have a little run, or pause a run, and I don’t feel that I haven’t made a dent in the game. So, we were really enthusiastic to explore our mechanics in that format that we were loving, anyway.”</p>
<p>One of the main differences over Clash of Heroes is that your Captain isn’t just an icon in the corner of the screen, they’re a physical unit with their own abilities, effects and place on the board. They can make the difference between failure and success, but you’ll need to know when and how to utilise them to maximise their impact.</p>

<p>Beyond the gameplay, fans of previous Capybara Games will be delighted to learn that the soundtrack is a collaboration between two of their previous composers: Jim Guthrie, who penned the soundtrack for Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP and Below, and Sam Webster, who wrote the soundtrack for Grindstone. BVN could well be amongst the best-sounding games of 2026, just on that legacy alone.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is set to launch initially on PC and the team are targeting being Steam Deck Verified, which seems like the perfect way to experience the puzzling action. As a huge fan of their previous games, BVN has dropped its way straight into my most-wanted list.</p>

		<p>With no build up or fanfare, Nintendo and Monolith Soft have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition…. edition, a paid upgrade to the game that brings technical improvements for the new generation hardware. Check out the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUGn2wulm_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrade is a fairly straightforward technical boost, now with a 60fps target through the game and 4K docked and 1080p handheld resolutions. We don’t know if Monolith has leant upon upscaling techniques or variable resolutions to get there, but this should make for a sharper looking, more responsive game in general.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can be bought all together on the Nintendo eShop or with a $5 / £4.19 upgrade for existing owners of the Switch release. A physical release will be available from April 16th.</p>
<p>One of the last Wii U cult classics to be ported to the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X arrived in March of last year. With it still fresh in Monolith’s memory, it’s understandable why they would return to this first, but fans of the series will understandably be pining for a similar Switch 2 Edition treatment to be given to Xenoblade Chronicles 2, 3 and the Definitive Edition of the Wii original. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 would probably receive the greatest benefits, as Monolith’s first effort with the Switch did have its struggles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">our review of the Switch 1 release</a>, Dom said, “With a smattering of improvements as it jumps to Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers up an epic sci-fi tale set in one of the very best open worlds.”</p>
