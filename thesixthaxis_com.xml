		<p>The new leader of the Space Pirates, Sylux puts the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> into motion and is the main antagonist that Samus has to face off against in this game.</p>
<p>And you will have to face off against him multiple times, each time with Sylux bringing new and more powerful moves to try and defeat you. But you wouldn’t expect Samus to lose these fights, would you? Still, she could probably use a few hints to make her life easier, right?</p>
<p>Obviously <strong>there are some progression spoilers</strong> within this guide, so at this point, <strong>stop reading if you aren’t currently struggling to battle Sylux!</strong></p>


<p>Right… all good? Let’s get on with it.</p>

<p>In this guide, we’re going to talk about the first encounter with Sylux.</p>

<p>Battling Sylux in Volt Forge, scans give very few clues as to what gear he is using and how best to defeat him.</p>
<p>From a damage perspective, you mainly want to just constantly hit him with Beam Cannon attacks and Missiles. Lock on to target him, and keep firing while strafing and dodging his attacks.</p>
<h2>Sylux attack moves and how to avoid them</h2>
<p>Sylux will dish out the following attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Run and gun</strong> –&nbsp;Sylux runs laterally around the arena while shooting at you. If you’re strafing and moving, this is easy to evade.<br>
<strong>Charge attack</strong> –&nbsp;Winding up for a melee attack, Sylux mmoves his right arm across his body before leaping forward to deal a short range swipe. While locked on, double-tap B to dodge out of the way at the right time.<br>
<strong>Energy wave</strong> – Sylux slams the floor and sends an energy wave from his position. Watch for his move and jump over the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Homing darts</strong> – Standing still, Sylux creates two sets of three homing darts. If time it right, a charged Power Beam attack can trigger and explode these darts before they fully launch, converting them to health and ammo for you. The darts are otherwise fairly easy to dodge with good timing.<br>
<strong>Green tornado</strong> –&nbsp;This is the trickiest move. Sylux starts moving around like a spinning top, creating a green field that deflects your attacks until you can break him out of this mode. You need to deal damage to his feet, and the most reliable method I found was to switch to the Morph Ball and place Psychic Bombs while leading him. Getting this timing right is difficult and Sylux can immediately launch back into this attack a couple of times. After hitting him enough times, he will be staggered for a damage phase.</p>

<p>Below 2/3rds health, Sylux will add two more moves to his repertoire:</p>
<p><strong>Flying shot</strong> –&nbsp;He hovers and flies around, shooting from above. Similar to Run and Gun.<br>
<strong>Energy Rain</strong> – Sylux hovers and sends out rings of green energy balls that drop down in a growing radius. Find the gaps between energy balls to evade.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Green Tornado</strong> – As before, but his rate of movement is faster and direction changes can be more erratic. Still use the same tactic.</p>
<p>Below 1/3rd health, there’s another new attack:</p>
<p><strong>Energy Beam Swipe</strong> –&nbsp;From the middle of the arena, Sylux sends out a solid beam of energy and swipes it across the room. Jump over or ball to avoid.</p>

<p>Defeating Sylux this first time isn’t so bad, and you’re rewarded with an Energy Tank to boost your health going forwards. There’s also a rather odd little surprise. What could <em>that</em> possibly mean?</p>

		<p>One of the highlights of my writing this year was heading out to meet the team from 10Chambers at the European Unity headquarters, and getting to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with Den of Wolves</a>. This futuristic heist game has a hell of a legacy – 10Chambers’ studio founder Ulf Anderson was the creator of Payday and GTFO – and even in our short time with the game, it was clear that the mix of planning, gunplay and crazy Inception-like sections was looking to be something special. While they’re continuing to work hard on the forthcoming game, 10Chambers are continuing a drip-feed of information, this time showcasing a new trailer, where they let four of the key community members for the game go hands-on. It looks like they had a pretty good time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Community Hands-On Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCUnDA8BpIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Robin Björkell, the Communications Director at 10 Chamber said, “I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer – but no. They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game – not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist – ask them,”</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear from one of them straight away, with RandomKenny, one of the invited players, saying, “Absolutely incredible experience being invited to play Den of Wolves early. Planning and executing how you’re going to tackle heists is super satisfying. I had such a blast playing, and I honestly can’t wait for the game to be released”.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the players can be seen tackling a heist in a previously unseen level inside a robot factory. Inside this gigantic factory, the players face resistance from both human and robotic enemies, all while deploying spider drills to hack vaults full of valuables.</p>

<p>Obviously, the big question remains, just when will Den of Wolves release? The team are remaining tight-lipped despite the huge groundswell of community interest, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to get a set date any time soon.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-458384">{“Source” : “NVIDIA APP”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}</p>
<p>“Even though we’ve not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We’re so grateful for our community’s support, and we can’t wait to show more details about the game. The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don’t think it’s fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out,” says Oscar J-T Holm, co-founder of 10 Chambers.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t get a release date for Den of Wolves set in stone quite yet, here’s hoping that we learn more in early 2026, at least in terms of beta testing or a potential demo.</p>
