		<p>Reigns of Ruin: Runegate answers the question “What if it was Stargate, but it’s dwarves, and fighting against goblins instead of humans with worms living in their tummies?” This game tasks you with stepping through the titular portal in an effort to re-establish a sanctuary for dwarven civilisation.</p>

<p>What that looks like is a side-scrolling hack and slash RPG where you travel to micro levels, battle baddies and gradually build up your home base to further your adventuring options.</p>


<p>It starts, though, with fleeing from the goblins that threaten the last vestiges of the stronghold that you canonically built in the original Regions of Ruin. At the last possible moment, you run through the portal opened in the Runegate and arrive at what will be your new home, an abandoned, crumbling underground city that will be your task to restore and repopulate.</p>
<p>And so it’s time to step through the Runegate time and again, venturing to other planes to gather resources, convince other dwarves to join your cause, and battling the forces of evil that you might encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Though certainly still in keeping with the original game, there’s a good step forward for the visual style of Runegate. It’s still got a low-resolution pixel art style, there’s still this flattened parallax tone, but there’s also just a lot more finesse to the character designs, the scenery you’re running through, everything. It’s much more in keeping with better examples of this art style, such as its Raw Fury stablemate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/07/kingdom-two-crowns-review/">Kingdom Two Crowns</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring each realm has a pleasing feel to it, as you’re presented with a world map that you need to fill in. From the revealed land around the Runegate, you can reveal another path of land and reveal points of interest to visit, so long as you have enough food supplies to meet the one-time cost that it takes to get there. You could immediately travel to the farthest flung reaches of the map, if you had enough food, but really the game’s intention is that you’ll start local and branch out from there, following narrative and mission threads as you go.</p>
<p>Happening on a dwarven settlement in a dank-looking cave and talking to its people, they initially seem reticent to come and join your small group on the other side of the Runegate. But if you prove yourself by, for example, clearing out a bunch of goblins, battling packs of wild wolves, reuniting lost brothers, then they’ll consider it more seriously. That then means heading back to the world map, maybe paying the fee to explore a nearby patch of darkness and reveal new locations to venture to. You’ll rarely know exactly what to expect, but odds are there will be someone or something to fight.</p>
<p>This is where we come to the meat and potatoes of an action RPG. As a side-scrolling game, there’s only so many ways that combat can really unfold. You can attack with your equipped weapon (whether it’s one or two handed), block if you have a shield, wind up to fire a crossbow or throw a javelin, and dodge. You can boost your abilities by levelling up stats in Combat, Defence, Ranged and Rogueish attributes, and you might gravitate toward a particular style and type of weapon – I quite liked the standard axe and shield, after sending an opening crossbow bolt at any enemies.</p>

<p>Avoiding damage is rather tricky when attacks from onrushing melee assailants and more distant archers come quick and fast, but the pace of combat means you can clobber your way through. It also helps that you can have allies alongside to take some of the aggression.</p>
<p>Once any battle is done and dusted, then comes the time to smash everything in sight to pieces and gather up the resources they provide. You’ll need things like wood or stone for when you travel back through the Runegate to your home base and get to fixing up the joint. There’s crumbled bridges to repair, there’s marketplaces to rebuild, people to talk to for more missions, and more.</p>

<p>There’s a potentially rather moreish gameplay loop to discover here, the snackable combat going hand-in-hand with exploration and base building. What’s especially nice is how little stories and ideas can unfold, like finding a captive and releasing them before you’ve been asked to, just because you stumbled across the goblins first, or thinking it a good idea to release a caged wolf… who seems to blame you for their captivity. Thankfully not all wolves are immediately hostile. In fact, we stumbled across one rather eerie area with just a large pack of wolves seemingly standing guard, and one of them with whom we could engage, giving food until they let us pet them and actually recruit them as a battle companion.</p>
<p>Also, when you drink a stein of beer, you raise your other weapon-holding hand while necking it, and then smash the glass on the floor. Classic dwarves.</p>

			<p>Chains of Freedom is a turn-based strategy game, similar to XCOM, but set in a post-apocalyptic Eastern European country instead of an alien invasion. As with every other apocalypse, the land is messed up, full of unhinged lunatics, and there’s mutants about. It’s a good thing that you’ve got a squad of tactically minded folks to fight through these enemies with.</p>
<p><iframe title="CHAINS OF FREEDOM | Official Launch trailer | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuXpfuYO4tM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Chains of Freedom isn’t going to blow your mind and the characters aren’t exactly novel, but it’s enough to keep you going to the next combat at least. A mysterious disease called EDEN is spreading through the land and those it doesn’t just kill become deformed, crystalline monsters who, naturally, make up a good chunk of the enemies you’ll be facing. Again, it’s not particularly unique, but I found some moments to be enjoyable enough even if I ended up treating the story as a thread to connect the combat encounters.</p>


<p>The biggest issue with the story is that it will take characters from your party without warning, suddenly replacing them with other characters who have different abilities. These new characters are perfectly functional, of course, but you’ve just spent hours with the others and equipped them with essential tools. When they’re taken away it means the time you spent preparing them was wasted, and if anyone can be gone at any given moment, it becomes very easy to not care at all about any of them. I only truly cared about a character when they had unique abilities, but even then sometimes they’re taken away from you, leaving you without that ability. Whilst this does force you to switch up your tactics, not being able to rely on having your carefully assembled squad of characters is a pain.</p>


<p>Thankfully the actual combat is pretty great. If you’ve played XCOM, you know what to expect here. Each character has action points that are spent on moving, attacking, and using abilities or consumables. A few abilities can make certain characters feel really quite powerful, such as a grappling hook which I was using to reposition a sniper, but could also be used to quickly get into or out of combat for a little melee punishment, or to flank around hunkered down enemies. Another character could sacrifice a third of her health to gain 20AP, which has saved her life many times, not to mention ended quite a few enemies’ lives. Since there are no limitations on how many times you can attack per turn, she could attack four times with that ability, making her very powerful.</p>
<p>The other side of this is that the game does feel a little bit easy, with the only real challenges being bosses, and even they’re not that tough. There are a few enemies that I would consider annoying, but not really challenging, such as one that teleports away when damaged, leaving behind a lesser enemy, which wasn’t really difficult to handle, but made the combat longer and more laborious. Some combat encounters will also bring in a few waves of reinforcements, often just appearing right next to your characters upon arrival, which is rather annoying in a game about tactics. Despite these issues, the combat can be very satisfying and was the real reason I wanted to keep playing.</p>

<p>Characters are customisable, though mostly by equipping weapons, tool, and consumables that you find whilst exploring the environment and looting defeated enemies. Favouring sniper characters to keep enemies at a distance, I found a crossbow that causes bleed and burning on enemies that I was partial to, but there’s plenty of variety through shotguns, flamethrowers, as well as various types of grenades, like cryogenic grenades. They provide a lot of effective options, so long as you don’t mind combing every area for loot. The walk speed is needlessly slow and there’s little of interest in the environments other than the loot, so exploration can feel a bit dull. Crafting materials will allow you to craft many of the aforementioned things, as well as ammunition for all your guns, which I had to do a lot as I was constantly running out.</p>
<p>The most interesting things you find through exploring are biocrystals. These are a weaponized form of the EDEN virus that will give a character a bonus. Some are incredibly useful, whilst others are basically useless, but at least there’s a lot of options if you find them. Characters can be upgraded to be able to equip more biocrystals,&nbsp;but only at certain shrines that can only grant a limited amount of biocrystal slots. This is how your character progresses and since it seems like you can miss some of these shrines &nbsp;– there’s been a few moments where I realised I hadn’t seen one for a while and got suspicious – it also seems to be possible to just miss some character progression. Also, as mentioned, you can give these upgrades to characters only for them to suddenly be removed from your party and replaced with someone else, wasting all your time and investment.</p>

<p>The graphics in Chains of Freedom are good, but not that impressive. It does the job well enough. Being post-apocalyptic, the environments are all drab, broken down buildings and such like that aren’t particularly interesting to look at in addition to the game not being pretty on a technical level, so the only draw for exploration is the loot you can find. The game sounds good enough as well, with some punchy gun sounds, though the voice acting oscillates between “serviceable” and “a bit off”.</p>
