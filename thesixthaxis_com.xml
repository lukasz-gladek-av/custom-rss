		<p>Five years on from the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, IO Interactive has announced yet another impactful update and feature for their World of Assassination trilogy. Along with an overhauled IOI Account system, cross-progression will be added to Hitman WOA, letting you take your progress with your between platforms and storefronts.</p>
<p>Going live on 3rd February, enabling cross-progression will ask you to link platforms to your IOI Account and then choose one platform profile to become your primary account. All other linked platforms will then defer to this primary account, instead of having progress and achievements merged. It’s a shame, but it is understandable given the potential for problems that this would introduce.</p>


<p>The following progression data is shared across platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li data-list-item-id="ee883927197eb6b916f2a2ae0d01c6e6b"><strong>Experience</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e9a47b05ccaa834fe2831a9defbc15d13"><strong>Player Level</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e0c64bac2284521f595e3c0851665fc63"><strong>Challenges</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="eea2562a514f6a86df7d818fc8c4965f2"><strong>Location&nbsp;Mastery</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e8c75d381f57c0f39239f67a720626804"><strong>Unlocks&nbsp;and Inventory</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="e99a35d8f441abc9ae2fdedbe00ca4e49"><strong>Achievements&nbsp;/&nbsp;Trophies</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="eeb408de67adb90ae6437e6603416ad47"><strong>Freelancer Mode Progression</strong></li>
<li data-list-item-id="ed0661519f1cc30d5c6f6892ac1f81ed2"><strong>Campaign&nbsp;Story Progress</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that are not shared between platforms are any kind of purchases – game license, DLC license, and DLC-based unlocks – leaderboard scores and level saves (either offline or online). This means that, if you want to play some DLC levels on a system where you haven’t bought it, then you can’t.</p>
<p>The other major caveat is that the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 progression carryover will now come to an end on 3rd February. This was created to enable the importing of Hitman 2 game progression into its sequel, but with this now being half a decade old compared to WOA, and again wanting to keep data integrity and prevent issues and conflicts, IO is bringing it to an end. You still have two weeks <a href="https://profile.hitman.com/">to do so here</a>.</p>

<p>For more details on everything this means for the game, head to <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">IO Interactive’s FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>In general, this is pretty great news. Again, it’s a shame that you can’t merge progression somehow, as my personal playtime has be spread across multiple systems, but the bulk of my time has been on PlayStation, so I can forego the loss.</p>
<p>Hitman 3 first launched back in early 2021, a concluding chapter to the ambitious trilogy that IO Interactive had started five years previous. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 review</a>, Jim said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>

		<p>Square Enix and Deck Nine have revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-reunion">Life Is Strange: Reunion</a>, with Chloe Price returning to reunite with Max Caulfield and put a bow on their story together. The game is launching on 26th March 2026 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Yes, Chloe is back, even if, well, you know what you did at the end of the first game.</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning</strong> for the original Life Is Strange and Double Exposure in the reveal stream and loosely for this announcement post.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange Returns in 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2eHeCKYHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will take us back to Caldeon University, where Max is now a photography teacher, following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. However, as she returns from a weekend away, she discovers the university ablaze and all her friends trapped in the fire. Her only course of action is to jump back in time three days, travelling through a photograph once more to try and figure out what happened and how to stop it.</p>

<p>And then Chloe shows up. Now, for an awful lot of people Chloe died back in 2015 at the end of the original game, with players having to choose between saving Chloe and with saving Arcadia Bay from a huge storm. Life Is Strange: Reunion will honour your decision within the dialogue and narrative flow, and not pick a single canonical path for you.</p>
<p>How does it do this? Well, Double Exposure’s evolution of Max’s powers and the events that transpired have done some kind of timey-wimey stuff and somehow managed to merge both potential timelines. Chloe arrives as she is now haunted by memories of both timelines, while Max remains traumatised by what happened, even through it’s undone. It’s a neat path, and this game will aim to give them some kind of closure, it seems, wrapping up their combined and separated stories.</p>

<p>Together, and with Max’s group of friends, they need to get to the bottom of what’s happening at Caledon. They’ll uncover plots for revenge, secret societies, and potentially worse, and you’ll get to play as both Max and Chloe in this game. Max has her classic time rewinding ability with the spiral in the corner of the screen, choosing alternative paths through a situation, winding things back and picking different routes, and using the ability to retain inventory and position while time skipping to solve environmental puzzles. Chloe, meanwhile, has her Backtalk ability to snarkily wriggle her way through various scenarios that she runs into.</p>

<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will be available in a standard edition, priced at €49.99/£44.99, but there are also a Deluxe Edition, Twin Pack, and Collector’s Edition versions of the game with various extras. Pre-ordering the game or buying through the first month of release will net you the Max and Chloe Classic Outfits DLC.</p>
<p>The Life is Strange series has been in the hands of Deck Nine for a good few years now, with the IP held by Square Enix and original developer Dontnod branching off to other projects since Life is Strange 2. Having bounced between new protagonists and settings, Deck Nine brought us back to Max Caulfield’s story with 2024’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/">our review</a>, Reu said, “Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a very easy game to recommend. If you have enjoyed previous games in the series, this is doing enough of the same to scratch that same lowkey mystery vibes itch. The ability to shift between timelines can become a touch overwhelming at times, but there’s several things in place across the UI, accessibility options, and narrative flow to keep the gameplay smooth. What’s more, I think this game might have redeemed Max Caulfield for me too, so take that how you will.”</p>
