<p>This Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles trailer includes the new user interface that players will see in the enhanced edition, where it will be easier to see turn order and issue commands. There is a birds eye tactical view added so you can better plan your strategy in battles. A battle speed option is also present in the enhanced version so you can speed through battles instead of waiting for every animation to play out at normal speed. The trailer also shows the enhanced visuals over the original so the art looks on modern displays. The game will feature new voice acting and new conversations that have been written by Yasumi Matsuno.</p>
