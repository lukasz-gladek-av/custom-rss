		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/2k-games">2K Games</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hangar-13">Hangar 13</a> are rolling out their major “Free Ride” update for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Available across all platforms, this free addition to the crime sim prequel is chock full of new features, including a new, more open-ended way to experience one of 2025’s most overlooked video games.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Free Ride Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHnpuVKyCAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The titular “Free Ride” mode, will allow players to immerse themselves in the criminal underworld of Sicily’s Valle Dorata as they complete a series of combat, stealth, and racing challenges away from the linear narrative campaign of Mafia: The Old Country. Completing these challenges will earn you Dinari which can then be used to purchase new outfits, weapons, vehicles, and charms that can be used in both Free Ride and the main campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>But that’s not all, other key features from today’s update include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>First-person driving</b><span> for petrolheads who admire the game’s garage of vintage vehicles and dry-by vistas.</span></li>
<li><span>A dedicated </span><b>photo mode </b><span>feature for snapping cinematic in-game moments, character portraits, and gorgeous period environments.</span></li>
<li><b>Classic difficulty </b><span>for made men seeking the ultimate challenge.</span></li>
<li><span>The all-new </span><b>Cinema Siciliano</b><span> mode that transforms Mafia’s visuals into a classic black and white movie, complete with an authentic-sounding audio filter.</span></li>
</ul>


<p><span>Overall, the Free Ride update for Mafia: The Old Country introduces a clever remix of gameplay elements that will certainly help add some longevity to what is the shortest Mafia game in the franchise. And while it doesn’t transform the prequel into a full open-world experience, the new Free Ride game mode will meet some of those Mafia purists half way.</span></p>
<p><span>According to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/take-two-interactive">Take Two Interactive</a>, Mafia: The Old Country has exceeded the company’s expectations and, despite being snubbed by The Game Awards, it has received a generally positive reception from fans and critics. Hopefully, the game’s success will signal the viability of smaller, lower budget AAA games within the market that don’t all have to chase the same open-world or live service formulas.</span></p>
