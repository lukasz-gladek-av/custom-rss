		<p dir="ltr">The Outlast Trials has a new game mode, with the addition of Invasion in today’s update. This permanent new game mode brings PvP to the multiplayer horror game for the first time, arriving alongside the return of the time-limited Program Geister catalogue of outfits for Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials | Geister Limited-Time Event &amp; Invasion Update Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCCMkEwIsGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Invasion Mode allows players to either play as Reagents or invade games as an Imposter. Only a limited set of Imposters can invade a particular trial, appearing as a knife wielding maniac, but those waiting be the eyes and ears for their teammate until it’s their turn. While observing, they can ping targets and help strategise, keeping the active Imposters informed. Those Imposters will appear armed with a knife, in either a Slash or Stab variety, with the former dealing damage and the latter needing to charge up for an instant kill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An Imposter only has a limited time to take down a target, being forced to head back to the nearest Insertion Gate or be electrocuted for being naughty, naughty players. They can also punished with death, which leads to a time penalty for their next spawn. They do have some key advantages, being able to see the noise made by Reagents, as well as being immune to psychosis gas and Prime Asset effects, though they won’t be able to pick up items.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of a match, Imposters will be evaluated for inflicting damage, slaying Reagents, and managing to survive their turn.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s all a rather interesting twist on the typical asymmetrical horror multiplayer game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, there’s two new MK Challenges:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Beguile the Children</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The television screen is the retina of the mind’s eye, where anything is true and everything is possible, especially when the audience cannot see the tools that are shaping their mind. Take control of the broadcast, reshape the subliminal message, and we will let you out.</em></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Investigate the Minotaur</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Corporate power and dynastic wealth are the cornerstone of free societies, but only so long as extracurricular activities can be kept quiet. Once private hobbies become public scandals, the guilty must be exposed and destroyed so more tedious dynasties can be put in place. Find the evidence of the Buffalo Minotaur’s crimes, bring it to the press, and we will let you out.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">And the Geister limited time event is on for Halloween, earning you tokens for completing Trials and Geister Tasks, will suffering through Geister Variators. The event runs from today through to 18th November, with even tokens earned unlocking exclusive cosmetics. Spend ’em while you have ’em!</p>
