		<p>Clawing its way to the number one spot as our most wanted video game of 2026, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> has carved up the competition as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man">Spider-Man</a> developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, prepares to show us more of this hugely anticipated PlayStation exclusive.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s release schedule having looked a little light in terms of first party blockbusters, the company is no doubt hoping that lighting will strike twice following the mammoth commercial success of its web-slinging Spider-Man series. However, instead of taking that tried and tested open world formula fuelling these games and applying it to a different superhero, Insomniac is going for a change in not only genre, but tone as well.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It makes sense, really: to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed would be absurd, but that’s not to say Wolverine won’t be as visually rich or character-driven as the recent trio of Spider-Man adventures.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>We’ve yet to see a full combat demo though it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for. We’re expecting acrobatic lunges, spinning claws, and some rather gnarly takedowns as teased in Sony’s most recent trailer.</p>

<p>Part of what made Marvel’s Spider-Man such a big hit was its refusal to cart out yet another adaptation of his origin story. While Wolverine’s own past has been explored numerous times in movies (without mentioning the myriad comic book arcs over the years) there’s plenty there for gamers to sink their claws into without it being overly familiar. From what we’ve seen and heard, it appears as though Marvel’s Wolverine will visit various flashpoints in the character’s life, including his escape from Weapon X, his pursuit of a quiet life in Canada, and a trip to Madripoor.</p>
<p>We also know who will play Wolverine in this upcoming video game adaptation with Liam McIntyre lending his gravelly voice to the X-Men legend. Speaking of X-Men, what we’re perhaps most excited for is seeing how other famous faces make their way into the game with Mystique and Omega Red due to make an appearance. If Sony is going all-in on creating a Marvel gaming universe, it will also be interesting to see how this game links back to Spider-Man.</p>
<p>There’s no launch date for Marvel’s Wolverine just yet though we’re expecting it to land sometime in the second half of 2026, perhaps even looking to capitalise on the snowballing excitement surrounding Avenger’s Doomsday and its December theatrical release.</p>
