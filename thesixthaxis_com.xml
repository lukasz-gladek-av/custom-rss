		<p>It’s honestly so refreshing for a game that’s steeped in Japanese folklore to emerge without mention of being a Soulslike or Roguelite. Of course, it’s equally pleasing that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is reviving a beloved PlayStation 2 franchise, which flared through the early 2000s before drifting into obscurity for more than two generations of console.</p>
<p><iframe title="OnimushaGCPreview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Edo-era Kyoto and its countless shrines and temples are corrupted by Malice and the emerging Genma monstrosities, the only person that can stand in their way is the renowned historical swordsman Miyamoto Musashi (modelled after actor Toshiro Mifune and voiced by Kenichiro Thomson), a samurai who’s found himself bonded to an Oni Gauntlet that gives him the chance to fight back against the supernatural.</p>


<p>This is a fresh take on the Onimusha series, meaning that you won’t have to have played the earlier titles to appreciate the story –&nbsp;more than understandable given the almost two decades since the last new entry in the series –&nbsp;and absolutely plays into Musashi’s character and bond with the spirit within his gauntlet.</p>
<p>But first, one of the most important things for Onimusha: Way of the Sword is to let you feel like a badass samurai, souped up by some supernatural powers. At its heart, you’re looking to both damage enemies and sap their resistance, staggering them to let you deal a finishing blow (if you haven’t already offed them, of course). While you can absolutely take a front-foot approach to combat, the Issen technique returns, allowing you counter enemy attacks and dish out devastating killing blows in return, slicing them in half in the process. It takes a moment to get used to, in contrast to many contemporary control schemes, as you hold to block and tap another button to counter. This even works on ranged attacks, letting you ping arrows back at archers, staggering them and giving you the chance to get close for a finishing move –&nbsp;you can even string together a bunch of finishers in an Issen Chain.</p>


<p>Much of this is also dependent on you’re ability to evade, with another swift finishing move only available to you once you’ve filled up the meter by dodging. This requires you to ghost out of the way of the incoming strike, leaving a fleeting spectral form as Musashi shifts barely half a step to evade, keeping you right in the thick of the action when compared to a full-blown dodge roll. Each dodge gradually builds up the meter until you can unleash this attack.</p>
<p>Defeating enemies sees their souls float nearby waiting for you to manually absorb them in three different colours and types. Blue charges your energy attack, yellow your health and red your experience. You’ll need to be fast in certain situations, some kinds of floating Genma will actively try to suck up these souls and use them to attack you with elemental abilities. Obviously, it’s best not to let them do that…</p>

<p>There’s also a new type of soul, a black soul to absorb that furthers the story and reveals more of the plight that befell this region. Drawing upon a real myth surrounding the Kiymizu-dera temple, this shadowy flashback reveals the local population making sacrifices to try to and appease the demons, though naturally failing as kids and others are sent plummeting down the sides of the mountain.</p>
<p>There’s environmental puzzles tied in with some of these moments, giving you Genma tendrils to follow and destroy, though we only really saw this in its most basic form. More fleshed out were some of the environmental interactions that fed into the combat. You can, for example, kick up a tatami mat to use it to block some attacks, or grab and push a cart through a bundle of enemies to gain the advantage.</p>

<p>Our hands on time with the game concluded with a battle against another swordsman with an Oni Gauntlet. Sasaki Ganryu has what would no doubt be an utterly infuriating personality to encounter in real life, all of his movements looking so thoroughly lazy, but backed by bags of self-confidence and awareness that, yeah, he really is all that. He’s in many ways the polar opposite to Musashi’s steadfast tone.</p>
<p>He’s a satisfying opponent to face, able to strike quickly but, at this point in the game, still rather languid and lackadaisical, giving you plenty of opportunities to dodge and strike back. Once his stamina is depleted, it triggers a full-blown Issen Break, giving you a choice of where to strike –&nbsp;head or armour –&nbsp;perhaps giving a more tactical approach to later combat.</p>
<p>After two decades away, it’s lovely to see Onimusha return and do so with such a striking panache. this is absolutley one to keep an eye on for 2026.</p>

		<p>Everstone Studio has confirmed that its Wuxia open world action adventure RPG Where Winds Meet will launch on November 14th for PS5 and PC, with the game now available to wishlist on the platforms. Where Winds Meet is set in Ancient China during the 10th century known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. You can get a feel for the world in the release date trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Where Winds Meet - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PB0i3293jRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story for Where Winds Meet puts you in the shoes of a marital artist who travels the land looking for answers after their home has been lost. That will be the main story but Everstone has stated that there will be plenty of smaller side quests that will flesh out the world and provide more context to the main story. Where Winds Meet is looking like an ambitious game, with it being stated that there are approximately 10,000 unique NPCs with their own personalities and reactions to the player’s actions. As the player, you will be granted quite a bit of freedom in how to interact with the world around you, from causing trouble and havoc for the law and local populace to forging alliances and being a paragon of good. The ambition does not just stop there, with there being 20 regions to explore and 40 different martial mystic arts to learn including Tai Chi, Toad Style, and Lion’s Roar. These arts can be used in combat and to solve puzzles. Everstone claims that with the combos of mystic arts and various weapons players will be able to create their own unique combat styles.</p>

		<p>Hanging upside down for any length of time is a pretty bad time, and as our hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> begins and we see Grace Ashcroft struggling to free herself from a tilted gurney and remove the cannula from her arm, it’s pretty clear that she wasn’t having much fun there. What awaits in our first hands on demo is another exemplary slice of modern Resident Evil horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>FBI agent Grace Ashcroft has found herself in dire straights after being sent to investigate a series of strange deaths at a hotel where her mother died almost a decade before. Just like Ethan in Resi 7, she’s a very different protagonist to series staples like Leon Kennedy or Chris Redfield, both having grown into being ultra-competent fighters of big bad monsters. Grace feels completely out of her depth, simply doing anything that she can to survive, using basic FBI desk jockey training and nous.</p>


<p>So what does face her? Well, a creepy, poorly lit hotel, it seems. Venturing out after quickly interacting with everything possible – the medical machine, the pool of blood Grace has left behind, the written note – and what immediately starts to stand out is this interplay between light and dark. While this first room is brightly lit, you can flick on and off the room light and a small table light, completely changing the tone of the room as you do so.</p>


<p>The hallway outside, meanwhile, is bathed in an eerie red glow and, making our way to what looks like a kitchen area and finding the light switch reveals just a portion of the space with a harsh flickering light. Exploring further down the hallway, there’s further pools of light and dark, adding greatly to the sense of foreboding.</p>
<p>What’s nice and fun through this are the little nods and winks to Resident Evil and the genre in general. A locked door needs a key, a locked gate has a missing fuse, and there’s things like empty typewriter tape cases and green herbs to find while interacting with everything possible. The main things we find of actual use are a couple empty bottles and a lighter that gives us independence from what the switches and working lights dictate.</p>
<p>This leads us to the big scary moment, the lighter letting us reach a door that was previously practically impossible to reach in the pitched darkness – Grace isn’t a Vin Diesel type with night vision –&nbsp;triggering the reveal of the huge monster that will stalk her through the game.</p>

<p>This is such a classic staple of the Resident Evil series, but it’s still such a thrill to have the monster revealed and endlessly hunt us down. After Lady Dimitrescu got everyone so freakin’ thirsty for taller ladies in Village, I’m not sure that Resident Evil Requiem will have quite the same effect, but I love just how large the monster is, barely able to fit through the doorways and rooms, and giving me a bit of a Little Nightmares feel for the dramatic size disparity.</p>
<p>All that Grace can do is hide, wait, try to be quiet while searching for a screwdriver –&nbsp;this needed us to move a trolley around to stand on, which could knock things off and make noise, but I was delighted to lure the monster to this room and have her smash the trolley around in a surprisingly helpful way – and then try to avoid the monster as she stomps after you. It’s clear that, especially through a close encounter, Grace is absolutely terrified by this, but this only truly becomes apparent when playing in third person as opposed to first person.</p>

<p>We’ve seen Capcom retrofit third person views into Resident Evil Village, but Requiem will have the option available to you from day one, and it’s clear that Capcom has put a lot of effort in to make them both feel as good as possible. There’s definitely a different tone to evading the monster when in first person, having the narrowed view of the world and tentatively holding a lighter in front of you for illumination, hiding under tables more cautiously approaching corners, and generally being wrapped up in the more claustrophobic nature of the view. Third person brings us more of an action horror tone, lightly diluting some of the terror, perhaps, but there’s so much nuance to the character animation this time around.</p>
<p>Should the monster burst through a wall or after a tense and fraught cutscene, Grace’s movements are much more frantic, she staggers and stumbles while hurrying away, adding a bit more depth to her characterisation that isn’t quite so feasible when playing in first person. I honestly can’t quite decide whether I’d prefer to play in first or third person at this point, but Requiem has a great shot at really catering to lovers of both styles or past Resi games.</p>
<p>Either way, though, there is that use of light and dark. The monster, it turns out, doesn’t really appreciate bright spaces, and you can use that to your advantage. If you’re unable to get past her through the corridors, you can draw her back to the starting room, switch the light off to bring her inside, and then skirt around the furniture to evade and escape her. It’s just one of a number of options, though. I saw others able to just tuck themselves deep into a dark corner and evade, but I guess I was a touch impatient!</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem promises another new beginning for the iconic horror franchise, but it’s still one that’s deeply tied to the series’ past. There’s plenty of tropes here, plenty of references back to the original games, and gameplay ideas that will be familiar, but from my brief hands on with the game, there’s still so, so much to be excited about.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and we can’t wait to see more.</p>
