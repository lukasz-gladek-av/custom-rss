		<p>Glum is not your usual game protagonist. He has no chiselled jaw, no artfully coiffure ‘do and absolutely zero charisma. In fact, he’s a completely unlikeable stinky little goblin, which paradoxically makes him charming in his own way. What he does have, though, is the kind of feet that not even the darkest parts of the internet would pay to take a look at. It is fortunate that quite early in the game you’ll find a boot to cover up the offending appendages, as you’ll be spending a lot of time staring at that foot.</p>
<p><iframe title="GLUM | Official Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRQDbVo5oJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Glum begins with the titular ‘hero’ locked up in a barracks. Your first task is to find a way to escape and this takes the form of a well designed tutorial. You learn how to kick objects, obviously, but also how to use kicks to jump higher and even chain jumps together. As you progress you’ll also find a magical boot that you can fire off to reach distant objects and enemies. You’re not entirely restricted to kicking, however, as you can pick up some objects and carry them so that you can, well, kick them at things. Look, kicking is what this game is about, OK?</p>


<p>The world of Glum is bright and colourful and feels like it’s been taken straight out of a Shrek film. You’ll face hordes of armoured knights and archers, all just needing a swift kick in the face to conquer. Combat is made more interesting by the vast numbers of hazards scattered around the environment, from fires to iron maidens. Kicking foes into these reminds me a lot of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review/">Bulletstorm</a>, with obvious nods to the grandfather of kicking games, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.</p>


<p>As an Early Access title, Glum currently offers one major level to explore, as well as the tutorial area. This might not sound like much, but the map is fairly large and has a decent amount of hidden areas and secrets. As well as the core objective (in this case ringing bells to disturb the local commander) there are gnomes to smash and – <em>ahem – </em>&nbsp;mature magazines to track down. These unlock extra boots and abilities respectively and this looks to be one of the biggest areas of potential in the game with skills that can change the way you play hopefully added as development progresses. Finding these hidden items adds a welcome amount of depth and replayability.</p>
<p>Gnomes can be tracked down by listening out for their sinister little chuckles whilst the jazz mags are either hidden away behind intricate platforming sections or rewards for sidequests. These sidequests are appropriately bizarre, too, with highlights being kicking rats into a sentient campfire or feeding a chicken to a mysterious creature in a well. I don’t think Glum will be getting any PETA recommendations to be honest.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished the main questline of the level you get to face a wonderfully ludicrous boss battle that would be a shame to spoil. This encounter requires that you use all of your abilities to triumph and is a good demonstration of what the full game will hopefully offer. Once you’ve cleared the narrative part of the game there is an arena mode to enjoy, but an update killed my save so this wasn’t unlocked for me to try out.</p>
<p>This latter point is core to the Early Access experience. If you like the sound of Glum and want to support the devs as they bring it to completion then it’s well worth the price, but there can be snagging issues along the way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2235550/view/544485372295381678">A roadmap has been outlined</a> by CinderCat Games, with a festive clown-filled level, another arena mode, building up to a Halloween level this autumn.</p>
<p>It’s always important to know what you’re signing up for. In Glum’s case, I think there’s plenty of fun to be had in its current form and I will definitely be going back in for more once the extra levels are added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition to the UK government by the Stop Killing Games initiative</a> has passed the 100,000 signatures threshold to be considered for a debate in parliament. <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">A similar petition in the European Citizens’ Initiative</a> is also nearing its 1 million signature threshold to be considered by the European Commission.</p>
<p>The UK government already responded to the petition after it passed the 10,000 signature threshold in February, saying “We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.”</p>


<p>However, a debate in parliament is always good, and UK residents will be able to have their voices heard on the matter through their local MP – if this matters to you, then firstly the petition remains open until 14th July to add your signature and receive notifications, and you should try to get in touch with your MP to add weight to this argument. EU residents have until 31st July to help this petition cross the line.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a consumer movement that came into being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">after Ubisoft’s announced shutdown of The Crew’s online servers last year</a>, arguing that many modern games “are sold effectively as goods – with no stated expiration date – but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.”</p>

<p>In the interests of game preservation and of simply letting people continue to play the games that they have paid for, SKG hopes to petition lawmakers to implement rules to prevent publishers from effectively killing games. This is not a call to for publishers to support games and host servers indefinitely, or even to release source code,&nbsp;but rather to provide an end-of-life plan for titles with core online components that ensure that the game remains playable in some state. In SKG’s proposal, this would still enable subscription-based games, MMORPGs, free-to-play titles and the many business models and styles of game that publishers have created, and existing games would not be affected, but plans would need to be put in place for future games to have this end-of-life version to ensure an offline mode.</p>
<p>For more on this, and the various edge cases and counterarguments that have to be catered to, please see <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the Stop Killing Games FAQ</a>, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo">there’s some frankly bizarre and prehaps wilfully misconstrued pushback</a> which was recently addressed by SKG’s founder Ross Scott – this video arguably spurred these two petitions on to some semblance of plausibility.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we already have a practical example of how this is possible for publishers to do in the modern games industry, let alone with historical examples. Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>This should be the default course of action for companies to take, and we would encourage you to sign and follow these petitions, if you’re in the UK or EU.</p>

		<p>Blizzard has announced that WarCraft Rumble will not be getting anymore new content, though there will still be support to address bugs and in game events. While it is not explicitly stated, this move could be another fallout from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">mass layoffs affecting all divisions</a> that Microsoft enacted yesterday. The biggest hits of that was the closure of The Initiative and the cancellations of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Perfect Dark.</a> Everwild has also cancelled and there have been layoffs at Rare, Turn 10, and Halo Studios too.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard said,<em> “We have an important update on the future of Warcraft Rumble. After much deliberation, we’ve arrived at an extremely hard decision. Moving forward, we’ll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.  </em></p>
<p><em>Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team—some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with. Since launch, Rumble has struggled to find its footing relative to our ambition for its long-term success, and for some time now the team has been listening to player feedback, refocusing in certain areas, and exploring different options. Some of that work showed signs of progress, but ultimately wasn’t enough to put the game on a path to sustainability.  </em></p>
<p><em>During this transition, we are focused on supporting our teammates. We’re deeply grateful to everyone at Blizzard and in the community for helping bring Warcraft Rumble to life and embracing the joy that makes this game so special. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us.”</em></p>

<p>The Microsoft job cuts yesterday lead to 9,000 people losing their jobs across the company. We hope everyone impacted is able to find new roles soon. If you have been affected check out<a href="https://gamejobs.co/">&nbsp;GameJobs.co</a> for roles available in game dev.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two key parts of the creative team on HBO’s The Last of Us TV series have stepped away from the production ahead of Season 3. Neil Druckmann is leaving to focus on his work at Naughty Dog and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-next-big-game/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while the Last of Us Part 2 co-writer Halley Gross is also leaving the writer’s room.</p>
<p>Druckmann writes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/druckmann/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">social media</a>:</p>


<p><em>“I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative. </em></p>
<p><em>“Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">Gross says</a>:</p>

<p><em>“With great care and consideration, I’ve decided to take a step back from my day-to-day work on HBO’s The Last of Us to make space for what comes next. I’m so appreciative of how special this experience has been. Working alongside Neil, Craig, HBO, and this remarkable cast and crew has been life changing. The stories we told – about love, loss, and what it means to be human in a terrifying world&nbsp;are exactly why I love this franchise.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have some truly rad projects ahead that I can’t wait to share, but for now, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who brought Ellie and Joel’s world to life with such care.”</em></p>
<p>This leaves the show entirely in the hands of Craig Mazin to produce, direct and lead the writing of the last two seasons of the show. He had already shouldered the bulk of the adaptation through the first two seasons of The Last of Us, the sole writer on 11 of the 16 episodes released so far, with Druckmann writing one himself, and broader collaborations for the Season 1 opening and finale, and the final two episodes of Season 2.</p>
<p>The announcement has left viewers and fans of the game and show a bit unsure of how to feel. Similar to The Last of Us Part II as a video game, the narrative direction that featured in Season 2 of the TV series was less universally beloved than the first, but beyond still controversial narrative choices, it also had to contend with telling only a part of the second game’s story. In general, many are happy that Druckmann is able to focus his efforts on the Intergalactic, but there’s less consensus over Mazin’s adaptation of the second game.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
