		<p>Ubisoft has delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> once again, nudging the launch date back by around a month. The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows release date is 20th March 2025, the game coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Assassin’s Creed team, executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté said:</p>


<p><em>We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our incredible fans and dedicated teams for your unwavering support since our announcement in September to further refine and polish Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Accordingly, the new release date is</em> <strong><em>March 20, 2025</em></strong><em>. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams.</em></p>

<p><em>We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!</em></p>
<p>Previously planned for launch at the tail end of 2024, Ubisoft delayed AC Shadows to 14th February in the wake of a disappointing release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. “While the game is feature complete,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">Ubisoft said of AC Shadows in September last year</a>, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title.”</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<p>Grabbing an extra month for the final rounds of polish means that&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed Shadows is also avoiding going up directly against <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed</a>, both of which had shifted from their own late 2024 release plans – Avowed specifically trying to avoid other big game launches, and is now getting a bit lucky with that.</p>
