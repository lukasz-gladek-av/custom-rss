		<p>Yellow Brick Games has announced that an Eternal Strands demo is coming to PC via Steam on 21st January, giving a sneak preview of their magic-infused action-adventure game a week before the full release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 28th January – it will also be day one on certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on if a demo will also be coming to console, though <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874836069608522227">the team responded to a query</a> about this by saying “Steam only for the moment”, which implies it’s a possibility.</p>


<p>Eternal Strands will cast players as Brynn, a young Weaver seeking to recover her people’s cultural home, fighting enemies with a blend of magical abilities and weapons. Core to this, however, is a thermodynamic layer woven throughout the game world so that the elemental use of fire and ice can be applied to the environment to great effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Heat will spread, cold will chill, and there’s real-time destruction that goes hand-in-hand with telekinetic powers. You can, for example, set fire to a tree, then rip it out of the ground and hurl it at enemies with Brynn’s telekinesis. Alternatively, cast a magical ice wall to block incoming attacks, or infuse her sword with flames to waft at enemies.</p>

<p>Brynn is also inherently mobile, allowing her to face off against gigantic enemies that you’ll need to climb up, shatter armour to reveal weak spots, freeze to limit mobility, burn to clear fur, and more in order to defeat. Of course, the magic will also be useful for navigating the fantasy city.</p>
<p>It’s all a rather intriguing additional layer to the action-adventure formula, bringing more interactivity and emergent reactivity to the game. Definitely one to keep an eye on for later this month, as one of the earliest game releases of the year.</p>
