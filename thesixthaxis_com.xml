		<p>Anyone else have a flurry of snow this morning? It disappeared quickly, but it’s been right chilly this week, so I’ve had an extra layer to keep me cosy while playing games. And this week I’ve been juggling a bunch of games. There’s been more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> to eventually wrap up our review, there was an impromptu run-through of the still excellent Metroid Prime Remastered ahead of the new sequel, I had a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Nioh 3</a> to deliver for today, and I reviewed the rather enjoyable bullet heaven, tower defence mash-up of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/monsters-are-coming-rock-and-road-review/">Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road</a>.</p>

<p>Turning to the rest of us, <strong>Aran</strong> wrapped up his review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/17/umami-review/">Umami</a>, the intriguing 3D food puzzle game, and then made a start on Xenopurge for review, and Wuchang Fallen Feathers for pleasure. He’s already beaten the first non-optional boss and is feeling like he’s making some good progress at hitting things with a big sword.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> was lucky enough to get Ghost of Yotei for his birthday –&nbsp;happy birthday! – so he’s been playing that. “It’s very good!” he says. “At the moment, a few hours in, I slightly prefer it to the original.</p>


<p>Making it two ghosts in Yotei is <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s played that alongside Metal Gear Solid Delta’s Fox Hunt multiplayer and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. “Despite its limited offering, I’m having great fun with Fox Hunt, which crams the thrills of a battle royale/extraction shooter in a short-fire rounds, though Konami’s silence regarding future content is concerning in an age where publishers are quick to slap roadmaps all over their live service titles. Meanwhile, Black Ops 7 has been a mixed bag. It certainly lives up to Activision’s marketing as being the biggest COD to date, though I’m yet to gel with any of the game modes despite the gunplay being top tier.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had Sweet Surrender in for review, now that he’s returned home, and has two massive open world games on the go in the form of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, as well as some of the poker roguelite Balatro.</p>

<p><strong>Tuff</strong> is close to wrapping up our review of the breakout extraction shooter hit ARC Raiders, and <strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing a bit of that too, but he’s mainly been playing lots of Wuthering Waves, “because their latest update added a new explorable cyberpunk city with a capybara mascot which is all very targeted at me specifically.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s been a busy bee with real life, but snuck in a bit of throwback gaming to a decade ago by playing Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on Switch 2. It’s still good!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>
