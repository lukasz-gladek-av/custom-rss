		<p>Raw Fury has revealed two new games at the MIX Summer Game Showcase, with the tower survival action of&nbsp;Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, and the RPG hack-and-slash adventuring of Regions of Ruin: Runegate.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of R’s.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P33pMKtwmLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road from Ludogram takes a little bit of tower defence, bullet heaven and survival crafting, chucks it all in the pot, and stews up a game where your city on wheels has to keep on rolling down the road while blasting away at swarming hordes of enemies. All the while, your player character can run around gathering resources, while various safe zones give an opportunity for greater resource hauls and major reworks and upgrades to your fortress city.</p>

<p>It’s an intriguing looking game that absolutely feeds off the gaming zeitgeist, but could definitely find a healthy following. The game is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2934220/Monsters_are_Coming_Rock__Road/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and you can <a href="https://forms.gle/cGjyaUxZgoQdMgVm6">sign up to the closed beta here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Regions of Ruin: Runegate from Gameclaw sends your dwarven character off on a side-scrolling hack ‘n’ slasher to explore the shattered realms that were once rules by your people and restore them to their former glory. There’s a nice low detail pixel art style here.</p>
<p>It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1375750/Regions_of_Ruin_Runegate/">wishlist on Steam today</a>.</p>
<p>Elsehwere, Raw Fury also had new trailers for Craftlings, to mark the release of a demo for the resource management strategy game – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">check it out here</a> – and there’s a new intro trailer for Esoteric Ebb, the rather unusual RPG where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/esoteric-ebb-to-be-published-by-raw-fury-become-a-cleric-in-this-crpg/">you play a cleric in a city</a> and have all your decisions affected by the roll of a D20.</p>

		<p>During the State of Unreal conference today, CD Projekt RED showed a tech demo of The Witcher 4, and one of the most impressive things about is that this tech demo is running on a base PS5 at 60fps with raytracing. With this being a demo and the The Witcher 4 still in early development, this does not necessarily mean the final product will hit those same benchmarks.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - UE 5.6 Tech Demo | State of Unreal 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJtF3wzPSrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo shows us a first look at Ciri in action as well as the region of Kovir, mentioned in previous games and in the books, but this is the first time players will be able to explore the region. We are also introduced to Ciri’s horse, Kelpie, her pure black horse who seems to have a bit more personality than Geralt’s Roach. The new Unreal Engine 5.6 update adds some new things to the experience too, including nanite foliage and character motion matching so horse riding, for example, comes across as much more lifelike.</p>
<p>The world of The Witcher 4 is much more responsive to Ciri’s actions as well. In one part she bumps into someone carrying a box of apples. The person drops some apples, a child and some pigs notice, and run up to gather the fallen apples. The clip goes on to show larger crowds gathered in a market square to watch a performance, all fitting into the game without sacrificing the 60 fps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> was revealed in December with confirmation that Ciri would take the role of the lead protagonist. All we know is that this is the start of a new era for The Witcher series and it is set in Kovir. We do not have any details yet as to what has taken Ciri to Kovir or which characters will be returning in this sequel. A release date has not been confirmed either.</p>
