		<p>Hello Games has announced and launched a new update for No Man’s Sky, calling it Breach. The Breach Expedition is a limited time event that will run for three weeks, taking players to an abandoned universe filled with corvette wrecks that can be salvaged for parts. The end goal of the expedition is to find the Fireship Arcadia, but to get there players will need to venture into hostile environments including the purple star systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Breach Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNaY10DQkJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The purple star solar systems were first teased in the Worlds Part II update, and players venturing to these areas will need to be fully prepared as these are pretty hostile areas environmentally. The prizes of stripping the Corvette wrecks may be worth it though. Equipped with your multi-tool laser you will able to take parts from the wrecks and use them to build ships at a Corvette Workshop. The items you can get as scrap include landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and wedge-shaped modules. The rewards going into the Breach include Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars posters, Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates, the Atlas-themed Wings of Aeron wing module, the Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade,&nbsp; the decorative Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid, the Aeron Starship exhaust trail and the Aeron Powershield which can boosts your ship’s defences.</p>
<p>Fixes have also been released since the launch of Voyagers, with Hello Games improving snapping, making collisions more robust, and adding the option to apply a colour palette to a Corvette at the workshop.</p>
