		<p>Right out from the grand finale to Chapter 6, Fortnite has kicked into Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, starting a new era for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite-battle-royale">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> at the Golden Coast. This is more than just a bunch of new locations and branded tie-ins, though, with a clutch of core gameplay changes, including boss battles, simple build and self revives.</p>

<p>One change is how you drop into your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> match, with the Battle Bus now out of commission and Storm Surfing the way that you reach the Island instead. From there, the map has new POIs including Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, and Classified Canyon.</p>
<p>But really it’s all about the new gameplay tweaks and additions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv2zM8jI4gU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay in the Game&nbsp;– In the very rare occasion&nbsp;players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out).
<ul>
<li>Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move.</li>
<li>Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defeat the Boss, Be the Boss&nbsp;– Defeat bosses to claim their loot, powers, and transform into them! Becoming a boss grants full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a powerful ability. Careful: boss positions remain visible to nearby opponents at all times!</li>
<li>Simple Build&nbsp;– Simple Build is an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that makes learning how to build simpler. Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that the new battle pass has got a whole host of film references that 12-year-olds won’t really understand. The Bride from Kill Bill is turning up, katana in hand, and Marty McFly will bring 1980s chic to 2025 (a decade on from the “future” that he ended up visiting in the sequel).</p>
<p>This is all a little bit temporary, though. The Battle Bus returns on 4th December, at which point Reload will come back online with the Surf City map, Blitz Royale will have the new Starfall Island map, and ranked will also return. Fortnite OG will also return on 11th December with Season 7.</p>
