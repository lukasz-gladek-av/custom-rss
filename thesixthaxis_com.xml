<p>Day of the Shell: Prologue contains one world with 13 islands to explore, the revolver and crossbow weapons, 12 relics and nine blessings that can be combined, five enemy types, and seven runes that upgrade the main character’s passive abilities. The gameplay of Day of the Shell has been described as one click, one turn with each turn requiring one choice to keep the gameplay fast paced. The setting of the game is post apocalyptic following the gods destroying most of it and humanity, leaving a few islands for monster hunter Huntress to explore. The features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>One Click, One Turn: Tactical choices are made with a single click, making gameplay simple and dynamic while maintaining strategic depth.</em></li>
<li><em>Explore the Islands: Survive against monsters and collect treasures on each island to open its portal. Will you be able to reach the heart of the Islands and destroy the Shell?</em></li>
<li><em>Shape Your Destiny: Combine the powers of the many Warden’s blessings to fight your enemies. Different variations and combinations will allow you to create a unique playstyle for each game.</em></li>
<li><em>Death is Part of the Adventure: With each death, you return to your home island, where you can permanently upgrade or consider your strategy for the next day.</em></li>
</ul>
