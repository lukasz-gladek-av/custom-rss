            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In an era of hyper-specific genre blends and mashups – take the roguelike city-building bullet heaven of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/monsters-are-coming-rock-and-road-review/">Monsters Are Coming!</a>, for example – it’s always felt daft just how many games can end up lumped in with the Action Adventure label. Don’t pretty much all games feature action? Are you not always going off on an adventure?</p>
<p>Well, yes, but let’s peel that back a little further to just Action for the time being, where you can arguably focus more on the core gameplay, the responsiveness of the world that makes these games satisfying to play in the first place.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch’s sequel to its celebrated samurai sim evolves the open world action game formula that made Ghost of Tsushima such a hit. This is mainly thanks to the beefed up arsenal of vengeful protagonist, Atsu, allowing players to employ <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei’s</a> five melee weapons, pick off enemies from afar using ranged attacks, or quietly eliminate them without leaving a trace. Being able to seamlessly switch between these playstyles turns every encounter into its own unique encounter, supercharged by intuitive traversal mechanics and a core combat system that is easy to pick up though constantly rewards experimentation.</p>
<p>What really sells Ghost of Yotei is its approach to open world design. Where other game maps feel overwhelming, bloated, and artificially padded out with repetitive tasks, Ezo feels like more of a curated space where side mission, bounty, and activity has meaning. In other words, five years after the original game, Ghost of Yotei has been well worth the wait.</p>

<p><em>– Jim</em></p>
<h3>Ninja Gaiden 4 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>You know that bit from the movie Ratatouille where the mean food critic takes a bite of food so nostalgic and decadent that it makes him flash back to eating a beautiful meal at home as a kid? That’s the kind of experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/ninja-gaiden-4-review/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is. It’s a fully confident return to the fast, frenetic, flashy action gameplay that ruled the early 2000s gaming landscape. While so many modern games default to the slower and more methodical Souls-style combat, Ninja Gaiden 4 dares to ask “what if your parry button was also your attack button and you fought a twelve foot tall robot samurai within the first hour of the game?”</p>
<p>It’s an incredible experience that manages to feel like a perfect blend of the methodology of the original Ninja Gaiden games and the style of Platinum Games’ finest releases. You’ve got an overwhelming amount of weapons, tools, combos, specific inputs, and special abilities to chain together at your leisure. At the same time, you’ve got face-melting rock music, hordes of enemies, and jaw-dropping set pieces that keep the experience moving at a million miles a minute. It’s a beautiful achievement in action gaming that I’m desperate to see more of in the future.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Miguel</em></p>
<h3>Donkey Kong Bananza – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The crash ’em, bash ’em, smash ’em action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was a real surprise to find coming from the team that last made the much more technical and clinical 3D platforming of Super Mario Odyssey, but it’s just another showcase for the creativity and inventiveness that remains a hallmark of Nintendo’s platformers. Bringing DK back to be the star of a 3D platformer once more, Nintendo EPD Tokyo mined for new ways to use his raw power and strength. Literally.</p>
<p>Smashing up the world is a huge part of Donkey Kong Bananza, slapping his way through rocks and scenery to carve new paths through the environment, discover more secrets, and generally reshaping the environment. It’s easy to let yourself descend into a fugue state of just bashing everything in sight, and it can get pretty messy and feel uncontrolled because of it, but there’s still that 3D platforming mastery waiting for you to return to as DK and Pauline descend deeper and deeper to the world’s core and the mythical promise that awaits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Virtual Reality Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/game-of-the-year-2025-best-virtual-reality-game/</link>
            <guid>1393639</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we come up on a decade since virtual reality gaming launched to the masses, it’s hard to say that it’s really managed to burst out of its niche. Sure, there’s been hits like Beat Saber that have entered into the mainstream consciousness, and everybody know that Meta, PlayStation, Apple and others have headsets ready and waiting for them to buy, but VR gaming remains more of a passion project.</p>
<p>But passion projects are the ones that bring the greatest leaps ahead. It’s these games that continue to pioneer new ways to think about existing genres, where teams dedicate themselves to finding those little</p>



<p>On the surface, Reach looks like many other VR games with fairly generic visuals, but you really have to play it to appreciate what Dreams Elevation have done.&nbsp; A subset of nDreams, the team were set up to explore new ways of moving and interacting in VR, inventing subtle features and tricks that make traversing a VR world as smooth as butter.</p>
<p>“Reach raises the bar for VR gaming, and it’s a great reason to dust off your headset,” we said in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/reach-review-a-leap-ahead-for-vr-action-games/"> review&nbsp;</a>and that remains true, Reach is a VR game where you can parkour through vast caverns and fling yourself around like an acrobat without any motion sickness. Chaining together moves, including throwing your Captain America style shield,&nbsp; quickly becomes second nature and makes other VR games feel stilted and robotic.&nbsp; There were a few glitches at launch but these have been patched out, so you really should add Reach to your wishlist.</p>

<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h3>The Midnight Walk – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The first and most immediately noticeable thing about The Midnight Walk is its beautifully terrifying art style. It’s hard not to be impressed by the artistry, using actual, real-life clay to make a stop-motion video game is already quite the achievement, but to have it look so damn good and work well in VR is remarkable. You might be a little too busy to marvel at how impressive things are though, as it’s absolutely bloody terrifying. From the dark, dingy environments to the truly horrifying monsters that are stalking you, it’s an incredibly creepy and unsettling aesthetic that the music and sound design matches, as well.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re desperately trying to stay away from unspeakable abominations, you’re also trying to bring warmth back into the world with the help of Potboy, an adorable – in a Tim Burton kind of way – lantern who can help light things up a little for you. It involves a lot of walking, but in VR and in this world that’s plenty to keep you entertained, especially since there are horrifying monsters stalking you. Some of the puzzles are particularly creative as well, sometimes even unique, as you’re wrapped up in a wordless narrative that builds up to its emotional conclusion. The Midnight Walk is&nbsp;a game that really demonstrates how much of a difference playing in VR can make.</p>
<p><em>– Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Lumines Arise – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Tetsuya <span>Mizuguchi</span> has completed the circle of his synaesthetic gaming journey, reviving the block-dropping puzzle game of Lumines for a new generation. The PSP original was already an experimental blend of game, music and visuals, as your actions and progress fed new sounds and added layers to the ambient soundtrack, and Mizuguchi-san was able to explore them once more with Tetris Effect in 2018, able to take everything so much further thanks to the dawn of VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a> takes the lessons learned from Tetris Effect and folds them back into Lumines’ framework, expanding on the series’ formula, bringing new life and energy with it, and in the process, crafting another genre-defining puzzle game. As with Tetris Effect, it’s a game that you really want to experience in VR if you possibly can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is now back online after the servers were shut down for over two days while Ubisoft dealt with a massive security breach.&nbsp; In the evening of 26th December players began to notice billions of in-game currency being added to their accounts and super rare skins being dropping into their inventories. Other players were banned, and some were unbanned.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have now rolled back all the data so players should have the correct amount of in-game credit, known as Renown. They state that players may find themselves in a queue to get back in to the game.</p>


<p>The event has kicked off a war of words between various hacking groups who are claiming they are responsible, and also that one groups have stolen the source code for every Ubisoft game. These claims seem to be an exaggeration and probably not true.</p>
<p>However, there is evidence to suggest that Ubisoft were not hacked at all. It is reported that Ubisoft had outsourced helpdesk support to a company in India and that an employee there was bribed to give “Panel Access” to a third party. This then gave the third party access to user accounts, ban functions and other facilities. If this is true then Ubisoft were not hacked, it was bribery and human corruption that caused the issues.</p>
<p>It is also reported that another group is contacting people on Telegram claiming they have their personal details from hacking Ubisoft, and they are demanding money. This appears to be a scam and they have no connection to the group that breached the Rainbow Six servers. Ubisoft have, so far, not stated that any user data was breached.</p>

<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Konami’s Motoi Okamoto, producer of the Silent Hill franchise, has said that the company hopes to release a Silent Hill game every year.</p>
<p>“Following the release of&nbsp;Silent Hill 2&nbsp;in October 2024, we were able to deliverSilent Hill f &nbsp;​​in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track,” said Okamoto (via Google Translate). “We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We’re not sure how far we can achieve this, but we’ll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we’d like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant. We’ll do our best to provide you with new updates, so we hope you’ll wait a little longer.”</p>


<p>The announced games are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/19/silent-hill-townfall-is-in-development-by-no-code/">Silent Hill Townfall,</a> which is in development at No Code, and a remake of the original Silent Hill by Bloober Team is also in the works. There’s also the new Silent Hill film that was meant to be out in 2025, but that seems rather unlikely now.&nbsp; Bloober Team announced the remake of the first Silent Hill game in June 2025 and at the time said they had been working on for three years. Quite why Konami remade <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> first is a bit odd, but they must have had their reasons.</p>
<p>It seems that Konami are going to farm out the Silent Hill IP to different development teams to create games, so they may not all be in the classic Silent Hill mould.</p>

<p>Nick loved Silent Hill f and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">gave it 10/10 in his review.</a> “Silent Hill f isn’t just a return to form, it’s a landmark entry in the series. Konami. NeoBards and Ryukishi07 have knocked it out of the park. For me, this isn’t just Game of the Year material, it’s an integral piece of Silent Hill history.”</p>

		<p>This story has an update <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/rainbow-six-siege-hack-online-telegram-india/">which you can read here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>…..</p>


<p>The servers for Rainbow Six Siege X have been offline for over twenty-four hours after hackers managed to get into the hardware, gifting billions of in-game currency and unbanning players.&nbsp; The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status"> official Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp; server status page</a> is rather coyly calling this an “unplanned outage”.</p>
<p>The issues began late on the 26th December when players started noticing billions of currency, known as Renown, dropping into their accounts. Ubisoft’s anti-cheat software then started suspending accounts. Others found strange messages appearing on the side of the screen, or super-rare skins in their inventory.</p>


<p>Ubisoft have shut down all servers for all platforms and have posted a couple of updates. Firstly they say that no one will be banned if they managed to spend any of the credits they received, but a rollback of accounts is in progress to remove the pirate treasure.&nbsp; They also say the ban ticker that was turned off in an old update had been reinstated, but will now be removed again, and “an official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but it is not related to this incident.”</p>
<p>“A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes,”&nbsp;posted Ubisoft on X&nbsp; “The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more.”</p>
<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
