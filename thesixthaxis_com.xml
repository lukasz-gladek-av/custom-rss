		<p>The end of the world is nigh in Code Vein II, as the calamitous Luna Rapacis progresses and corrupts the Revenants who had, until this point, been able to live in harmony with mankind. But there’s still time to fix this. With a story that’s somewhere between Quantum Leap and X-Men: Days of Future Past, you need to jump back in time to visit and team up with Revenant heroes of a century ago, looking for a way to reawaken them in the present and stop what’s coming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">the original Code Vein</a> brought a whole host of interesting ideas to the Soulslike form, from the ability to jump between character build Blood Codes, to the Partner NPC characters that would fight alongside you throughout. And yes, it came with anime-style graphics too. The Soulslike subgenre already felt pretty full and saturated back in 2019, but now in 2026, it’s bursting at the seams with competition. Bandai Namco’s answer is to take the core of what worked well before, and then bring so, so much more player customisation to the table.</p>


<p>Code Vein II Producer Keita Iizuka explained, “Code Vein belongs to the soulslike genre, but even within the action RPG there are many more genres, for example, exploratory open world games. But there aren’t as clear-cut boundaries as before, I would say. So yes, probably you are right, it’s becoming even more competitive, however because of that, it’s very important for us to really be mindful of our strength. It’s because of their competition that we are more stimulated to create something even better. So that’s something that we have hopefully realised and achieved in this version.”</p>


<p>Take the Partner system in general. It’s still great to have another AI partner there to draw aggro from enemies, dish out some damage of their own, and be ready to revive you with a chunk of their own health should you fall –&nbsp;this Restorative Offering now puts them into a cooldown for a time – but now all of that is optional. This is now branded as Summoning, but you also have the choice to use Assimilation, to absorb you Partner and add their strengths to enhance your powers, stats and abilities. If you found the Partners a touch frustrating to in their behaviours before, then you can sideline them through the whole game now.</p>
<p>Iizuka-san explained, “The reason why we allowed Assimilation is because by just having two characters all the time for every fight, the fighting style became fairly set, so the Partner just takes on a certain role and the player would take a certain role. We wanted to remove that kind of boundary, so that’s why we have created the assimilation mode, to be able to really see the fights from a different angle.</p>
<p>“The emotional arc is an important one. So the characters, you will be able to really spend one-on-one time with them to learn more about their backstories, their emotions, really have very heartfelt conversations. So that’s something that we have really valued.”</p>

<p>You’ll spend time with these characters regardless of how you play. This new world and story sees your protagonist journeying back in time to team up with the Revenant heroes of legend, the Fallen Heroes of the Resurgence, and our hands-on saw us partnering with Josée Anjou back in the day. Battling alongside her through the Sunken City to find a source for the pollution within the Sunken Pylon dungeon that we played. Along the way, there’s various narrative interludes that explore Josée’s character, the relationship she had with her sister and what befell them.</p>
<p>“The preview that you have played focused on Josée’s as her main narrative of her arc,” Iizuka-san said, “but there are other arcs involving other characters, and the scenes that you would be able to experience. With the time travel axis as well, you would be able to go back in time and then meet the characters at different points in their lives, to change the outcome, but also to experience the weight of history as well. So I hope that the players get to enjoy that.”</p>
<p>Putting the narrative focus on a range of characters that aren’t your own is an interesting way to frame the story, especially with the potential to bounce back and forth between time periods, and it also makes sense with just how goofy you can make your custom character. There’s a huge range of visual customisation that lets you fully indulge your more absurdist impulses. Want to wear a top hat with a snowman sticking out the top of it? Well, I certainly did when fiddling with the character creator, and that’s just scratching the surface of what’s possible here.</p>
<div id="attachment_467552"><p id="caption-attachment-467552">Is that a snowman in your hat?</p></div>
<p>“It’s not something that we actively specifically ordered to the developing team […] but the customisation team really took on an active role in coming up with this even further evolved version of the customisation build system,” Iizuka-san told us.&nbsp;“ But something that, as a team, we were very conscious of, is that we wanted to deliver a system that is easy to build, customisable, and that the outcome is always great-looking anime-like characters. So there are many numbers of parts, but always the end result to something that is great. That is something that we want to aspire to create.”</p>
<p>The visual customisation is echoed within the combat builds, again taking the core of the ideas from the original Code Vein and expanding them greatly. The Blood Codes that you apply determine the attributes of your character through six categories, with the equipment and weapons that you then equip putting a burden on these figures, which can lead you to being overburdened and suffer penalties to your play, in turn pushing you to align your choice of weaponry and play style.</p>
<p>Talking about the new possibilities here, Iizuka-san said, “So we have added two new categories into the weapons, as well as two different drain attacks as well, and when it comes to Formae, there are many different varieties that we have added. So by combining them all, there are a lot more that the players could enjoy, so I hope they do.”</p>
<p>You’ll really want to make the most of your Formae abilities (formerly Gifts), the skills that you can use for offence or defence, building up to the Bequeathed Formae as your most powerful ability, summoning a special weapon to your hands to unleash hefty damage. That will require you to have enough Ichor, drawn from enemies by performing Jails (the rebranded Blood Veil) to drain their blood. There’s additional Boosters sprinkled on top for what is a particularly broad and complex system of stats, abilities and synergies for players to find.</p>

<p>It’s this depth of customisation that could end up being Code Vein II’s biggest strength. The Sunken Pylon dungeon felt a little by-the-numbers with its Soulslike structure and fairly samey abandoned, ruined industrial look. There is a more open overworld that can be navigated on a motorcycle, which I didn’t get to play, and I’d be curious to see just how the story handles bouncing between time periods and the character growth. There’s not too long to wait, though, with Code Vein II out later this month.</p>
<p>The opening of 2026 is a busy one for Soulslike fans, and Code Vein II is first in line with a refreshed take on the original’s anime visuals, more extensive character customisation, and a characterful time-travelling tale.</p>

		<p>If you’re reading this, then you’re surely wracking your brains and trying to remember all of the games that have been announced for 2026. Some of the big guns are easy to remember, and we’ll get to those later, but the breadth and depth of the games industry makes thinking of more than a dozen pretty tricky. So, we’ve opened up our book of dates, consulted with our filofax and card references, put boots on ground and feet up on desk, and come up with another five games you should keep an eye on. We have another ecletic mix of games from street racing to horror, sprinkled with some superheroes and supervillains beating each other up.</p>
<h2>35 – Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>

<h2>34 – Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 16th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Developer Big Bad Wolf is one of many game developers in recent years that has looked to Lovecraft for inspiration, and who can blame them when Lovecraftian horror has such an appeal to audiences? Big Bad Wolf’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-launches-an-occult-interpol-investigation-in-2026/">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> takes us to a future where in the year 2053 occult events are occurring more regularly, and the planet’s resources are scarce making companies explore the ocean floor for new opportunities. Unfortunately, those two events collide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThN3eSfWqUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss you play as occult investigator Noah who is investigating the disappearance of miners in the Pacific Ocean. This investigation leads Noah and his AI companion Key to the lost city of R’lyeh, where Cthulu’s influence is strong and will warp Noah’s mind too, affecting how you go about investigating clues and solving the puzzle of what’s happened.</p>
<h2>33 – Screamer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 23rd March 2026</em></p>
<p>Milestone is resurrecting the old street racing franchise <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/screamer">Screamer</a>, giving it a much-needed modern upgrade. It is an anime style arcade racer where teams compete against each other in fast cars to win races and take each other out, competing in a tournament to win some prestige and get some answers, which are much needed in the dystopian world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Screamer - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lh5ElfqaS74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, Milestone has announced five of the teams that make up the competitors including Green Reapers, Strike Force Romanda, Jupiter Stormers, Anaconda Corp, and Kagawa-Kai. Each team has its own distinct style, with each of the three racers in each team having their own cars to use, like colourful cars of Strike Force Romanda who are a former girl group. Screamer is standing out as an arcade racer to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2>32 – Tides of Tomorrow</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tides of Tomorrow - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVjNGNZcqHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h2>31 – The Blood of Dawnwalker</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a> is the first game from Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz along with CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Having such big names behind it, The Blood of Dawnwalker has high expectations placed on it as a new dark open world RPG.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coen is the main character and he is a Dawnwalker, making him part human and part vampire. He has come to be a Dawnwalker after a powerful vampire saves Coen’s sister’s life and takes Coen’s blood as payment. It is not a simple transaction as this vampire wants to rule over humanity. As the Dawnwalker, Coen has two different ability sets depending on the time of day. During the day, Coen is a human and is limited to human skills but at night he gains his vampire powers allowing him to enter different locations and use vampire powers in combat. The world reacts to Coen’s decisions and lack of decisions, shaping how dangerous it is him for him and the people he cares for.</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today, but come back tomorrow where we’ll make it up to the midway point of our Most Wanted games.</em></p>
