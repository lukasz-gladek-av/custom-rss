		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is exiting early access and getting its 1.0 release on May 22nd, PLAION and Wired Productions has confirmed. The big announcement is that when the game launches, all microtransactions will be removed. Players who have been part of the early access period and bought the in game currency will be able to spend it through the in game store. The in game store is not going to be available for those who did not take part in early access. The general DLC model will replace microtransactions.</p>

<p>Game Director Chris Mallinson, of developer Caged Element, said, <em>“We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal – along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on GRIP. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks was going to be a free to play title funded by microtransactions, though that has obviously changed. The main move to being a paid title means that Caged Element can include player hosted games with custom rules, private games, a free roam mode, and remove the third party account requirement. As the game transitions from free to play to paid, the game will be offline from May 20th to May 22nd. The launch price will be $15.99, 15.99€ and £12.79.</p>
