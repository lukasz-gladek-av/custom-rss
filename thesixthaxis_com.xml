<p>Road To Vostok is a single player experience set in a post apocalyptic border area between Finland and Russia, and the are is called Area 05. In this region, players need to learn to survive, loot items, deal with other survivors, and plan every step before heading to Vostok. Preparation is heavily encouraged because once the first steps are taken into Vostok there is no going back, as it is a permadeath zone. While there are story elements around the world, Road To Vostok is a primarily sandbox experience so players can experience their own stories. The game will also support mods so there may also be new stories to experience created by the community.</p>
<p>When Road To Vostok eventually gets its full release it will feature 10 Area 05 maps, 10 Vostok maps, 10 Crossing Points, 10 Shelters, three trader types including generalists, gunsmiths, and doctor, three enemy types including bandits, guards, and the military, special NPCs like driver, grandma, shaman, fisherman, and scientists, over 300 weapons, and over 30 weapons. Road To Vostok will be launched on PC first, but console versions are being considered. In terms of multiplayer, no PvP content is being considered but Road To Vostok may eventually get co-op depending on the success on the single player release.</p>
