		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum’s</a> latest update is out now, bringing a bunch of free new content as part of The Digiverse. Collect arcade cabinets, pixel art video game memorabilia, and the murky depths of a new Dredge collaboration with a new expedition map to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Update 5.0 | OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRBCcrB_4zk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Digiverse sees multiple rifts opening that you can send your curators through to explore, bringing back items to display that are all themed around Meat Wizard – I can’t tell if this is meant to be a lewd euphemism or not, but it feels like it might be – and indie hit Dredge. The former is all video game-y, while the latter adds new remote islands to reach and brings more variety to your maritime museums.</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the two sides of this update. For Meat Wizard you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a nostalgic trip into the County’s video game history<wbr></li>
<li>Adventure in Meat Wizard 1 &amp; 2, and perhaps discover the franchise’s darkest secret…<wbr></li>
<li>Discover seven new Exhibits across four new Points of Interest<wbr></li>
<li>Build two new Interactive Displays: Meat Wizard Arcade Machines<wbr></li>
<li>Find and unlock Power Ups, a new boon-giving project for the workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, for Dredge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore three remote points of interest across the archipelago &amp; unlock new decor<wbr></li>
<li>Dredge the depths to discover ten fresh catches. We’d advise you don’t set sail at night…<wbr></li>
<li>Fight the Unfathomable. Are your experts’ minds strong enough to gain knowledge of the depths?</li>
</ul>
<p>But it also just so happens to be the seventh anniversary of Two Point Hospital, where this studio’s life started. To mark the occasion, they’re bringing back the Blob Fish, which was added to the universe in the Exhibition pack for Two Point Hospital, and is now back to blob things up in Two Point Museum. Just head to the new&nbsp;<wbr>Temple of the Blobs, found southwest on the Bone Belt underneath Hermit Hills.<wbr></p>

<p>Further enhancements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added new perks for the Security Camera Booth, Bandage Box and Aquarium Filter:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Security Signal Boost: </b>Increases the range of connectivity with Security Cameras<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Bogs: </b>Allows Bandage Box to increase staff Toilet Comfort<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Brew:</b> Allows Bandage Box to offer coffee for staff<wbr></li>
<li><b>Extra Expert-Seas: </b>Experts gain additional XP during aquarium restoration<wbr></li>
<li><b>Focused Fish Food:</b> Reduces food dispenser Messiness (-5)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Self-Cleaning Water: </b>Increases Filter Power (+10)<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Expert subclasses are now viewable in expedition setup &amp; training<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ‘Call security’ button to the Goblin Statue<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some qualifications now add Fantasy Stats when a Fantasy expert trains in them:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Aerodynamics</b>: +3 Dexterity per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: +3 Intelligence per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Happy Thoughts</b>: +3 Luck per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Survival Skills</b>: +3 Strength per level<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…and much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Made a significant number of improvements to the gamepad UI<wbr></li>
<li>Added additional language support for LATAM Spanish, Russian and Thai<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Bean-Brained, Junk Foodie and Lard Lad/Lass traits so that they provide a long-lasting status effect instead of an instant increase to their respective stats<wbr></li>
<li>Space decorations will now give a decoration bonus to their respective subcategories<wbr></li>
<li>Improved the Security Room coffee machine and doughnut table so that they both fulfil their respective Food and Drink stats to 100% (Previously, they only added +15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Reduced the number of guests required to complete showcase exhibit objectives</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The update arrives not long after the first major expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds</a>. Laura had a grand time with this, saying, “Although Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds doesn’t come with an accompanying fantasy museum, the new Scorched Earth expedition map, exciting newfangled exhibits, intriguing fantasy Expert subclasses and great array of extra features and unlockables makes it a fantastic excuse to re-visit your favourite Two Point game. As if you needed an excuse…”</p>
