<p>MachineGames Audio Director, Pete Ward, guides us on this tour through the first person action adventure. While there’s some new clips and things to see, it’s fair to say that this video covers a fair bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-action-puzzles-exploration-disguises/">familiar ground from previous trailers,</a> including the figure of Tony Todd as a mysterious and very imposing antagonist right at the start of the game – who sadly passed away age 69 last week, making this game a posthumous appearance – and the companion character, photojournalist Gina, who teams up with Indy on the chase after Emmerich Voss who’s on a global hunt for otherworldly artefacts.</p>
<p>Indy has a camera of his own, using it to take photos of the world as you adventure, potentially getting clues from Indy as you do so. This fills in Indy’s journal, which will track the adventure so far and all the clips. You might also have to get your Agent 47 on with some disguises to get into restricted areas.</p>

<p>I got to go hands on with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle last month, and had a rather good time. Playing in first person (with a few snippets of third person) might be different from what you’d expect, given that Indiana Jones inspired the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, but it works. I said, “I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!”</p>
