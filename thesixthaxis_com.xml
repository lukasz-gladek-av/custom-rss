		<p>Publisher Wales Interactive and developer Trapped Predator have announced that the interactive psychological horror FMV game Heart of the Forest will be released on February 12th. The confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, PS4, Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android. It is a live action story that follows a group of students as they explore Germany’s Black Forest, which is home to an evil spirit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heart of the Forest - Official Reveal Trailer | Horror Games Award Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-MNjJEcHkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Heart of the Forest players will see the world through each character’s point of view, making choices on the information available to steer the story. Each character has their own fears and traumas that are exploited by the forest spirit to scare and hunt the students down. Your choices will determine who lives and who dies. Some of the footage definitely has The Blair Witch Project vibes, which is likely to have been an influence on Heart of the Forest.</p>
<p>In a statement Trapped Predator said, “<em>Heart of the Forest is our modern take on German folklore set in the mysterious Black Forest. In our debut title, we invite you to join our four protagonists on a chilling journey into their darkest nightmares. See you inside the forest!”</em></p>

<p>A price for Heart of the Forest is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>In the announcement post, Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire Editor In Chief, said, <em>“2026 is going to be an incredible year for Xbox players – you might even call it a… fabled year. To celebrate, we’re kicking it off with the fourth installment of our Developer_Direct broadcast on January 22, bringing you news, new gameplay, and insights directly from the incredible teams working on titles coming this year. Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life. Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup data-sleek-node-id="Me9CxY">th</sup> anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.”</em></p>
<p>The Xbox Developer Direct will be streaming on January 22nd at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK.</p>
