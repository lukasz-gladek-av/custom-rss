		<p>As we get back up to speed in 2025, our first What We Played of the year is more about 2024 and all the holiday gaming we snuck in over the past fortnight. Visiting family for Christmas meant I didn’t have the big consoles to play on, but that just meant I got completely hooked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">Balatro</a> for about a week. I clearly wasn’t the best boy in 2024, because Santa gave me the flu for Christmas, and along with the tail end of the NFL season, Retro Bowl was the perfect minimal thought game. I’ve now taken the Seahawks on a three-peat and am looking to right the wrongs of Atlanta Falcons history in my current season.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> holiday gaming has included a review of Threefold Recital and some more of The Witcher 3. There was also some more Football Manager 24, where he’s mounting a title challenge with Valencia and into the knockouts of the Champions League.</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> now on the hunt for a new headset, but that hasn’t stopped him from playing a bunch of games over the past couple weeks. He finished off the excellent Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, completing all of the side quests and achievements, and has moved on to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, “which is great but feels a lot less expansive than the first one as most action taking place in the one big open world planet so far.” He’s also finished 9 Sols, though this did mean dropping the difficulty down about two thirds of the way through.</p>
<p>While he’s got Cuisineer and Behemoth on the go for review, <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> Christmas &amp; New Year gaming has also included Black Ops 6 and started Dragon Age The Veilguard – “The latter is as magenta as it gets, but still seems good. The former is, indeed, a Call of Duty game.”</p>


<p>It was a very Bohemian Christmas for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s continued on his playthrough of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He did a bunch of errands and local mysteries, and has found that everything from eating food, to maintaining Henry’s gear and sparring with a weapons trainer is a bit of a time sink, but he’s enjoying it and is now pushing on with the main quest because he knows there’s a lot of new games coming soon!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played Skull &amp; Bones and….. he didn’t like it – “It looks and plays like someone knock off studio tried to make Black Flag, I really couldn’t believe a full priced game could look that ugly in 2024.” So he tried to have a better time with some Transformers: Galactic Trials, but this part racing game and part shooter “should live up to it’s name and be put on trial, sentenced and thrown in to a pit of Sharkticons. […] By far the worse game I have played in 2024 and thankfully, the last one.”</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> bought Animal Crossing New Horizons for his wife and they’ve been playing it together. “It’s not my usual speed of game, but it’s really cute and a nice thing to do together,” he said, though he’s no doubt a bit befuddled why they’re catching all these bugs and fish and then not turning them into armour.</p>
<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Reuben’s</strong> absolutely hooked on Marvel Rivals and is foaming at the mouth for Season 1 to start, and <strong>Dom’s</strong> basically just found time for some Overwatch 2, Snow Bros. Wonderland and Songs of Silence.</p>
<p>Now then, what did you play over the holidays?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-45-to-41.1073169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2025. Today, it is number 46 to 41, covering a range of tastes and styles. There’s racing, management, and a whole load of killing. Buckle up!</p>
<h2>45 – Kingmakers</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>The Medieval Era was a time of war of much warfare across the world, as different people vied for power and thrones. It would have been brutal and the only thing that would have made medieval warfare more brutal is guns. Kingmakers takes players back 500 years to medieval England, arming them with guns to change the course of history in attempt to stop the apocalypse in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers | Winter Games Expo Trailer - Early Access Release in Q1 2025 AD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXujvsd9C58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kingmakers mixes the action with strategy, as you will have a medieval army at your back. You will control where units go to head off enemy forces. To help them you have access to vehicles too, including a truck and an attack helicopter. Kingmakers will also have solo and co-op play too, and it is due out in Q1 2025 for PC.</p>

<h2>44 – Football Manager 2025</h2>
<p><em>PC, PS5, XSX|S, NSW, iOS, Android – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Football Manager 2025 is a departure for the long running management for a couple of reasons. First, it is actually releasing in the same year as its title, purely down to delays. Second, it is the start of a new era as the series is moving to the Unity engine. That means there are a number of changes coming to the series as a result.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First let’s talk about changes. The user interface is going to change to be more modern. Goodbye inbox and hello to more messaging instead.Women’s football is also being added to the game as well. Due to the change in engine, there are some features missing too. International management will not be part of the game, and touchline shouts have also gone, as well as create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. The Premier League license has been acquired though. The game is due out in March.</p>
<h2>43 – Killing Floor 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – March 2025</em></p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was announced in 2023, and it is coming nine years after Killing Floor 2. Much like the previous games, players will team up to take on an undead army of Zeds. Killing Floor 3 is set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, and the world is overrun by the Zeds. Players are part of the rebel group known as Nightfall.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teams of five will face the relentless waves of Zeds, unlocking skills and weapons to survive the dystopian setting. Some of the classes confirmed are the medic, the sharpshooter, and the ninja, There will be some closed beta tests ahead of Killing Floor 3’s full launch in March, and you can sign up for your chance to take part on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor 3 website.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>42 – Assetto Corsa EVO</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) – 16th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Much like the name suggests Assetto Corsa EVO is an evolution for the racing simulation franchise, as it will have an open world. This open world is set in the region of the Eifel region of Germany, home to the world famous Nürburgring. The map will eventually grow to cover 1600 square kilometers, all of which laser scanned to recreate an accurate portrayal of the region.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like its predecessors, Assetto Corsa EVO will feature a range of cars, including road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars. Each one of these have been recreated digitally using laser scans to make sure all of their details will be captured right down to the smallest.</p>
<h2>41 – Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap is one of the other earliest games on our release list, coming out later this month. Much like the previous games in the serious, players will be fighting waves and waves of orcs. You are one of the War Mages, each of which have their own skills to master. You can play the game solo or co-op of up to four players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another new addition to the series through Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap are the roguelite build options, meaning no runs will be the same as another. There will be random buffs and debuffs that will impact heroes, traps, weapons, stats, and the levels as well. These will stack too and you will have to decide to keep pushing forward or go back to the castle to improve your character and their stats.</p>
