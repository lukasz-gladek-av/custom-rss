			<p>If I were to ask you to imagine a well-groomed, moustachioed gentleman from Belgium who constantly comments on his “little grey cells”, you wouldn’t have to be an Agatha Christie super-fan for the famously meticulous detective, Hercule Poirot, to come to mind. Of all Christie’s characters, Poirot still proves to be incredibly popular today, with the Kenneth Branagh movie series, the new Poirot mystery novels written in the Christie style by author Sophie Hannah or, of course, the continuation of the Microids video game mysteries. The latest instalment, Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile, offers a twist on the Christie classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6M4S0H1NL0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new take on the well-known story is set against the lively backdrop of the 1970’s. Christie fans may find the 4-decade time jump a little jarring. The luxury and opulence of the late 1930’s are swept away and replaced with, well, brown. When one visualises the style of the 1970’s, you might imagine bold patterns and prints in vibrant golds, mahogany browns, avocado greens, rich reds and burnt oranges. Unfortunately, in Death on the Nile, the 70’s eclectic mix of earthy hues translates as a muddy sepia mush of yellowish browns. The visuals, that at times should be very striking, get lost in a mix of flat, bland tones.</p>



<p>Poirot himself seems to sit a little out of place against the 70’s setting, as well. In the opening scene alone, Poirot visits a trendy nightclub where he meets the main characters featured in the upcoming mystery. Setting Christie’s dignified and meticulously groomed detective in a disco-era club with flashing lights and mirror balls is a bold and risky choice – one that doesn’t really pay off. You’re exposed to Poirot in bellbottoms and a neck scarf. This is accompanied by an awkward shot panning up past Hercule’s bottom that makes you feel like you’re eyeing up your grandad. There was one terrifying moment, walking onto the dance floor, where I thought I might be forced to watch Hercule Poirot break out into the YMCA. #notmyPoirot!</p>

<p>However, the 70’s setting does allow for the introduction of an interesting new aspect to the story with the original character, Jane Royce. In Death on the Nile, the gameplay is split between old-school detective Hercule Poirot and his admirer-come-private-investigator, Jane. The joint protagonist feature adds a fresh perspective to the crime and spruces up the all-too-familiar storyline. The plot promises an additional finale act that introduces something novel to the narrative. Where Poirot’s investigative play-sections feel like going over old ground for Christie fans, Jane Royce’s segments bring the excitement of exploring new territory.</p>

<p>When it comes to solving the mystery itself, the gameplay mechanics utilised here are inventive and well-thought out. The mind-map allows you to do more than just follow hints on who to interview next. It prompts you to make links between clues and draw your own conclusions. It keeps track of your discoveries and helps you decide where to look next. Cleverly, the game also comes with several helpful difficulty settings, from a fully guided mystery through to “throw you in at the deep end”, so gamers can choose their own path. This combination of techniques really immerses you in the mystery and urges you to properly don your detective baker boy hat.</p>
<p>As you near the end of each individual mystery, you’re treated to a run-through of events. First, the game prompts you to scroll through the timeline, placing characters in different locations performing different activities. Along with being enlightening, this activity is immensely satisfying. Particularly when you finally manage to get everyone in place to make the crime make sense. The game then runs through the case step by step and you get to watch the scene play out. Mystery solved. This leaves your investigative urges fully quenched and your face doing that smug expression it does when you feel you’ve just achieved something awesome.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to like about this game, from its immersive mystery-solving tools to its updated plot add-ons. However, it would have needed a more traditional 30’s setting and conventional Poirot character for it to truly spark my little grey cells.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Although the new 1970’s setting and bland, dark visuals leaves Poirot a little out of place, Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile gives video-gaming detectives a fresh perspective on a well-known plot and some fantastic mystery-solving menus and maps to get stuck into.	</p></div>
