		<p>Turn 10 has announced the end of active support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/forza-motorsport-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Motorsport</a>, two years after the game’s release, with no more plans to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or make regular bug fixes.</p>
<p>The game will go into a more basic support mode, so online servers will remain active, there will be special events and competitions in game, but the live service content beyond that will see Featured Tours and reward cars being recycled month-to-month. We’d expect them to tackle any critical issues with patches as well.</p>


<p>The team writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport. However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime.</p>
<p>We hope you continue racing with us on Forza Motorsport in 2026 – see you at the track!</p></blockquote>
<p>This announcement was somewhat inevitable after Microsoft chose to gut the studio earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">laying off roughly half the team</a> during a wave of layoffs across the gaming business and company as a whole. This was a result of a fairly underwhelming release for the latest Forza Motorsport, which had been years in the making and sought to bring the series up to the level of Gran Turismo and others as a longer-term racing game platform. Following the game’s release in 2023, they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/09/heres-how-forza-motorsport-car-progression-is-changing-in-march/"> overhauled car progression</a>, added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/forza-motorsport-update-adds-road-atlanta-circuit-and-multi-class-racing/">major new track and multi-class racing</a> and more, but it wasn’t enough to keep the studio secure.</p>

<p>It means that all that remains of what was a staple of the simcade racing genre will be the more arcade open world action of Forza Horizon, which is heading to Japan with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a> next year.</p>
