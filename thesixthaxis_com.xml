		<p>Pokémon Pokopia, the cosy Pokémon life-sim, is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 5th March 2026, Nintendo has announced.</p>
<p>Pokopia is a thoroughly odd feeling spin-off to the Pokémon franchise, as the shape-shifting Pokémon Ditto transforms into a human form – something which for a long time was said to be impossible, but is now a potentially horrifying reality with that blank line-art smile beaming back at you – and then sets about creating a little Pokémon paradise. They can do that, because Ditto will learn &nbsp;new abilities and moves from other Pokémon, perhaps spreading Bulbasaur’s vine whips to do a bit of gardening, and more.</p>


<p>It certainly looks like a Pokémon flavoured take on Animal Crossing, bringing other Pokémon to your corner of the world to hang out and engage with. Check out the original announcement trails from last month’s Nintendo Direct stream:</p>

<p>Pokémon Pokopia is now available for pre-order, with those that pre-order or buying the game shortly after release getting a Ditto rug to use for decorating their new home.</p>
