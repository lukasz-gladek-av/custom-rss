		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </a>advert that screened on YouTube and on streaming services for ITV and Channel 5 has been banned by the UK’s advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).</p>
<p>The ad shows a ‘replacement’ airport security guard frisking a man and asking him to remove “everything but the shoes”, before a female guard snaps on a rubber glove and gleefully adds, “Here comes the puppet show.”</p>


<p>The Advertising Standards Authority received nine complaints from people who believed the ad trivialised sexual violence.</p>
<p>The ASA acknowledged that there was no explicit imagery in the advert, but the humour was “generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man”.</p>

<p>They concluded the advert “trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive.”</p>

<p>Activision has clarified that the advert was not shown around children’s programming. Black Ops 7 has a PEGI 18 rating for “graphic violence, decapitations, dismemberment, strong language,” so it should not be sold to children.</p>
<p>We scored Call of Duty : Black Ops 7 a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">6/10 in our review.</a> “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>“It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>
