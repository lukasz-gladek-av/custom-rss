		<p>Steam Next Fest has been bubbling up behind the scenes all week, with so many game demos and announcements coming that I’m not even really sure when it’s starting. Some demos are out now, others are being run over the weekend, more are only coming out on Monday… but it means that if you have a PC and want to see what’s coming soon, you’ve got plenty to see and play this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of that, Dom and I played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/">RoadCraft</a>, a disaster recovery spin-off to the MudRunner series that really makes you feel like a kid in a sandpit. Add to that a game that would be Indiana Jones’ favourite management sim, and that’s my week of games.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> ramping up his gaming again, since his return from the other side of the planet. He enjoyed his time with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/">Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog</a>, a sci-fi visual novel, but this weekend has Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii booked in for review.</p>
<p>The love hate relationship with Alan Wake 2 has continued for <strong>Jim</strong>, who hit a roadblock with The Lake House DLC – “It solidified my opinion that while great at piecing together weird and compelling stories, Remedy doesn’t know how to pair this with interesting gameplay. It’s a shame as the final DLC is arguably the creepiest, zaniest part of the AW2 package – I just felt burned out after already putting some twenty something hours into the base game. I’ve now moved onto A Plague Tale: Innocence, hoping to wedge in a playthrough before Monster Hunter Wilds launches.”</p>


<p>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope would score highly on a password complexity checker, and it scores highly in <strong>Ade’s</strong> finely tuned “good game” checker as well – “It’s a brilliant TBS game, accessible, fun, and perfect for a quick half hour of gaming.” He’s also had some fun times blast giant bugs in the cities of Helldivers 2 this week.</p>
<p>Bemoaning the difficulty of trawling the PlayStation Store sales of full game gems – all the DLC listings just clutter up the joint, don’t they? – <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a broad spread of games to play this week, including the Tomb Raider 4-6 remakes, Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and Palworld. But he also did the important thing and grabbed a month of Game Pass in order to play Avowed… and about 15 other games on there that he was curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played “the forbidden game” of trying to do his marking and being a dad taxi to his kids. In video games, he finished off Gears 5 and got through most of Hivebusters DLC, but found the game endings have sort of petered out and left too many threads dangling. So he moved on to play Eternal Strands, which has been enjoyable, and is checking out a bunch of demos from Steam Next Fest, with a good few write ups to come.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, as always, been playing Destiny 2.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>
