<p>The description for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction says, <em>“As Eternia prepares for the Royal Festival of Light, Hover Bots attack the palace, revealing the dastardly plan: Skeletor and his allies kidnap King Randor and Queen Marlena and steal the Dragon Pearl! At Castle Grayskull, Skeletor drains the Sorceress’ power into the Pearl, shattering it across the kingdom and leaving her weak. Our heroes, He-Man, Teela, and Man-at-Arms, pursue him across Eternia in this authentic 16-bit tale of sword and sorcery, one 40 years in the making!”</em></p>
<p>For She-Ra fans, worry not as she is an unlockable character that can be used in the campaign. Each character has their own fight style, and He-Man can even ride Battle Cat into battle to take on Skeletor’s minions. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction will feature 12 stages to play through with two player local co-op supported. The game has been confirmed for PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

		<p>Total Mayhem Games has announced the next entry into the We Were Here series with the reveal of We Were Here Tomorrow. We Were Here Tomorrow is its own standalone entry in the series, and does not have story links to the previous games. It also features two player online co-op so players can work together to explore the mysterious facility they find themselves in.</p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here Tomorrow - Official Announcement Trailer | Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEruovfOaKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for We Were Here Tomorrow says, <em>“In this next standalone entry of the We Were Here series, you and your partner wake up inside a mysterious facility. Strange machinery surrounds you, and a calm, confident voice guides you through a series of assignments. Often separated and equipped with different tools, you’ll need to rely on your walkie-talkies to communicate clearly and work together. Each assignment introduces new asymmetrical puzzles that can only be solved through cooperation with your fellow explorer. As you progress, you’ll slowly uncover why you ended up here and what your role is within the facility. Only by working together can you decide the fate of Tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p>Aside from the two player co-op, We Were Here Tomorrow will also feature asymmetrical puzzles, the two characters having distinct roles and abilities, and a facility that has a retro-future design to it. We previously reviewed the last entry to the series <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/08/we-were-here-forever-review/">We Were Here Forever</a>, and in our review Stefan said, <em>“We Were Here Forever certainly grew on us the more we played, with some great brain-teasing puzzles that really make the most of the split player perspectives (though we did give up on the walkie-talkies).”</em></p>

<p>We Were Here Tomorrow is going to release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with an aim of releasing this year but a concrete date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
