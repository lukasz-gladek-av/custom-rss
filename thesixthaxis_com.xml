		<p>Cast your mind back to the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox One and there was big kerfuffle when certain companies were found to be making CG render trailers of what was meant to be gameplay, and the game usually turned out looking nothing like the renders. These days every game gets announced with a CG trailer and that means you don’t need to have finished the game, or in the case of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, maybe not even coded a single line.</p>
<p>It turns out the new studio that is making the game was formed just this year and given AAA games take at least four or five years to make these days, you probably won’t be seeing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic until the next decade.&nbsp; That is if it ever gets made, Star Wars titles announced at events have a solid track of vanishing in development hell.</p>


<p>Star Wars: 1313 was announced at E3 2012 and was cancelled a year later. Star Wars: Eclipse was announced by Quantic Dream in 2021 and we have not seen a single thing about the game since then. Then we have Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic – Remake which was revealed during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021 with Aspyr developing the title. Since then it seems there have been studio troubles and rumours suggest the entire game was scrapped and now Mad Head Games are on the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> was announced last night at The Game Awards 2025.</p>

<p>“Being set in the past gives us an immense amount of open space to tell new original Star Wars stories, while staying true to the spirit of the galaxy we all love. There are, quite literally, infinite stories to tell. While we will always honor and celebrate the core saga, it’s crucial to explore new territory, meet new characters, and see new parts of the galaxy,” said VP and GM of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly.</p>
