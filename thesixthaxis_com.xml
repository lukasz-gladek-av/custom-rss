		<p>It seems the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> release date has leaked, the game set to launch on 15th May 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and naturally day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The leak has seemingly come from an article that was briefly posted online by Gamekult, spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">Resetera</a>, who may have been briefed ahead of time on the content of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">Xbox Developer_Direct stream that will take place tomorrow</a>, Thursday 23rd January.</p>


<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>
<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them ahead of expected launches in 2025, and alongside Doom: The Dark Ages, it will be visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and one final surprise studio and game reveal – there’s been lots of rumours for an Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake…</p>

			<p>Mobile gaming has for a long time been the most accessible route into video games, and while that used to mean Candy Crush or Angry Birds, the last 12 months have seen the arrival of big hitters like the explosive anime action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a> and the glamorous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/">Infinity Nikki</a>. Netmarble are hoping to continue that trend with the stunning Game of Thrones Kingsroad, the latest entry in George R. R. Martin’s saga.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set to release for PC, Android and iOS, we were able to go hands-on with the latest beta to see just how faithful Kingsroad is to the previous Westeros adventures. Set amongst the melee following Robert Baratheon’s death, you are the bastard child of House Tyre, called north to find out why the Castle Black, home to the Night’s Watch, has gone silent.</p>


<p>You choose initially from three different classes: the Sellsword, a heavy fighter class with a massive axe, the Knight, a classic balance of offence and defence, and the lithe Assassin, a swift and deadly option.</p>
<p>Before you can say “Hero Journey”, you’re swept north of the Wall to seek out Jon Snow and a batch of missing Rangers. It does not go well, and you’re soon fighting off wave after wave of vicious White Walkers. Netmarble have done a fantastic job of capturing the skeletal foe’s terrifying presence, and if you were a fan of the original show, or indeed the actual novels, I think you’ll be all-in from the opening of Kingsroad.</p>


<p>The action-heavy gameplay relies on heavy-hitting melee combat, and your character is equipped from the start with a standard and heavy attack, as well as a bow for more delicate ranged work. They’re joined by a steady flow of skills and abilities, which are perfect for giving you the upper hand when facing the enormous swing of an undead Giant.</p>
<p>This definitely isn’t a Soulslike, but blocking and dodging play an important role in staying alive. It’s approachable and weighty, and, playing with a controller on PC at least, it feels responsive and like a fully-fledged action title rather than a stereotypical mobile game. Times have absolutely changed, and from the opening at least, Kingsroad is exceeding expectations.</p>

<p>The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos.</p>
<p>Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes. Jon Snow looks like Jon Snow – though he doesn’t sound quite right, shorn of Kit Harrington’s performance – and your player character boasts plenty of detail, really bringing the brusque, frosty action to life. The voice acting overall is actually a highlight, with a few moments of wondering whether it’s the original actors or not making way for the enjoyably northern accents that you encounter here in the snow.</p>

<p>Today is the final day for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s open beta</a>, so, if you were lucky enough to nab a spot, there’s still time to jump in and experience Netmarble’s fresh take on George R.R. Martin’s world. Hopefully, we won’t have too long to wait before the game’s full launch, and we can see how just how long and bloody that Kingsroad is.</p>
