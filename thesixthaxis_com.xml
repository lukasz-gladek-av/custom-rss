		<p>Jumping out of the Netflix animated movie and into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the KPop Demon Hunters have arrived for some Demon Rush, a new Halloween month riff on Horde Rush.</p>
<p><iframe title="KPop Demon Hunters Takes Over Fortnite" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>KPop Demon Hunters has been a huge hit on Netflix, an animated movie from the studio behind Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse that sees a trio of demon hunting KPop stars face off against demons that are now starting to fight them at their own game. It features the performances of Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice for the musical numbers, with the film’s soundtrack having plenty of success in its own right.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;Demon Rush is a limited time event, a revamped version of Horde Rush that sees Rumi, Mira, and Zoey fight endless waves of demons, and with KPop Demon Hunters inspired perks to use. The mode is available from 2nd October through 1st November.</p>
<p>Of course, this spills over to the Battle Royale and Blitz modes, with Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits, accessories and emotes in the Fortnite Shop, and new new items available by completing quests including Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>

<p>And the tie in also extends to both Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative, using the assets for this movie tie in for their own creations.</p>
