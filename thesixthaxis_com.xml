		<p>Today, we’re rounding off the first 20 games in our Most Wanted of 2025 series, counting down from 35 to 31. There is a good mix of games in the list below from psychological horrors and the fate of some giant robots, to a fresh take on a belove musou franchise. Let’s dig in, shall we?</p>
<h2>35 – The Alters</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live with yourself? It is a question you may have pondered? Would your copy be exactly like you, or look like you but have a different view of things. Enter The Alters, 11 Bit Studios new psychological survival horror in which that question is answered, though in a very stressful environment that will push anyone to their limits.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are Jan and Jan and Jan and Jan and, well you get the idea. Jan is a space builder trapped on an alien planet. He wants to get home but to do that he has to survive and restore his ship. It is a job he cannot do alone, but he can create Alters of himself. They are clones but with their own personalities, wants, needs, and stress points. If you don’t manage each individual’s needs or meet their expectations things will get tense, and the Jans will turn on each other. Probably not wise to say something like “Sure, Jan” sarcastically.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/the-alters-demo-pc-xbox-ps5/">The Alters demo</a> is available now.</p>
<h2>34 – Sleight of Hand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC, Game Pass – TBC</em></p>
<p>Sleight of Hand has one of the best descriptions going for it, with developer RiffRaff Games calling it a third-person card-slinging occult noir stealth sim. What more could you want? You are Lady Luck, an occult detective and former witch, who is taking on one last job. A job that has her meeting her past head on as she is tasked with going to Steeple City and bringing down her former coven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sleight of Hand Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBHg3xKnYTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The card slinging element comes from one of the core game mechanics, which are Lady Luck’s cards. She has cards imbued with magical abilities that can be used for all sorts, like creating a smokescreen, use smoke based attacks, and set traps. There will be different cards to use, allowing you to customise your deck which in turn determines your playstyle? Will you favour stealth cards or more attack based cards. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will be on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<h2>33 – Slay The Spire 2</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 has a lot of expectation behind it after the original was received so well. This is a sequel removing itself from any narrative connection to the first game by being set 1000 years later, introducing a new cast of slayers that are equipped with their own cards, as well as new archetypes to master.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 will change on every run, and you will have to deal with the foes and challenges that are thrown in front of you with the cards you have. You will need to build and rebuild your decks until you have a set that can master some of the tougher challenges ahead. Slay The Spire 2 is planned for Steam Early Access early this year.</p>
<h2>32 – Transformers: Reactivate</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – TBC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers: Reactivate was announced for consoles and PC</a>, at the tail end of 2022 during The Game Awards. The game is a 1-4 player action game. It was revealed through a cinematic trailer showing no Transformers in action, but from the point of view of what we assume are fallen Autobots, who have met their match against an enemy called The Legion. This is not about protecting Earth from an invasion, because it has fallen to The Legion already. Instead, it seems this is about resistance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TRANSFORMERS: REACTIVATE Official Announce Trailer | The Game Awards" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Transfomers Reactivate there have been precisely zero major updates. First the closed beta for 2023 did not take place, and the game is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Maybe, we’ll hear more in 2025 and get a surprise release?</p>
<h2>31 – Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 17th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a major refresh for the Dynasty Warriors series, taking it right back to its roots. Players are a nameless warrior that has lost his memories, and is thrust right into China’s Three Kingdom’s period. It is a time of war and strife with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Chibi taking place.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not just about taking out thousands of enemies in a matter of minutes using loads of different combos and skills. There is also an RPG side to it. As you complete missions and tasks you will earn XP, which in turn translates to your character rising up the military ranks and earning new skills. You will also build bonds with other characters. There are a lot of new things that even veteran fans of the series will discover, and Dom wrote about them after spending four hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game recently, ahead of the demo release, saying that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors Origins takes the series back to its roots to find its future</a>.</p>
<p><em>Another batch done, we’ll see you tomorrow for five more!</em></p>
