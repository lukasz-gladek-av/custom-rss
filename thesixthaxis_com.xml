		<p>Zynga has announced that it will be shutting down Star Wars Hunters on October 1st, with the final season dropping on April 15th. The shutdown will come near enough four years after Star Wars Hunters first soft launched, which occurred in November 2021 in some countries. The game then released worldwide in early 2022. The full statement regarding the shutdown can be read below.</p>

<p><em>Dear Hunters,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your incredible support and for being part of the world of Vespaara. After careful consideration, we want to let you know that the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters on all platforms will be on April 15th. The game will remain playable until October 1st, 2025, when the game’s online servers will be shut down.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.</em></p>

<p><em>Please find below a few important dates regarding this announcement.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>March 25th, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. We will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 15th, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the battle as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. We will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>October 1st, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey and for the time you’ve spent playing Star Wars: Hunters.</em></p>

<p>The FAQ regarding Star Wars Hunters shut down has confirmed there will be no refunds for purchases of the Arena Pass and Crystals, with players instead encouraged to use all the items they have before the game closes. The game will remain downloadable from app stores until October 1st.</p>
