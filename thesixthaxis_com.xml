		<p>Last night’s Xbox Developer Direct stream was pretty good, wasn’t it? I’ve come to enjoy the way that Microsoft presents these, giving the spotlight to a small selection of games that are locked in for the year ahead, and always with one smaller surprise along the way. The most exciting thing was to really see and hear about Playground Games’ take on Fable, though, which looks like it’s going to capture so much of the British charm and whimsy.</p>
<p>But what about the games we can and are playing in the here and now? Well, I’ve made a belated start on Rennsport, setting up my racing wheel to dip a tyre into this racing sim. I’ll have some thoughts to share on it in a review at some point.</p>
<p>We’ll start with Dom this week, who’s been getting his blacksmithing skills up to snuff in Bladesong, enjoying its unusual atmosphere and feel, as well as playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes and Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2 for our reviews. He’s also somehow ended up checking in each day on a new Animal Crossing island. He says “somehow”, but this was totally my fault for needing a buddy to try out the new online features…</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hopping around on rocks this week, but has been doing so while embodying an adorable fox and getting lost while playing Spirit of the North 2 with Ade. <strong>Ade</strong>, meanwhile, has mostly been enjoying Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 6 – “With the launch of season 6, the game is the best it’s ever been. Faster gameplay, silky smooth animation, punchy and responsive combat, and a nerfed Daredevil. For anyone who understandably bounced off the rather rough version of Marvel Rivals we got at launch, it’s definitely worth a revisit.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> is coming to the end of two games, reaching the summit of Cairn for our upcoming review, and coming to the conclusion of Ghost of Yotei which (and he can’t believe he’s saying it for an open world game) is actually too small.</p>

<p>MIO: Memories in Orbit largely delighted <strong>Aran</strong> for our review this week, with just some frustrating patches getting in the way of a visually stunning and challenging game. Now he’s gone back to Star Wars Outlaws to roam Tatooine, searching for treasure, and making mischief.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has hopped back into Last Epoch this week, and thinks ” it still has the coolest skill system of just about any game I’ve played. Being able to respec constantly is also very soothing for my poor addled brain.”</p>
<p>Playing Xbox but on PS5 is still a bit strange, but it has meant that <strong>Jim</strong> has been able to drop into Sea of Thieves, matchmaking with crews to go on voyages, and experiencing Hellblade 2 this week. “I’m just the past the halfway point and while I enjoyed the opening hour or so, this middle portion has really dragged with boring, drawn out environmental puzzles that act as filler between the occasional bout of combat.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> found it a bit tricky to focus this week with his gaming, jumping into the “shameless RE ripoff” of Ebola Village, bouncing off Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and loading up Gigasword as a bedtime Steam Deck game. He’s also set to explore the weird world of game streaming soon with some upcoming horror games, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Miguel</strong>, who’s been playing a bunch of Code Vein 2 for our review next week, a sprinkling of the silly co-op of The Outlast Trials and Peak, and getting his extraction shooter fix with Synduality: Echo of Ada.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/23/26-of-the-biggest-ps5-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1414063</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What are the biggest PS5 games coming out in 2026? It’s a busy year ahead that will feature a bunch of first party exclusives like Marvel’s Wolverine, plenty of Xbox-published games like Fable and Forza Horizon, and will build up to the juggernaut launch of Grand Theft Auto VI in November.</p>
<p>There’s tons of games on the way, but we’ve tried to pare it back to just the biggest launches.&nbsp;We’re breaking this list into two parts, starting off with games that already have scheduled launch dates, with most of those set to arrive in the first half of 2026 because of that, before switching gears for the games coming to PS5 that are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<h2>Scheduled Game Launches</h2>
<h3>Code Vein 2</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>


<p>The anime soulslike returns, with Bandai Namco looking to follow up on the popularity and success of the 2019 original. They’re stepping into a much more hotly contested genre than they were last time, but that allows them to burrow down into what specifically made their first game well regarded, and expand and improve on other ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulslike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So let’s start with what worked. The AI companions are returning, but this time they’re heroes from the past that you are jumping back in time to fight alongside and seeking to really learn their backstory and lives. They’ll fight alongside you, but you can also now absorb their essence to power up your core character, which is great when the AI behaviours got on a few players’ nerves in the past. This one’s out really soon, so keep an eye out for our review!</p>

<p><em>Catch our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/05/code-vein-ii-preview-anime-soulslike-of-future-past/">Code Vein 2 preview </a>from the start of this year here.</em></p>
<h3>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, NSW, PC –&nbsp;5th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Square Enix know a thing or seventy-two about remastering their classics, and it feels like every remake and remaster takes a different approach to the visuals and gameplay changes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Adventure Log Part 1 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtcnET6lQwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too. Absolutely one to watch for classic JRPG fans.</p>

<h3>Nioh 3</h3>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 6th February 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> was revealed back in June which came with a timed PS5 demo. The third entry to the series refreshes things again with a new protagonist and updated combat. The main character for Nioh 3 is Tokugawa Takechiyo, the now former Shogun who was forced from the top of the Shogunate by his brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu. Tokugawa Kunimatsu hasn’t wasted time by transforming the country into a Yokai infested hellscape either.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Nioh 3 has two major changes compared to the previous games. First is the more open world structure, referred to as Open Field by Koei Tecmo, and the second is the Ninja combat stance that can be used alongside the Samurai stance. Where Samurai is all about is about facing off against enemies using high, medium, and low stances to attack and counter, Ninja is about a more hit and run approach to strike quickly and efficiently. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be a great third entry and we don’t have long to wait for its release.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Catch our hands on preview of Nioh 3 here</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 12th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Of the many branches of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, some of the most popular games are the Kiwami remakes. With the series’ origins on PS2, Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 were great efforts to spruce up the acclaimed originals and bring them to a much broader global audience at the same time. Now, having branched off in various new directions, they’re tackling the first game to release on PS3 with Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Demo Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtv7LzYLwc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But wait, there’s more to this than before, and in addition to remaking a chapter in Kazuma’s life (and expanding it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-adds-a-new-bad-boy-dragon-mode/">a Bad Boy Dragon mode</a>), there’s a new Dark Ties side story, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell.</p>
<p>Need this in your life sooner than later? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/a-yakuza-kiwami-3-demo-is-rolling-out-today/">Grab the Yakuza Kiwami 3 demo</a>, which is live now on all platforms!</p>
<h3>Styx: Blades of Greed</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The grubby, sneaky little goblin is back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> this year with a new obsession driving him forward. He seeks the power of the Quartz to give him a bunch of new abilities, and to strike back at the humans and elves that would oppress him and his kind. That makes him sound like an altruist, but he’s always just been out for himself, really.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>
<h3>Tides of Tomorrow</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tides of Tomorrow - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVjNGNZcqHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 27th February 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s time for another fresh reinvention of the Resident Evil franchise, kicking off a new story arc, introducing new characters, and shifting the tone of the horror once more. Our new leading lady, Grace Ashcroft might be an FBI agent, but she’s woefully unprepared to face the horrors awaiting her in the Renwood Hotel, the same hotel in which her mother was murdered, dragging her back to Resident Evil’s original stomping ground of Raccoon City.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But there’s another side to Requiem, as Leon will also return to the game, his story intertwined with Grace’s, letting her handle all the tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action.</p>
<p>We went hands on with Resident Evil Requiem last summer, delving into its creepy horror-filled delights. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">See our preview here.</a></p>
<h3>Marathon</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot has already been through the wringer of public opinion, with the public tests last year forcing the studio to delay their planned launch and rework significant parts of the experience. But where many once questioned if an extraction shooter could hit the mainstream, the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> last year has buoyed interest and optimism for Bungie’s take on the genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pre-Order Trailer | Marathon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Key changes since last year include the introduction of proximity voice chat, a new solo runner queue and solo scavenger character type, and upgrades to the visual fidelity across the board. Leaning further into the scavenging gameplay, opening up the avenues for greater ad hoc player collaboration, and extending the game’s distinctive art direction should make this pretty attractive. Once to keep an eye on!</p>
<h3>Toxic Commando</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 12th March 2026</em></p>
<p>John Carpenter loves himself some zombies, and while a little unexpected, it is pretty neat to have the 70s and 80s action film icon and master of the held note synth soundtrack attach his name to a new co-op zombie shooter. Not only that, but it’s partnering with Saber Interactive, who know a thing or two about making giant hordes of enemies for you to shoot down!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Release Date Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/svWU-rezMu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/25/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-preview-world-war-z-with-a-side-of-roadcraft/">our hands on time with Toxic Commando last year</a>, there’s a wild hodgepodge of Saber’s previous games and ideas being brought together for this game. Yes, you have the big WWZ-style zombie hordes and defensive set pieces, but they’re now taking place in open world sandbox zones, and there’s some MudRunner and RoadCraft style vehicle mechanics at play too. A curious one, but once you add co-op to the mix, there’s always fun to be had.</p>
<h3>Crimson Desert</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with a huge open world to explore and a plethora of bosses to battle against. You’ll step into the role of Kliff, a member of the Greymanes, who has been ambushed and fails to fight back against the Black Bears. Managing to survive, there’s a sweeping adventure ahead, spanning the continent of Pywel.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">I got to play the game last summer</a>, sampling a few of the boss battles, saying “We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.”</p>
<h3>Pragmata</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 24th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally thought to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> is a new sci-fi action adventure from the Monster Hunter and Street Fighter publisher. You play as Hugh and Diana, an astronaut and his android companion looking to uncover the mysteries of a lunar research station that has been overrun by hostile artificial intelligence. The protagonists have a symbiotic relationship that weaves its way into Pragmata’s combat, navigation, and puzzle-solving gameplay with Hugh doing the heavy lifting as Diana employs her hacking abilities right in the middle of battle.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To explain what that’s all about, we went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> last year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy.”</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/pragmata-release-date-confirmed-and-its-coming-to-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo/">a demo currently available on PC</a>, which will hopefully make its way to consoles ahead of its launch this Spring.</p>
<h3>Saros</h3>
<p><em>PS5 – 20th April 2026</em></p>
<p>When something works why change the formula too much? That seems to be Housemarque’s thinking behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal’s</a> successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>. A time loop roguelike third person shooter where progress is made by repeating runs and pushing forward each time as you learn more about the world. While the gameplay is similar the story and characters are all new.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saros follows the story of Arjun Devraj, played by Rahul Kohli, a team leader of the Soltari Enforcers who have been sent to this planet. The planet is already hostile enough but the dying sun and time loop issue is stretching patience between the team. The story here will appear to focus on the stress of the time loop on Arjun and the rest of his team.</p>
<h3>007: First Light</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 27th May 2026</em></p>
<p>While we still wait on the news on who will be the next James Bond for the films, we don’t have to wait much longer for IO Interactive’s take on the most famous of spies, even if the game has been delayed to May. 007: First Light is IO Interactive’s most ambitious games, taking on the mantle of crafting a new Bond story while using lessons learned from its highly acclaimed Hitman games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="007 First Light: Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTUoIyTMw0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bond is not yet the globe trotting super spy we all know, but a young agent still earning his reputation and having to work as part of a team. The mission is to take down 009 who has gone rogue, using MI6’s own tactics against them. Bond is a loose cannon who will do things his own way to get the job done, even if it doesn’t please others in the organisation. The game will feature spycraft, shootouts, and driving ( a first for IO Interactive) with each taking inspiration from the 007 books and movies.</p>
<h3>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 29th May 2026</em></p>
<p>Arkham is likely to be a significant part of our next game on the list too, but any horrors here won’t scare our protagonist so easily. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is going to be the biggest LEGO Batman game both in scope and depth. This is a celebration of all things Batman from the very beginning to his most modern iterations, with a Gotham City that moves with the times and is open to exploration however you see fit.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gets-a-new-trailer-stuffed-with-villains-and-heroes/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> draws from a history of Batman comics, shows, and movies to celebrate Batman, the Bat-family, and the villains that have all become iconic characters in their own right. The game itself will move through different generations, with key moments from the different eras providing a foundation for the game’s story. The story is not going to be the sole focus, with the open world Gotham City providing plenty of opportunities for Batman to stop criminals.</p>
<h3>Grand Theft Auto VI</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S – 19th November 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> is inevitably going to be the biggest game of whatever year it eventually releases in. Once upon a time we expected it to arrive in 2025, but two delays through last year now have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the release date penned in for this November</a>. Will Rockstar manage to hit this latest target? You have to hope so!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime opera, and from what little we’ve seen of the game so far, it looks like they’re fully embracing all the wild excess and craziness that you’d expect from a fictionalised rendition of Miami and the Florida Keys. It looks like this will be a bit of a modern-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde style story with its two protagonists. Lucia Caminos is the series’ first female lead, who’s coming fresh out of a stint in prison, while Jason Duval is working for the local drug gangs. The pair are thrust together after a failed bank robbery, and are then swept up in a grand conspiracy.</p>
<div>
<p>Of course, then there’s whatever GTA Online morphs into for this game…</p>

<h2>Release Date To Be Announced</h2>
<h3>Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>
<p><em>PS5 – Second half of 2026</em></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-1-marvels-wolverine/">most wanted game of 2026</a> is all about a grizzled old Canadian who just wants to be left alone. Insomniac Games are branching away from the mouthy web-slinging of Spider-Man and embracing the slicing and dicing of Adamantium claws that Wolverine offers.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It wouldn’t make sense to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed, but while we’ve yet to see a full combat demo, it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see more!</p>
<h3>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h3>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>
<h3>Control Resonant</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Remedy Entertainment might have stumbled last year with their Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, but their full sequel to the 2019 hit looks like it will get them right back on track. Control Resonant brings us much more of a melee focus to the combat, while embracing and furthering the trippy, twisted environments that you’ll be fighting supernatural forces in.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="CONTROL Resonant – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having previously been contained within The Oldest House, malevolent forces have now spread out into Manhattan, reshaping the world and breaking down the laws of physics and reality as it goes. With Jesse having gone missing, it’s up to her brother Dylan to step up, awaken new powers within himself, and fight back.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Zero Company</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Do you want a Star Wars-themed XCOM? Because that’s what Star Wars Zero Company promises to be. Coming from XCOM veterans at their new studio Bit Reactor, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi Padawan, pulled together by former Republic officer Hawks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will be celebrating its eighth anniversary later this year. It’s also hard to imagine that 2026 will see yet another reincarnation of gaming’s favourite gunslinging archaeologist, first appearing in a remake of Lara Croft’s original adventure.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-reimagines-laras-original-adventure/">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a> will offer a complete modernisation of the first game, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and starring new lead actress, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also take lead in next year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>.</p>
<h3>Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In October, the once unthinkable finally happened. Microsoft’s flagship <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo franchise was confirmed to be coming to PlayStation for the first time</a>. What had long been a key part of Microsoft’s strategy to draw players to its hardware over PlayStation, is now going multiplatform with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a full on remake of the original Halo campaign with new gameplay tweaks and content. As the name suggests it will not feature any competitive PvP multiplayer, but Halo: Campaign Evolved will have two player local co-op and four player online co-op. It will also feature three new prequel missions, new enemies, more weapons including the Halo 2’s Battle Rifle, and more vehicles.</p>
<h3>Directive 8020</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>Where Supermassive spun out the first series of The Dark Pictures anthology games in rapid succession, the wait for the new generation of the studio’s horror games is extending into 2026. Yet we’re still very keen to see how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> comes together.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Directive 8020 | Gamescom 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmqh6m7vSBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in Supermassive’s series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship. The game is really pushing Supermassive’s breed of horror into action game territory, the sci-fi setting, the tight third person control and needing to stealthily sneak and evade the alien monster that’s hunting you.</p>
<h3>Warhammer 40,000 Boltgun 2</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was heralded as a great return to form for the boomer shooter form, getting critical acclaim and commercial success. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has already got high expectations placed upon its shoulders, and what we know of it so far seems to promise a lot more action without sacrificing much of what made Boltgun great.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Character Reveal Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43jjsBVarPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 gives us two protagonists to play as, Sternguard Veteran Malum Caedo and Sister of Battle, Nyra Veyrath. Each has their own playstyle so you can try new ways of taking on enemies as you travel through a hive city and mangrove swamps. The story will also have a branching narrative with each choice taking you to different levels, meaning you may have to play through a few times to see everything. On top of that there are new enemy units to engage in combat with including Bloodletters ,Juggernauts and other new enemies from different factions. Boltgun 2 is going to be a bigger and louder experience than its predecessor, but we will have to wait and see if it is better.</p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>More than half a decade since its announcement, Playground Games’ Fable reboot / sequel is finally set to launch in 2026, and it looks incredible. You start your adventure as a child growing up in Briar Hill, when your heroic powers start to emerge just as the townspeople are all turned to stone. From there, you venture forth into the open world of Albion and can adventure to solve the dangers that threaten this fantasy world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Gameplay Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4zJJSEm1ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what has always made Fable special is the freedom to do what you want between adventuring. Playground Games has made 1,000 people to inhabit this world, all of whom are fully voices, and all of whom can and will have opinions on you. What you do will affect how they react to you, and when you can be a bigamist with a bunch of spouses and dozens of children, or buy up all the property in the world and become a benevolent or cruel landlord, those opinions are going to change pretty dramatically. Morality is here, but it’s more subjective and personal than ever before.</p>
<h3>Forza Horizon 6</h3>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 19th May | PS5 – Late 2026</em></p>
<p>The excellent open world arcade racing of Forza Horizon is heading to Japan – easily the most requested destination for any long-running open world game series. Forza Horizon 6 promises the biggest map to race around yet, both in terms of the footprint of the world, and in terms of what it contains. There’s a sprawling rendition of Tokyo here with multiple districts, each of which has its own particular look and style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s another rags to driving riches journey here, as you race your way to the top of the Horizon Festival, but after Horizon 4 and 5, Playground has sought to rejig the progression you’ll see, the balance of the vehicles, improve their handling, and much more. We’re really keen to see what this next step means for the series.</p>
<h3>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA 2026</em></p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the release of the last mainline Onimusha game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is going to bring that long absence to an end. While games have changed in 20 years, it looks like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will retain its identity as a third person action game where you face off against demons in Japan. You will be able to cut through enemies using your sword and absorb different orbs that can replenish your health, your energy attack, and give you experience. A new black orb will provide pivotal story points.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword Preview – Slicing through this samurai revival" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto during the Edo period where peace is shattered as the demonic Genma launch an attack. The only one who can fight this infestation is Miyamoto Musashi due to being bonded to an Oni Gauntlet. If you are worried about having to catch up with Onimusha lore, don’t be. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is essentially a fresh start for the series, which ties into the story it’s shaping up to tell.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Catch our hands on preview of Onimusha: Way of the Sword here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Phew! That’s a lot of big games! Keep your eyes glued to TheSixthAxis for reviews of this lot as they drop, and news, previews and more details as they emerge through the year.</em></p>
