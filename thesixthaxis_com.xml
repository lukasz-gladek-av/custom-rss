		<p>Crash-tastic racer sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>&nbsp;is barrelling its way to a PC Early Access release on 20th March 2025, Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On day one, the early access version of Wreckfest 2 will have the core game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer, and this will provide a great testbed for the game’s fundamental gameplay, with all the racing for up to 24 drivers, the overhauled physics and renewed visuals.</p>
<p>Bugbear will feed in more content over time, including the revamped career mode that will adapt to individual playstyles. Online racing will have a new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues, though it’s not clear if they will be there on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/car-smashing-sequel-wreckfest-2-has-been-announced/">Announced last summer</a>, Bugbear previewed their&nbsp;new ROMU engine for demolition physics and dynamic simulation, which looks to take the smash-happy racing to new levels. There’s also a brand new sound system, which they believe to be one of the very best and more accurate in a racing game.</p>

<p>Another big new feature is the car customiser, which allows you to change colours per body part, add layered decals, but then also go deeper into making your car look like a bit of a wreck by painting on rust and body damage. I’m sure there’s going to be some great car liveries made in Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, Wreckfest 2 is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Wreckfest was a smash hit when it first launched back in 2018, though we reviewed it for the original console launch, with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/29/wreckfest-review/">9/10 Wreckfest review</a>. We said, “Wreckfest is a surprising triumph in blending the best that sim and arcade racers have to offer in an explosive and visually gratifying package. A few visual issues and overly aggressive AI do little to spoil one of the best driving games of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bugbear gave the game years of support after that, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/wreckfest-native-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-version-how-to-upgrade/">a big upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> that brought 60FPS racing to consoles. I’m sure we can expect similar plans for Wreckfest 2.</p>
