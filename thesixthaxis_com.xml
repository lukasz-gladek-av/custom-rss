		<p>Sumo Digital is stepping away from creating its own IP, making <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">a public statement</a> that it is now going to focus “exclusively on development services for partners.”</p>
<p>The statement justifies this by saying that they need to balance “creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business”. The goal is to become “a premium development partner”, something which is very much in keeping with a good portion of the company’s work to date.</p>


<p>At this time it’s not clear the extent of any associated job losses, though they state that “Unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people. We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care, and compassion.”</p>
<p>Sumo Digital has traditionally been known for their work on other publisher IPs, their most notable games including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/12/19/hands-on-sonic-sega-all-stars-racing/">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/18/littlebigplanet-3-review/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and pulling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/crackdown-3-review/">Crackdown 3</a> out of development hell, but starting with 2017’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/30/snake-pass-review/">Snake Pass</a>, they also sought to produce their own IP and branch out from work-for-hire and co-development contracts – even if these provided plenty of work, such as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/21/hitman-2-review/">Hitman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review/">Forza Horizon 4 &amp; 5</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won’t see the company winding down its Secret Mode publishing label, which has generally been the home for the company’s own IP productions, including last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/stampede-racing-royale-launches-for-free-with-a-dave-the-diver-collab/">Stampede: Racing Royale</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/deathsprint-66-is-a-buzzsaw-of-dystopian-future-racing/">DeathSprint ’66</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a> from subsidiary The Chinese Room. They’ve also been a broader indie publisher, though, with cute underwater adventure Loddlenaut, bike delivery game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>, and neat-and-tidy-’em-up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/11/a-little-to-the-left-review/">A Little to the Left</a>.</p>

<p>Sumo Digital was founded in 2003 in Sheffield, spending six years as a subsidiary to Foundation 9 Entertainment before regaining independence through a management buyout in 2014, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/">being acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The company has grown a huge amount in the last decade, and Sumo Group has grown to around 1,400 employees by 2023, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore. They’ve also further studios including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/14/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-devs-the-chinese-room-have-joined-sumo/">The Chinese Room</a>, Red Kit Games, Lab42, Atomhawk and more.</p>
<p>There’s uncertain times ahead, and hopefully the layoffs and disruption for such a large company – both in the UK and abroad – will be minimal.</p>

		<p>Following the mixed reception to its launch last week, a second hotfix update is now available for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> on PC, as Nixxes look to address the main pain points that users have felt with the port.</p>
<p>In particular they’ve sought to stamp out crashes and stability issues as much as possible – though they also hazard that you really, really should update your drivers to the very latest version to have Spider-Man 2 compatibility built in.</p>


<p>Beyond that, they’ve fixed an Achievements bug that was causing them to fail – this will work retroactively upon loading a save file – and fixed a DualShock 4 button prompt bug.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Spider-Man 2 PC v1.202.0.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Achievements not being awarded on some configurations.</li>
<li>Triangle and Square button prompts are now displayed correctly when using a DualShock 4 controller with Steam Input enabled.</li>
<li>Resolved a frame rate related bug that could block players during the mission ‘Show Me New York’.</li>
</ul>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve been playing with our PCs and generally found that the game has been fine following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/500563872868991406">the first hotfix last Friday</a>, both in terms of stability and performance. Hopefully the game quickly gets up to snuff for those that are running into problems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/wreckfest-2-hurtles-toward-pc-early-access-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Crash-tastic racer sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>&nbsp;is barrelling its way to a PC Early Access release on 20th March 2025, Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On day one, the early access version of Wreckfest 2 will have the core game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer, and this will provide a great testbed for the game’s fundamental gameplay, with all the racing for up to 24 drivers, the overhauled physics and renewed visuals.</p>
<p>Bugbear will feed in more content over time, including the revamped career mode that will adapt to individual playstyles. Online racing will have a new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues, though it’s not clear if they will be there on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/car-smashing-sequel-wreckfest-2-has-been-announced/">Announced last summer</a>, Bugbear previewed their&nbsp;new ROMU engine for demolition physics and dynamic simulation, which looks to take the smash-happy racing to new levels. There’s also a brand new sound system, which they believe to be one of the very best and more accurate in a racing game.</p>

<p>Another big new feature is the car customiser, which allows you to change colours per body part, add layered decals, but then also go deeper into making your car look like a bit of a wreck by painting on rust and body damage. I’m sure there’s going to be some great car liveries made in Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, Wreckfest 2 is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Wreckfest was a smash hit when it first launched back in 2018, though we reviewed it for the original console launch, with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/29/wreckfest-review/">9/10 Wreckfest review</a>. We said, “Wreckfest is a surprising triumph in blending the best that sim and arcade racers have to offer in an explosive and visually gratifying package. A few visual issues and overly aggressive AI do little to spoil one of the best driving games of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bugbear gave the game years of support after that, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/wreckfest-native-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-version-how-to-upgrade/">a big upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> that brought 60FPS racing to consoles. I’m sure we can expect similar plans for Wreckfest 2.</p>
