		<p>Matt Ryan, the voice actor for Edward Kenway in Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, was recently filmed while signing merch at a convention. While he is busy signing his name, he looks up at the camera and asks, “Have you beat the game?” to which the person behind the camera replies, “I have, a while ago.”</p>
<p>“You may have to beat again,” says Matt, and then looks up with a very cheeky grin on his face.</p>


<p>Ubisoft confirmed remakes of Assassin’s Creed games were being considered but so far none have arrived. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is widely regarded as one of the best Assassin’s Creed games and rumours of a remake have been floating around in the ether for a good few years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1st</a> recently reported that the remake would be running on the Anvil engine and “will feature new systems, with combat and ecosystems around wildlife specifically mentioned.” It has been suggested the remake would be out sometime this year, possibly in time for the big Christmas market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-hinted/">Insider Gaming</a> spotted that artists at Pure Arts, a company that makes statues based on video game characters, seemed to announce the game before anyone else. “Assassin’s Creed fans out there, you should be aware that there is something going on with Edward [Keyway]”, said one host who was then interrupted by the other host who seems to panic and says“Wait has that been announced?”</p>

<p>“I think so, I’m pretty sure I saw rumours about it. No, I definitely saw at article about it”, he continued, “So there’s going to be something going on with Edward, and our PVC 1/8th scale statue will reflect that accordingly”.</p>
<p>We gave the original release<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/10/30/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review/"> 9/10 back in 2013</a></p>
<p>“Black Flag is more than just a return to form for Assassin’s Creed, it is an overall improvement and probably the best game in the series yet,” said Gareth. “It has taken the gameplay of the previous games, refined it, and combined it with a huge open world that is packed with enough content to literally last for days. If you have ever wanted a proper pirate game, this is as good as it gets.”</p>
