		<p>Marking the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld’s</a> early access release, developer Pocketpair has released a roadmap of what to expect in future updates through 2025. Most exciting are major new features including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals, and a World Tree ending scenario</p>
<p>It’s less of a roadmap, and more of a to-do list, to be honest, as there’s no timeline to go with the list of features and content that Pocketpair has outlines. We’ve no idea when to expect crossplay, for example. Still, it’s great to see the team targeting some rather key features for the game.</p>


<p>The future Palworld roadmap includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-op Crossplay</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria)</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization</li>
<li>Improvements to UX</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the game roadmap, Pocketpair has also marked the first anniversary by putting the game’s soundtrack on YouTube with 28 tracks included.</p>

<p>Palworld is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/palworld-is-out-today-on-ps5/">since last September</a>, across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. December saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">a major new update for the game that added a whole new island region</a> for players to explore.</p>
<p>Palworld has enjoyed a huge amount of success, its meme-worthy blend of Pokémon-like monsters, base building, crafting and guns proving to be an immediate hit last January.&nbsp;That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

			<p>The sci-fi future of Freedom Wars Remastered makes George Orwell’s 1984 look like a holiday brochure. Forget worrying about the government tracking you, or whether what you read is the truth, in Freedom Wars you’re born with a 1,000,000 year prison sentence. One. Million. Years. From birth. This dystopian vision of the future is so ruthless, you have to earn the right to lie down. What happens if you forget? That’s a crime, and you’ll find another batch of years being added to your sentence.</p>
<p>This brutality paves the way for Sinners like you to work in indentured servitude to your Panopticon – a prison city – earning your right to essential things like lying down, or frivolities like running for more than five seconds. Each contribution to the greater good knocks a few years off your sentence, hopefully moving things in the right direction. Unless, of course, you callously go for a little run. Then it’s going back up again.</p>
<p><iframe title="FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmbyQrgqFeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/10/freedom-wars-review/">Freedom Wars</a> was originally a PS Vita exclusive, and it’s remained one of the most talked about and sought-after titles in the handheld’s catalogue. Arriving here in Remastered form, there are minimal quality of life changes, but the key thing is that the game is here to experience across a raft of modern platforms. That’s well worth celebrating, but it’s a shame that the team at Dimps didn’t take the chance to bring us a more modern interpretation of the game’s iconic gameplay to go alongside it.</p>
<p>Freedom Wars belongs to the Monster Hunter branch of the action-RPG genre’s family tree, its combat centring on taking down huge foes called Abductors with a team of other players – either real-life allies or AI controlled. You follow that up by collecting various parts and components from that fallen foe, and using them to upgrade and improve your weaponry, or turning them in to your Panopticon in a bid to bring that sentence further down.</p>


<p>In 2024, Freedom Wars Remastered is showing its age and its portable origins. While the technical improvements bring the game up to a 4K resolution and 60fps refresh rate, they don’t do anything for the clunky gameplay, and it feels incredibly stilted when you compare it to modern genre entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/wild-hearts-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x/">Wild Hearts</a>, paling before the imminent arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> next month.</p>
<p>While the use of your Thorn – a binding device that lets you pull enemies to their knees or climb up them to attack – still feels fun, it’s not as fluid as you’d want it to be, and though you can swap between two weapons on the fly – an idea that Monster Hunter is only just cribbing from – there are various annoying limitations like the questionable hit detection that wear on you the longer you spend with the game.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that Freedom Wars isn’t enjoyable. The far-flung future setting is one of Freedom Wars greatest strengths, and I love the overarching ideas and themes that push you to improve your character’s loadout, and their position within the Panopticon. The gameplay remains as solid as it was at release, and if you’re looking for a timesink while you wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, there are flashes of greatness through the game’s runtime that make it worth picking up.</p>
<p>It is a case of missed opportunity, though. The PC port has launched in an awful state, and while the first patches have improved things considerably, I wouldn’t expect to be experiencing any level of frame skipping in a basic remaster of a ten-year-old game. On top of that, the different graphical options are extremely limited, and you can’t make any changes to the frame rate whatsoever – surely this is a game that could run at 120Hz without breaking a sweat?</p>

<p>There is one addition that the remastering team have added, but it’s not necessarily an improvement. The original Japanese release of the game used text to speech for some of its AI-driven characters, as it made sense thematically, and was an impressive inclusion in a handheld title at the time. They’ve added that to the English dub this time around as well, and it’s fair to say that its decade-old synthesised speech will be an acquired taste for many. Various words are mispronounced in every single conversation with your Accessory or the Panopticon’s AI, and confusingly, you can’t even escape it by setting the voices to Japanese as these characters speak in English regardless.</p>

		<p>The setting of a solar system war is a familiar setting, that’s been explored in various stories. Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog is a visual novel set in a universe where such a war has concluded. The allied front of the Martian Territories and the Jovian Unified Colony Fleet has defeated the oppressive Earth-based Solar Federation. Your character is a Jovian, meant to take part in a battle during the final days of the war, but your mech had engineering issues. Those issues lead to almost all of your squadron getting killed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog - Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4D9LXfAyAVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog opens aboard the Jovian Carrier JFS Kalyke. Your character, who you can name, is a fresh conscript who is trained as a pilot, but training has all been done in simulations and not in real-world situations. In this opening, your frame, aka mech, does not disengage from the Kalyke, leading to the aforementioned squadron wipe out. The game moves on from this opening to four years after the war, where your character is made a lieutenant following years of doing security detail, and is transferred to the JFS Gun Dog, a very small ship with a small crew.</p>


<p>Before you meet the crew you familiarise yourself with the gameplay screen, which has five options on the right hand side. Those options are move, use, look, talk and item. Look lets you observe surroundings and gain information about locations, use is for interacting with things in the rooms, item lets you see and use the items you are carrying. The talk button brings up who is available to talk and interact with. Later on, a function button is made available that gives access to your task list, a map of the ship allowing fast travel, and an info tab which gives background about items and the game’s lore. What I found a great design choice here was that when you clicked on a button there was a hefty clunk sound, providing satisfying feedback and playing into the retro design feel of Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog.</p>
<p>Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog looks green throughout, with the graphics fundamentally being different tones of that shade. It evokes the sense of playing on a retro handhold, and it mostly looks great. The function screen could be a bit better since the words on the options are blurred. Understandably, it is done to maintain that retro feel, but a modern touch here wouldn’t take away from the overall impact of the game’s look. Music is very good and maintains a retro feel that the game is going for. It has that sci-fi feel to it, while also feeding into that classic old-school gaming setup, while the music matches each scene I played through very well.</p>


<p>The crew of the Gun Dog include Cassandra, love interest of the main character who has also been assigned to the same ship after some playing around with admin. She is described as someone who jokes around a lot, and this is the reason why she doesn’t have her own ship command, though she is high-ranking in the hierarchy. Captain Bartermews, captain of the Gun Dog, appears to be quite laid back and you later find she has a bit of a drinking problem. Mackenzie Cathays, &nbsp;is the Chief Engineer and will go into lectures and tangents about various engineering theories and terms.</p>
<p>Dylan is the gunner, who spends much of his time in the gunner room, listening to albums. Seifer Rosarium is the ship doctor who doesn’t care much for patient confidentiality, while Cadet Dalton Grange is the junior engineer based in the hangar. There’s also Haru Rumney, pilot, and Hansen Crwys, only other survivor of the Kalyke squadron that was killed and former squadmate of your player character, who blames your character for that failed mission. The relationships and how they evolve will depend on your actions and decisions. Throughout Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog, you will face various decisions and choices, from how you deal with interpersonal conflict to bigger choices that will impact the whole crew.</p>
<p>The story of the game is really promising from the initial demo, and if you want to check it out it is available at the following links:</p>
