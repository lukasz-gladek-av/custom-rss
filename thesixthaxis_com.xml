		<p>I think I’m just about back to normal after staying up far too late for The Game Awards and then not being able to catch up on sleep the day after. How was that for you, though? Did any big game announcements catch your eye?</p>
<p>We’ll be kicking off our own Game of the Year awards in the coming week (and we promise not to force you to sit through advertorials, music numbers and have 100% less Geoff presenting things).</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
