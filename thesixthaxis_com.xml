		<p>Milestone has released a gameplay mechanic video for its upcoming anime styled arcade racer Screamer, detailing the Sync and Entropy parts of the Echo system. Both Sync and Entropy have advantages for racers in Screamer dealing with offence and defence as battles play out across the tracks to gain advantages.</p>
<p><iframe title="Screamer - Gameplay Mechanics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVFRBbp1RMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sync is gained passively but it can be topped up by pulling off an active shift. Sync is used to generate shields to defend against incoming attacks, or boost to gain some extra speed. Sync in turn generates Entropy, and that is what you use to go on the offence. Entropy allows attacks like Strike and Overdrive. Strike is an attack that can make other racers explode, while Overdrive is a highly powered attack that boosts speed, grants temporary shielding, and lets you knock out opponents, but there’s a catch. If you crash into a wall while in Overdrive your car will explode, so picking the right time to use it will be vital. On top of these abilities, each character will have their own abilities to use too.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
