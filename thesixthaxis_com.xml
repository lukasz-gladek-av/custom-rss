		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the grimdark sci-fi successor to Fatshark’s popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/25/vermintide-2-review-worth-playing-2022-warhammer-games/">Vermintide</a> series, is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> on 3rd December, the studio has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darktide on PS5 will have all of the content and improvements made to the game since the PC launch, and on top of that comes with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced</a> marker. That means you’ll see the following performance targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame rate of 60 FPS on a 4K resolution for PlayStation 5 Pro</li>
<li>Performance mode (60FPS on a 1440p resolution) for PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Quality Mode (30FPS on a 4K resolution) for PlayStation 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PS5 version will likely be a pretty close match to the game on Xbox Series X, but there’s naturally that further step available for the game when playing on PS5 Pro that matches Sony’s vision for the best of both worlds between Quality and Performance modes.</p>
<p>Darktide first launched for PC in November 2022, but was met with no small amount of negativity from the Vermintide community over performance, bugs and the game progression in general. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/warhammer-40k-darktide-xbox-release-delayed-as-developer-focusses-on-improvements/">Fatshark postponed the Xbox Series X|S release in order to address those problems</a>, eventually launching the game on console in October 2023. Now, whether there was an exclusivity contract or not, the game is coming to PS5.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide sees you joining a team of Inquisitorial Operatives, embarking on a series of missions, attempting to free a city from the clutches of the corrupted forces of Chaos. The twist is that, where you might expect to be a loyal member of the Space Marines in most 40K games, you’re actually a criminal given a chance at redemption after saving the life of an Imperial Guard officer from Chaos worshippers. That means that you won’t have all the best weapons and gear that you’d see in something like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, so there’s still a fair bit of melee combat alongside the gunplay.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed the game, with Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">our review</a>, “Darktide is an absolute blast. Its heavyweight blend of melee and gunplay ensure that the flow of frantic runs into the hive city just keep on coming.”</p>
