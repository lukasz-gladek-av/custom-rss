		<p>Traveler’s Tales has shared another look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, showing off Batman and his rogue’s gallery in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Heroes &amp; Villains Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xciD-Vz6T_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is set to be the biggest Lego Batman game by far, both in how it’s going open world with its Lego antics, and in taking inspiration from across the full history of Batman, across movies, TV shows, and the comics. This trailer showed little snippets of gameplay interspersed with characters like Catwoman (who can summon a cat to scratch people up), Robin, and iconic villains Two Face, Penguin and Joker</p>
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on 29th May 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC</p>

		<p>Nagoshi Studio has revealed Gang of Dragon, and it certainly looks like Toshihiro Nagoshi, the former general director of Ryu Ga Gotoko Studio, is looking to outdo his former team!</p>
<p><iframe title="Gang of Dragon Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAuTGHQmimk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s certainly a very good looking game with exceptional character animation, lighting and performance capture as the protagonist is confronted in a bar.</p>
<p>What follows is snippets of car driving, sword fighting, hand-to-hand martial arts and more.</p>
<p>Nagoshi left Sega and RGG back in 2021 alongside several other former Sega employees to found Nagoshi Studio as a subsidiary of NetEase.</p>

		<p>Control Resonant has just been announced at the Game Awards with a man hanging from the ceiling and then being shoved in a big glass box, closely followed by a pigeon exploding. Yep. we’re back in the world of Control and it looks like things have escaped from the Oldest House.</p>
<p>You will be playing as a Dylan Faden who appeared in the first game as the character P6, and he also in Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1_eZyFM5-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Explore a warped Manhattan on the brink of paranatural annihilation in this thrilling action-adventure RPG. Unleash the extraordinary powers of Dylan Faden as he fights for his humanity and survival against a reality-bending cosmic threat.”</em></p>
<p>Control Resonant was originally announced back in November 2022 when Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> an agreement to co-develop and co-publish the new game. At that point Control 2, as it was known, was still in the initial pre-production concept stage, with an initial budget of €50 million.</p>

<p>Things changed in 2024 when Remedy Entertainment has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> franchise as a whole from 505 Games, including both the already-released 2019 game, and any future projects.&nbsp; Remedy asked for this freedom in order to give themselves a fresh chance to either self-publish the games or find a new publishing partner for these two games.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they did a few months later when Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> a strategic partnership which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>Control Resonant will launch in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

		<p>Capcom has shared a fresh trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at The Game Awards revealing more of the story and the character Doctor Victor Gideon. We also get confirmation – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/playstation-store-leaks-that-leon-kennedy-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem/">not that we needed it</a> – that Leon will be in the game and he’s a playable character.</p>
<p>The story will intertwine the stories of Leon and Grace, with Grace’s section being tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil 9 Requiem Leon Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0oAeG3Ly0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy. Without the series stalwarts at its heart, we’re getting back to much more horror than action of some entries.</p>
<p>As was eventually the case for Resident Evil Village, Requiem will feature both first person and third person gameplay from the off, looking to make the most of the RE Engine’s latest iteration. I found that really changed the tone of the action when going hands on earlier this year.</p>

<p>I said in our preview, “Resident Evil Requiem promises another new beginning for the iconic horror franchise, but it’s still one that’s deeply tied to the series’ past. There’s plenty of tropes here, plenty of references back to the original games, and gameplay ideas that will be familiar, but from my brief hands on with the game, there’s still so, so much to be excited about.”</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of announcing their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/sony-bad-robot-games-the-designer-of-left-4-dead-are-making-a-new-co-op-shooter/">partnership with Sony</a>, Bad Robot Games and their CCO Mike Booth (of Left 4 Dead creating fame) have announced 4:Loop.</p>
<p><iframe title="4:LOOP - The Game Awards 2025 Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-5ieEtmgTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a world where Earth has been effectively frozen in place by some kind of alien invasion, 4:Loop is a tactical four-player co-op shooter that will send your team out there to try and defeat the bad monsters time and time again. You’ll lose, you’ll learn, you’ll try again with different character builds, and all the rest.</p>
<p>It’s not been said in quite so many words, but this seems to be a run-based roguelite style of game, and there’s certainly some shades of Returnal.</p>
<p>In development for PS5 and PC, you can sign up to <a href="https://play4loop.badrobotgames.com/signup/playtester">take part in playtests here</a>.</p>
