			<p>The French Revolution is an ideal period of history to set a video game. Warring factions, apocalyptic-like societal collapse, buckets of gore, surely everything a good video game story needs. Sadly, Liberté entirely fails to capitalise on the juicy era in which it is set. Indeed, it succeeds accidentally in only one aspect, just like the French Revolution, Liberté is an absolute mess.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberte - PlayStation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXli7PqJeC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ostensibly a top-down isometric hack n’ slash action RPG, Liberté is best described as an experience to be avoided. Visually the game is lumbered with the blocky, charmless visuals of a bad PS2 game. Despite the rudimentary graphics however, Liberté made my PS5 sweat like a member of the aristocracy paying a visit to Madame Guillotine. Frequent painful frame drops, several second freezes, and ominous black loading screens plague the far too long run time. Characters regularly drop in and out of existence, as if they are teleporting, only they shouldn’t be. At points, Liberté isn’t far off being unplayable.</p>


<p>Combat is basic and tedious, with no sense of impact from attacks. Player character Rene goes up against the same obviously cloned French Soldiers again and again. A dash and a combo or two are your lot, but frankly, so easy is the game that these skills are likely all you’ll need to storm through each tiny mostly linear level. Like a peasant rampaging through the Bastille, the game offers no resistance. Oh, other than by crashing and wiping out all your progress of course.</p>


<p>Liberté has one good idea, and even that it bungles. Rene is awarded abilities by acquiring cards from a deck. To activate the abilities, the player must elect to destroy a number of the cards in order to equip a favoured power-up. It could be a neat risk and reward mechanic, requiring the player to carefully consider the combat situation they are facing and respond accordingly. Problem is, your initial combo is so effective you don’t even need to use your abilities. Worse still, these powers, despite sounding cool – wielding a guitar as a weapon, lobbing a multitude of axes – visually they are limp and indistinct, offering no thrill in their use at all.</p>
<p>The story is nonsensical, the dialogue resolutely boresome, the characters flat and vapid, and the whole experience feels like little has changed since the game was in early access two years ago.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Avoid Liberté like a one-way ticket to the Guillotine. Instead, if you want to experience the French Revolution, read a book instead. It will be more interactive, the loading times will be much improved, and the graphics will probably be better too.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evercade-unveils-its-latest-cartridge-release-%E2%80%93-indie-heroes-collection-4.1080186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/evercade-unveils-its-latest-cartridge-release-indie-heroes-collection-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Evercade family went from strength to strength in 2024, between the arrival of new hardware in the shape of the revised EXP-R, the tabletop Evercade Alpha, and the Gameboy-styled HyperMegaTech Super Pockets, as well as the steady stream of new cartridges to play on your system of choice. That only looks to continue in 2025, and while they’re teasing us with new announcements just around the corner, the first of this year’s software releases is Indie Heroes Collection 4, a lovingly put-together collection of modern-retro titles from a batch of indie developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Evercade - Indie Heroes Collection 4 - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IuNvVeX5iEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This collection includes a stonking 11 different games, covering a range of genres, including puzzlers, platformers and action-adventures, meaning you’re going to have this particular cartridge stuck in the slot for weeks to come. There’s even a bit of Jane Austen in there, so you can assume that it’s also educational and perfect for anyone studying English Literature*. (*Evercade offers no guarantee of improved educational performance.)</p>
<p>The games on Indie Heroes Collection 4 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Curse of Illmoore Bay – Battle supernatural forces in this action-packed platformer.</li>
<li>Block’Em Sock’Em – A fun and fast-paced puzzle brawler where strategy meets chaos.</li>
<li>Nyghtmare: The Ninth King – Explore a haunting realm in this dark fantasy action-adventure.</li>
<li>Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure – Dive into a charming, literary-inspired journey filled with wit and puzzles.</li>
<li>Collie Defense – Strategically protect your territory in this quirky defense game.</li>
<li>Flea!2 – Bounce back into action with this zany sequel to the cult classic.</li>
<li>Batty Zabella – Embrace the spooky vibes in this delightfully eerie adventure.</li>
<li>Murtop – Explosive arcade fun meets burrowing mayhem in this high-energy retro game.</li>
<li>Soko Banana – A puzzling delight where you help a clever monkey navigate complex mazes.</li>
<li>Starseed – Embark on an intergalactic journey in this sci-fi action adventure.</li>
<li>Block Droppin’ – Test your reflexes in this addictive block-dropping arcade game.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sean Cleaver, Head of Marketing for Blaze Entertainment said, “With Indie Heroes Collection 4, we continue to celebrate the incredible creativity of the indie gaming community,” He continued, “This collection offers something for everyone, from gripping adventures to mind-bending puzzles and nostalgic platformers. It’s a testament to the thriving modern retro scene.”</p>
<p>The new cartridge will be part of the red-coloured home console line and be numbered #43, slotting perfectly into this awesome physical collection. The price of this cartridge will be £19.99, $24.99 and €24.99, and it will release at some point in February 2025. <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/indie-heroes-collection-4/">Pre-orders will open on January 30th from Evercade retailers</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – last day to sign up for the closed beta]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-%E2%80%93-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta.1080180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Game of Thrones furore seems like a long time ago. The original book, A Song of Ice and Fire was released in 1996, while the TV show finished in 2019. Still, “You know nothing, Jon Snow” remains part of our daily banter, and the series legacy on the page and the screen is as strong as ever, thanks to the ongoing House of the Dragon show filling in many of the world’s blanks. Netease are hoping to continue the franchise’s popularity with the arrival of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and today is the last day you can <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">sign up for the upcoming closed beta test</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is set for release later this year on iOS, Android and PC, and this closed beta will be the first time for players to go hands-on with the title. It was announced very recently at The Game Awards show, with the accompanying trailer certainly looking the part, capturing the bleak and wintry world of northern Westeros.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will see you take on the role of an unknown new character, who, through a quirk of fate, becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house in the north of Westeros. There’ll be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin. There’s going to be a focus on player vs player combat, and it looks as though it has a touch of For Honor about it, though whether it turns out to be as in-depth or challenging as Ubisoft’s game remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta will run January 16 to January 22nd for Android and PC, while the game will eventually launch on iOS as well. Netease are known for creating visually impressive titles, and their take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/ni-no-kuni-cross-worlds-review-ios-android-pc/">Ni No Kuni</a> was absolutely beautiful, even if the gameplay couldn’t match up to the original PS3 release. Game of Thrones has never managed to turn in a truly great video game adapatation, though the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/19/telltales-game-of-thrones-episode-six-the-ice-dragon-review/">Telltale series</a> did a decent enough job of bringing the world to life.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing how Game of Thrones: Kingsroad turns out, this is the perfect chance, though you only have <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt">today to get your sign-up in</a>! If you do take part then you’ll receive exclusive rewards for your character once the game officially launches later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals’ Season 1 arrives with new costumes, maps and more]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/marvel-rivals-season-1-arrives-with-new-costumes-maps-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-season-1-arrives-with-new-costumes-maps-and-more.1080168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/marvel-rivals-season-1-arrives-with-new-costumes-maps-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marvel Rivals is good, isn’t it? More chaotic and unbalanced than its inspiration, Overwatch, but that means it’s also wilder, less prescribed, and arguably a lot of fun. It helps that Marvel Rivals is packed full of recognisable comic-book characters, and the development team at NAME are already adding more to that roster with the arrival of Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night, with new characters Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman representing the Fantastic Four in a fan-friendly way. Seriously, between this and Pedro Pascale, expect to see a lot of Mr Fantastic fan art in the next few months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1 Battle Pass: Darkhold | Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FWR6mwGDTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most important arrival with Season 1 – Empire of Eternal Night is the new Battle Pass, entitled Darkhold. This book of the damned is thoroughly evil, so each of the new character skins gives them a darker vibe than you might be used to. Wolverine definitely has something of a Van Helsing vibe, while Moon Knight’s outfit is more like an eclipse than normal. As a Rocket Racoon main I’m looking forward to nabbing his Steampunk outfit for sure.</p>
<p>If you’re not trying to pimp out your current character, perhaps you’re planning on playing as one of the new ones. Duelist-class Mister Fantastic brings some Dhalsim-like stretchy melee to the mix, his limbs shooting out to smack enemies around, while he can also pump himself up to take more damage. His special sees him repeatedly bouncing up and down on a controllable area, which looks as though it’s going to cause absolute chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mister Fantastic: Stretching Into Action | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQjjy1po-ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also Mister Fantastic’s partner to think about. Sue Storm appears – or is that disappears? – as Invisible Woman, a Strategist class character bringing concussive blasts and shields to bear against her opponents. She can fire individual blasts, or use a powerful push to force enemies out of the way or bounce them off the side of a map which looks deeply annoying already.  Her special can hide an area from sight, stopping external characters from being able to see in, while trapping those inside.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Invisible Woman: Unseen Force | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhgYIMEG1Zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on who you’re playing as, there’s two new maps for you to explore. The first of these is the Sanctum Sanctorum, with Dr Strange’s mystic home appearing so that you can make a horrible mess of it. Stalking the halls, players can expect to see a variety of odd and unusual sights, while checking out a range of fan-teasing artwork, set off by a portrait of Dr Strange and his dog, Bats.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Empire Of Eternal Night: The Mystical Sanctum Sanctorum | Map Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVlerpIo3Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second new map is Midtown. Empire of the Eternal Night has seen Dracula and his cohort attacking New York, and here recognisable Marvel landmarks like the Baxter Building have clearly been having a hard time of it. There’s plenty of destruction for you to work your way around, all topped off by a cheeky inverted A on the Avengers building where the horizontal line blinks in and out so it looks like a ‘V’. For vampire, right?</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 – Empire of the Eternal Night launches on January 10th on all platforms, and also coincides with the game’s launch on GeForce Now, so you can indulge in the darker side of Marvel wherever you are!</p>
