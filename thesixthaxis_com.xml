		<p>Here’s a mouthful of a game title for you. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction has been given a release date by developer Bitmap Bureau and publisher Limited Run Games, with the side scrolling beat ’em up set to release of April 28th. To mark the announcement you can check out a new gameplay trailer below.</p>

<p>The description for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction says, <em>“As Eternia prepares for the Royal Festival of Light, Hover Bots attack the palace, revealing the dastardly plan: Skeletor and his allies kidnap King Randor and Queen Marlena and steal the Dragon Pearl! At Castle Grayskull, Skeletor drains the Sorceress’ power into the Pearl, shattering it across the kingdom and leaving her weak. Our heroes, He-Man, Teela, and Man-at-Arms, pursue him across Eternia in this authentic 16-bit tale of sword and sorcery, one 40 years in the making!”</em></p>
<p>For She-Ra fans, worry not as she is an unlockable character that can be used in the campaign. Each character has their own fight style, and He-Man can even ride Battle Cat into battle to take on Skeletor’s minions. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction will feature 12 stages to play through with two player local co-op supported. The game has been confirmed for PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
