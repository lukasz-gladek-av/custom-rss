		<p>Green Flamingo Games has announced a brand new 3D rhythm platformer called Spanky’s Battle Swing, and it takes inspiration from the cartoons of the 1930’s blending them with a soundtrack filled with electro swing jazz. The teaser trailer gives a glimpse at the platforming action, as well as a taster of the soundtrack.</p>

<p>In Spanky’s Battle Swing you play as Spanky The Bat as he navigates around the city of Metronopolis, a place where everything moves to the music. Spanky is not a fan of the constant noise and the way the city functions because of the music, so he is on a quest to shut it all up by getting to Mayor Metrognome. There are different districts in Metronopolis which each have their own music beats, tricks and guardians to take down. The key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhythm-Driven Platforming:</strong>&nbsp;Every foe, platform, and hazard moves to the beat—learn the pattern, bend the pattern,&nbsp;<strong>own</strong>&nbsp;the pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Electro-Swing Soundtrack:</strong>&nbsp;A punchy, dynamic score that keeps the city buzzing and your feet tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Vintage Cartoon Flair:</strong>&nbsp;A lively, personality-packed world with expressive characters and a 1930s-inspired look.</li>
<li><strong>Rebel Against the Beat:</strong>&nbsp;As Spanky, you can sync up… or go off-grid. Break timing rules to create your own openings and shut the city up—your way.</li>
</ul>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Spanky’s Battle Swing, but it will be coming out in 2026 for PC.</p>
