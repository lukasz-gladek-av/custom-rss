		<p>Frontier has now previewed what’s next for their latest theme park management game, Planet Coaster 2, with a new roadmap for May and June.</p>
<p>Arriving on 29th May is Update 5, which will include fan requested features like security guards and expanded colour customisations. The Sci-Fi theme will also return, while there’s two de-themed coasters that will allow for greater customisation alongside the returning Vector – Return Mk 2, and the maps from Act 3 of the career will be available in Sandbox mode.</p>



<p>Looking further ahead to June, Update 6 will bring Souvenir Shops and On-Ride Photos that will be sold at those shops (at no doubt extortionate prices!). There will be more stock coasters and the returning Coriolis ride, and then more ongoing stability and performance enhancements. Another returning theme is also teased, with Frontier saying that “It’s a real fairy tale come true.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 launched at the tail end of 2024, Frontier looking to find new ways to expand on their popular theme park game with a fresh release, instead of bolting on features with DLC and patches. In particular, they added new water park areas with water slides, wide plaza areas and more, though fans initially complained that it felt like a step back in terms of the number of themes and certain features, and some bugginess. Frontier has steadily worked to add more to the game since then, resolving key complaints and generally making improvements, and it seems that it’s kicking into gear with the next few updates.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/planet-coaster-2-review/">our Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Frontier’s park-building sequel is a vibe, it is a mood, and it is sunshine wrapped in a very bright bow. Minor control frustrations aside, it’s the best theme park builder out there, with impressively deep customisation, beautifully detailed visuals and the ability to make hours of your life melt away.”</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has revealed what players should expect in the first year of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with the studio releasing the year one roadmap for the game. Included in the first year are free missions called Story Drops, the first expansion called the Claws of Awaji, New Game+, and further updates to Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Year 1 Roadmap Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Claws of Awaji expansion, which will be available at no additional cost to those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows, will add the island of Awaji and continues the story of both Yasuke and Naoe following the epilogue of the main questline. Naoe will be getting a new weapon with that being the Bo Staff, which can be used to fight the new enemies that will be added to the game. Both characters will be getting additional abilities too.</p>
<p>Another new addition to Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be story drops, free quests that expand upon the backstories of various characters. These story drops will also add new abilities and new activities in the world. The first of these story drops will be “The Works of Luis Frois”, which will focus on the Jesuit scholar whose works had documented a lot of the Sengoku era of Japan. This story drop will be added in early made.</p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the parkour system in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be optimised and new interactions will be brought in. These include height-gaining back-ejects, reanimated height-gaining side-ejects, and a vertical ledge jumps so characters can grab on to awnings and low overhangs. There will be more parkour improvements added through the year. The photo mode will be improved too, with new poses, expressions, filters, stickers and ambient music. In June, the second community feedback update will be rolled out which will allow players to toggle headgear being visible in cutscenes, giving the option to disable weapon glints and stealth outlines, black-and-white and red ability filters, and assassination celebration effects. The alarm system will be expanded to the open world as well.</p>


<p>In our Assassin’s Creed Shadows review, Adrian said, <em>“Fans of Assassin’s Creed have waited an era or two for a series entry that lets you be a ninja and explore Feudal Japan. Thankfully, the wait has been absolutely worth it. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an astonishing achievement. Vast, impossibly detailed, immaculately researched, and enormously fun, Shadows is easily one of the best games in this storied franchise.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/may-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-features-balatro-boomer-shooting-dinos/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for May 2025 have been announced and it’s a pretty good month, featuring tons of dinosaurs, a great boomer shooter, and the Poker-inspired card dealing phenomenon that is Balatro.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus May 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 6th May – no kidding – and they will be available until 2nd June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> | PS5</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that it’s a celebrated Game of the Year contender and nominee from last year, Balatro is likely the biggest included here. The game is a roguelike that takes inspiration from Poker hands, asking you to play card combos in order to generate high scores, while collecting Joker cards that add multipliers, boosters and other effects as you play. It’s hugely addictive and was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">an easy winner for our Best Independent Game award in 2024</a>. </strong>Through 2025, it’s reached even more people as more awards have rolled in, and that attention has led to some interesting collaborations with much bigger budget games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Balatro - Short Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9agt18c_V1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An then there’s Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Before Space Marine 2 dropped into our laps last year, this was probably up there as the latest and greatest 40K shooter, leaning into the “Boomer Shooter” fad with retro graphics and retro FPS gameplay to match. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “The commitment to ‘the bit’ means that Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun stays true to its old-school shooter roots, with very little signposting, apart from the occasional spot of yellow marking to show you can climb up through an area. Otherwise, you’re left to your own devices. The same goes for storytelling, which extends to your servitor’s asides, short loading screen introductions to each area and the occasional cutscene. It doesn’t hurt it, but there were times where I yearned for a little more explanation.”</p>


<p>Rounding out this month’s selection is Ark: Survival Ascended, the current gen revamp of Ark: Survival Evolved within Unreal Engine 5. This remaster fully implements Unreal Engine’s Lumen lighting, Nanite mesh rendering, and all the other new technologies, while Studio Wildcard has gradually reimplemented all of the DLC maps from the original game over the course of the last year and a half – it’s still in Early Access with the final map planned for release in October. It hasn’t had the smoothest launch or reception, but the game has an enduring popularity regardless. Dinos, am I right?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the April 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 5th May March to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>

		<p>Evil Dead: The Game is being delisted from digital storefronts, Saber Interactive has announced. The statement the company has released follows the disappearance of the game from the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/evil-dead-the-game/">PlayStation Store,</a> among others. Those who own the game will not need to worry about servers being shut down, as it has been made clear that the servers for Evil Dead: The Game will remain online.</p>
<p><iframe title="Evil Dead: The Game - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiZqKiamYSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement on Steam, Saber Interactive said, <em>“We can confirm we’ve begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.”</em></p>
<p>The delisting of Evil Dead: The Game comes just shy of three years from the game’s launch date of May 13th, 2022, when it released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where four players face off against a number of villains controlled by another player. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/evil-dead-the-game-review/">Evil Dead: The Game Review</a>, Jim said, <em>“Evil Dead fans will love the amount of fan service on offer here, from the painstaking recreation of movie locations to Bruce Campbell’s goofy one-liners. However, when it comes to raw entertainment value, there’s an imbalance between the forces of good and evil. Playing as the survivors can be fun with friends but lacks the fun or variety of being an evildoer.”</em></p>
