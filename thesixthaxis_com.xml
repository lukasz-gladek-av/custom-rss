		<p>Nintendo has clarified that physical versions of Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> games will feature <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game cards, and will <em>not</em> be an original Switch card and a download code.</p>
<p>Various things have kicked up a storm in the wake of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, and one of the biggest bones of contention has been with regard to Switch 2 Editions upgrades of various games. Thanks to a mixture of ambiguous wording on Switch 2 Edition game packshots – see the gallery below – and erroneous statements by customer support, it was believed that Switch 2 Editions could be an original Nintendo Switch cartridge alongside an upgrade code to redeem at the Nintendo eShop.</p>


<p>We were caught up with this story as well, and apologise for the confusion.</p>

		
		

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition games – which includes upgrades for the likes of Breath of the Wild, Kirby and the Forgotten Lands and Super Mario Party Jamboree – will all be coming on the new red Switch 2 specific game cards. This means that they will not be usable with the original Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Third parties may make use of digital downloads in a box, or (while not explicitly stated) even the new Game Key cartridge, which acts as a digital license to download and play the game.</p>
<p>Of course, if you already have a game for Nintendo Switch, you will be able to purchase an upgrade via the eShop to get the added features and enhancements.</p>
<p>Switch 2 Editions are typically a mix of boosting game graphics and performance with a new build of the game for Switch 2 and added content. However, there are also a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>
