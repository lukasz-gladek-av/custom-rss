		<p>We are now in the top 30 of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> and here we’re hitting a mix of sequels, prequels, a much anticipated horror, and what could prove to be the ultimate mashup that will dominate 2026. Scroll down to find out what games have got into our top 30.</p>
<h2>30 – Slay The Spire II</h2>
<p><em>PC – “A secret Thursday in March 2026”</em></p>
<p>It was in early 2024 when we learned that smash-hit rogulike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> would be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/15/slay-the-spire-2-announced-with-early-access-in-2025/">getting a sequel</a>, and it’s safe to say it has big shoes to fill. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire II</a> is separated by 1000 years from the original game, which means new slayers, new cards, and new potions to use in the challenge to beat the Spire, which will contain new challenges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slay The Spire II was meant to be released into early access in 2025, with Mega Crit envisioning a year to 18 months before a full release. However, development delays meant early access did not take place when initially planned, instead now penned in for March 2026. We can only hope that Slay The Spire II is more worthy successor rather than the difficult second album.</p>

<h2>29 – Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It was in mid-2025 when Asobo Studio revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy-revealed-as-a-prequel-spin-off/">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a>, giving us a new game in the A Plague Tale universe, though setting it 15 years before the events of the main games. This spin-off sees a new main character in Sophia, a plunderer who finds herself on Minotaur Island fighting and trying to evade an army that is chasing her, with the possibility that the Minotaur will also make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lroYak-ryyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The description for Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy references two heroes as players will switch between the ancient Minoan civilisation and Sophia’s time. The gameplay will consist of fighting various enemies as they come for Sophia and solving the puzzles across Minotaur Island to discover answers to why Sophia is there.</p>
<h2>28 – Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> could easily end up as one of the most popular and best selling games of 2026 when it comes out in March. Take the popularity of Pokemon and blend it with the life sim vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, and you have something that very few fans of both franchises would be able to resist.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Pokopia | Extended Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Pokémon Pokopia, you play as a Ditto that has taken on human form who has decided to create a little slice of paradise for fellow Pokemon. Just like any other Ditto, Pokopia’s Ditto can learn moves and abilities from other Pokemon allowing it to find ways to craft the cosy little getaway. For example, Ditto can transform into Lapras to swim around the world or sprout Bulbasaur vines for some bush slashing. Ditto will have friends to help with the crafting of paradise with the likes of Professor Tangrowth, and as more spaces are created more Pokemon will be attracted to join your little commune.</p>
<h2>27 – Reanimal</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 13th February 2026</p>
<p>There is a lot of expectation behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. Coming from Tarsier Studios, the original developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares</a> and with a good long wait for their latest game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">Little Nightmares III</a> was not developed by Tarsier but Supermassive Games), and Reanimal looks like it could scratch that horror adventure vibe that made Little Nightmares so popular.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="REANIMAL Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACZL7VziLS8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reanimal looks familiar to Little Nightmares but this a new universe, a new story, and an emphasis on partnership as a brother and sister search for their friends and look for a way off the island that was once their home. The pair explore the remnants of their home by land and sea, going to once familiar locations that have been twisted and have their own horrifying stories. Reanimal has been designed to have the siblings experience things together, which means it is fully playable either solo or in co-op. We don’t have too long to wait as Reanimal is out in just over a month.</p>
<h2>26 – Gears of War: E-Day</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">its reveal in 2024</a> we have not heard much about Gears of War: E-Day, the prequel to the entire Gears of War franchise that will take us to the very start of the war with the Locust on Emergence Day. The game is being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">co-developed by The Coalition and People Can Fly</a>, with the teams putting players in the boots of young Marcus Phoenix and Dominic Santiago.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All we really know is that will see a Sera in the immediate aftermath of invasion rather than a fallen planet suffering from years of conflict. It’s also currently only announced for Xbox Series X|S and PC, even if last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5-review/">Gears of War Reloaded remaster brought the series to PS5 for the first time</a> with a day and date release. Anyway, for now, enjoy looking back at the reveal and its Mad World trailer above.</p>
<p><em>Did any of these games resonate with you? Come back tomorrow and we’ll have five more as we break into the top half of our list.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sneakily watch this 9 minute gameplay video for Styx: Blades of Greed]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/sneakily-watch-this-9-minute-gameplay-video-for-styx-blades-of-greed/</link>
            <guid>1398037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> on 19th February, Nacon and developer Cyanide have released a 9 minute gameplay video to showcase various elements of its stealth action shenanigans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/609Oad5kwCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Styx provides the narration through the video, using a bunch of new and returning gadgets and abilities to scale a vertical fortress and reach the next preserve of Quartz. Key new abilities that are shown off include using a gappling hook and floating up hot air streams with a glider, but there’s also returning elements like poisoning barrels, possessing enemies and creating gloopy clones. Add to that genre classics of dousing flames, skulking through vents and just observing and listening for new opportunities, and you’ve got the broadest stealth game in this series to date.</p>
<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which led to a spin off series of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control, but he’ll have to build a team of allies (reluctant and otherwise) to do so, while making his way through the domains of humans, elves and orcs alike, the gang flying back and forth in a Zeppelin as their base of operations.</p>
<p>The trailer ends with this base under attack, as another fleet of airships catches up to Styx and his crew!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom last year, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A surprise Dragon Quest VII Reimagined demo is coming this week]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/</link>
            <guid>1398034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has a nice surprise for Dragon Quest fans, <a href="https://xcancel.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979">announcing a demo for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> that will be available from tomorrow, Wednesday 7th January.</p>
<p>The free demo will be released across all platforms: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>


<p>Oh, and you’ll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on 5th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Opening Movie | DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL2-tty-p4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s great to see demos released for games, and especially for remakes where you kind of just want to see if it catches the right vibes and tone when reviving a classic.</p>

<p>Square Enix have taken an awful lot of contrasting approaches to their remakes and remasters. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game last year, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview/">I said in our preview</a>, “Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives [in 2026].”</p>
