		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>Whether this is a religious holiday for you or not, here’s hoping that you’re able to gather together with family and maybe a few friends, sharing time and merriment with as many of the loved ones in your life as possible over the next few days. Gifts will be exchanged, families with young children will have those flurries of chaotic excitement as wrapping paper is torn apart, and more than a few sweets and little tipples to fill the wait for Christmas Dinner!</p>
<p>So, on&nbsp;behalf of all the writers here at TheSixthAxis, I want to wish you, your families and your friends Happy Holidays and a very Merry Christmas!</p>
<hr>
<p>2024 has been another one of those years filled with challenges for many people and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With wars still raging in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we hope for peace and resolution, and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>
<p>These hopes might be fruitless , but if you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>

<p>While Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, if you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support. You can reach them via the above links or at the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samaritans – call 116 123</li>
<li>Shout – text SHOUT to 85258</li>
<li>Childline – call 0800 1111 between 7:30 and 3:30pm every day</li>
<li>Mind – call their infoline on 0300 123 3393</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s so many different charities and causes out there that you can support and,&nbsp;if you’re in a position to do so, we would encourage you to do just that.</p>
