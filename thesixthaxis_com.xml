		<p>TankHead has a release date and that release date is… today! That’s right, the thoroughly unusual tank combat, survival and scavenging game TankHead is out now, exclusively on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="TankHead - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyZo9AC0bsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TankHead takes place in an apocalyptic setting where the war-torn world of ECA has become almost entirely uninhabitable. It’s because of this that Whitaker needs to tele-project his consciousness into a Needle drone that can survive the harsh environment. Also pilot a tank. That’s also quite important.</p>
<p>Heading into the wasteland, you’ll need a tank, but you’ll have to scavenge and cobble it together from parts. collecting new weapons, wheels, armour, spare parts, engines and more to improve your vehicle.</p>
<p>Because of the scrappily put together tanks you have, you’ll need a tactical approach to combatting the enemy tanks you face, always trying to present your strongest side – you have separate control of the tank’s direction and the turret – evade incoming fire as much as possible and chip away at their armour to reveal weak points to target.</p>

<p>The better and cleaner the vicoty, the more valuable the loot you can recover from the burning carcass of your fallen foes, grabbing replacement parts and upgrades for your tank.</p>
<p>It all culminates in battles against truly bizarre boss tanks, which in the trailer seems to include a very angry walking hotel or river boat?</p>

		<p>Veewo Games has revealed Neon Abyss 2, a sequel to their hit run ‘n’ gun roguelike from 2020. Neon Abyss 2 is heading to Steam Early Access in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Neon Abyss 2 aims to take everything that was great about the original and amp it up to 11. There’s a wild range of weapons, from deadly plants to dragon-like creatures, all of which will shift your combat style in tandem with synergistic power-ups that you will combine and evolve through each run. You can also still hatch and train new companions, evolving them into allies that will fight alongside you.</p>
<p>And there’s now a Faith system that can be used to power up, recruit allies, or gamble away.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course there’s still minigames, with the trailer wrapping up with a little bit of basketball.</p>

		<p>Clear Endeavour Games has revealed Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, their bike racing party game successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ultimate-chicke-horse">Ultimate Chicken Horse</a> set to launch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ultimate Sheep Raccoon Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4hC8GudgBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to Ultimate Chicken Horse, you’re all in a race to survive and reach the finish line of a level, replaying it multiple times to decide a winner… except that between each round players are able to lay deadly traps and modify the level, making it harder and harder to survive.&nbsp;Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, however, puts you all on bikes instead of having you platform around – it’s a bit more Trials-like in that regard, and you can earn bonus points for pulling off tricks.</p>
<p>Helping you survive will be power-ups, including jetpacks, parachutes to glide, bouncy mines to off your rivals, and more. Helping to make things utterly awful and hilarious are all of the traps and level parts, whether it’s adding rails, ramps and bouncy pads, or pendulums, spikes and laser-emitting TVs.</p>
<p>There’s returning characters in the form of Chicken, Horse, Sheep and Racoon, as well as a bunch of new barnyard animals… because this game support up to 8 players! There’s local, online and cross-platform multiplayer, so anyone and everyone can hop into the game together.</p>

<p>For now, though, the only confirmed platform is PC, and you can wishlist on Steam.</p>
