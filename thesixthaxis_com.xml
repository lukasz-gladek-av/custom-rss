		<p>Developer Project Cloud Games has released a brand new extended gameplay trailer for its upcoming semi open world action RPG The Relic: First Guardian. This trailer shows one of the missions that the Guardian, the main character of the game, will undertake with this one taking place in a burning village which is being ransacked and put to the sword.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Relic: First Guardian - Extended Gameplay Trailer (Coming Early 2026)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dasDB7PohU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Relic: First Guardian’s extended gameplay trailer shows how the combat plays, with it being very fast paced with this guardian armed with twin daggers. However, they are just one of five weapon options with each having their own skills. Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes, items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. The burning village features just one of 70 bosses that players will face, with the stories and bosses inspired by Korean folklore. Each of the bosses has their own full background so you can find out why they do what they do. In this particular scenario, the boss is Branka the Blood Stained Shield who is leading the massacre of the village.</p>
<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void. The hope is that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void. The Relic: First Guardian is expected to launch in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
