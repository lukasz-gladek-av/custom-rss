		<p>It’s the grand finale of the F1 championship this weekend, and I can’t quite believe how close it’s managed to end up. It should still be in Lando’s control, but as we’ve seen from the last two months of racing, with McLaren DNFs, DSQs and retrospective strategy bungles, it’s kept things just about possible for Max and Oscar. Tomorrow’s race will either end up being terribly dull or massively exciting.</p>
<p>But for video games, we’re well into trailers and awards season for the final month of the year, with a big glut of 2026 game trailers (and some final 2025 ones) already dropping this week, and a metric ton of them set to come next week as well at The Game Awards.</p>
