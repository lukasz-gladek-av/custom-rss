		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for August 2025, with the letters of the month being P and Z.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus August 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 5th August:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>My Hero One’s Justice 2</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/13/lies-of-p-review/"><strong>Lies of P</strong></a> is a standout soulslike, taking inspiration from the classic puppet turned real boy tale of Pinocchio. We gave it a glowing review back in 2023, saying “Smooth combat, seamless exploration and a set of well-executed mechanics makes Lies of P an excellent Soulslike. When you add in the gorgeous visuals, desolate world design, stark sound design and engrossing story, it raises the experience above a lot of its contemporaries. All in all, although Lies of P is essentially Bloodborne featuring Timothée Chalamet, it does more than enough to mark itself out as a unique title worth your time – and I’m not lying.”</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s also the recently released Overture DLC to sink into if you enjoy this freebie enough.</p>


<p>That might be a hard act to follow, but the online survival action of DayZ provides a major change of pace. The game has grown and improved a lot since its original release in 2018, with last year seeing the release of a third major map with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/dayz-update-1-25-live-as-major-dlc-goes-free/">the DayZ Frostline expansion</a>, putting more emphasis on world temperature, clothing, food, and even letting you catch a cold. At the same time, the previous Livonia DLC was bundled into the game, and we now have the Badlands DLC to look forward to in 2026.</p>

<p>And finally, My Hero One’s Justice is a 3D brawler based on the hit anime superhero show. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/04/my-hero-ones-justice-2-review/">our review</a>, we said “It carries on the fine work put in on the first game, wraps the more recent story beats into a playable form, and buffs the already excellent visuals up to a new Shonen shine. It’s not a great jumping on point for newcomers, at least story-wise, but it remains a fun, approachable fighter based on one of the best anime shows of recent years.”</p>
