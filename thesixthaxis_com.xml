		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> patch, with hotfix 1.1.2 targeting a clutch of crash bugs so the game won’t keel over when “looking at certain locked doors”, “interacting with a cart” or when “spamming keys on the EULA screen”.</p>
<p>I think spamming keys at the EULA is pretty much universal gamer behaviour, because who’s got time in their finite lives to actually read that legalese gibberish? But once you actually get into the game, looking at doors of all kinds and interacting with carts are both pretty integral to the immersive medieval experience that KCD2 provides.</p>


<p>I’m poking a little bit of fun, of course, and it’s always good to see developers stamping out the odd little bugs and crashes that inevitably remain in games after release. Warhorse has plenty plans for more support with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions/">three major questline expansions coming through the rest of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched at the start of February to plenty of praise from critics – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our KCD2 review here</a> – and players alike, continuing down the immersive RPG style of the original. The game has already turned a profit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/542223437984170029">on its way to 2 million sales</a>, and the positive word of mouth could see that number keep on climbing, even in an absolutely stacked start to the year with big game releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the KCD2 Hotfix 1.1.2 patch notes:</p>
