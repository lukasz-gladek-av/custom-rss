			<p>Finally, the world’s first yassified boomer shooter. Originally, we started calling DOOM-style shooters ‘boomer shooters’ because it called back to the aged, hyper-masculine games of that era that seemed to be inspiring a modern resurgence of games in that style. In recent years, though, the subgenre has taken on a life of it’s own, fully removed from those retro inspirations – and in many cases, the people who play these games and the fanbases that form for them are a far cry from the traditional bro-gamer image that someone might tie to DOOM or Quake or Duke Nukem.</p>
<p>Games like Ultrakill and Neon White prove that nontraditional audiences are dying for nontraditional games that capture the style and essence they call home. It felt like the eventual endpoint for boomer shooters: to create a game fully built on femininity and glam in the modern Charlie XCX brat summer tone, rather than the all-too-familiar Barbie pastiche that “games for girls” immediately evoke. <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!&nbsp;</em>is unabashedly a game for the gals, made by the gals. While the spirit and style is there in awesome excess, though, I think the gals deserve a game with more polish and quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Don't Stop, Girlypop! | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yi8C56wBsF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em>, in the best way possible, feels like a scrappy indie hyperpop zine lovingly made in Unreal Engine. From the moment you turn the game on, the bright, bubbly buttons on the menu evoke early-2000s maximalist web design. You press New Game, and suddenly you’re a fairy warrior named Imber being aided by an FMV companion who talks to you through a pink glam’d out flip phone – your mission is to defend your neon pink planet from the Tigris Nix corporation draining it of all The Love. It’s weird, and silly, and barely explained and hardly complicated – but also, like, yes girl, your gun is pink, and your phone is pink, and your enemies need to explode.</p>
<p>The game is maximalist and overindulgent and unashamed with its tone and style, and I can’t fault it for any of that. One of the things I love the most about indie games is their potential to be a canvas for expression and unorthodox art, and no part of the art here feels like a cruel parody – it’s all steeped in a sincerity and barely-holding-back-a-laugh sense of humour that is so charming.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the game is way too rough around the edges to make up for that scrappy charm and style. From the start of the game, there’s an awkward sort of floatiness to…everything. The camera hangs awkwardly in cutscenes, and there’s a sort of unfinished vibe to the inconsistent way various early in-game tutorials pop up. Characters are voiced, but some of them sound like they’re hardly putting in any effort, while others are almost mute-the-game levels of annoying in how repetitive their efforts are.</p>
<p>Early on, you encounter a boss, your flip-phone companion summons some giant speakers, and loud hyperpop blasts all around you as you fight this foe. It’s an amazing moment on paper, but the pacing of the dialogue delivery, the lack of animated or sound-designed emphasis for the speakers appearing, and the awkward way the song restarts after the cutscene ends and the actual gameplay begins make it hard to fully appreciate the idea when the execution is so lacking.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em> has an interesting premise for combat – you’re supposed to never stop moving in this game, and you’ve got a huge speed multiplier visible on-screen at all times that goes up if you jump, dash, kill, grapple, or wave hop. Wave hopping, as explained by the game, is a unique forward boost of momentum you can trigger by jumping, ground-slamming, jumping back up, and dashing forward. I love the kind of frenetic, sweat-inducing energy that a shooter creates when you’re tasked with nonstop movement – it’s a big reason why I love <em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>so much. In this game, though, while the idea is solid, your core movement fundamentals feel just a bit sloppy.</p>

<p>You move with snail-like slowness when your multiplier is at zero, making the start of each run or any moment you stop to listen to a story-focused audio echo feel a bit awkward. The wave hop, while satisfying upon successful execution, is just a bit too involved to be executed constantly like the game expects you to. And some mechanics like wall-running and grappling just straight-up do not work properly sometimes, leading to lots of moments where I’m just sort of mashing buttons to force out some helpful movement without a clear or consistent understanding of how I’ll move or how fast I am.</p>
<p>Guns are pretty great in this game, though. <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em> gives you a non-traditional set of weapons. Your most basic one is a stake-firing sniper rifle where your alt-fire is just a scoped zoom, but you’ve also got <em>the magic wand.&nbsp;</em>This acts like a cutesy gravity gun and pulls the nearest heavy object toward you so you can blast it at your enemy of choice. There’s also an uzi-style bubble gun where the alt fire lays down a barrage of harmless pink bubbles, and a single shot from your primary fire or any other weapon sets them all off in a beautiful cascading explosion. Finally, you’ve got a three-round shotgun with my favourite alt-fire of all – shoot out a slowly floating disco ball, and then hit it with your primary fire to cause gunfire and shrapnel to rain out in every direction. There’s also a heavy-hitting railgun you find later in the game, but by the time I found it, I was pretty set with the rest of my arsenal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you only get about 4 hours of campaign missions to spend firing these incredible guns and fiddling with the so-so movement options before the campaign wraps up. After that, there’s nothing else. No challenges, no endless waves, no remixed missions. It’s a short-but-sweet campaign, but the lack of any replayability at all is a bit of a bummer. All in all, though, I’m not sure how much I would have been clamouring to re-play <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em>. While there are so many fun ideas here, there’s a lack of polish across so many areas of the game that keep those ideas from shining as much as I wanted them to.</p>

		<p>It’d be a brave person to suggest to their other half that they’d like to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> as a Valentine’s Day game. Yes, it’s co-op, but you’re also running and sneaking through the world trying to avoid horrifying modified animal monstrosities. Then again, maybe that’s preferable to the tensions that head-to-head game of tennis can bring, even if’s a bright, colourful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a> game. Maybe it’s best for couples to avoid both of this week’s biggest releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For a long time, the episodic adventure game as established by Telltale Games has been declared dead and buried. Which is a shame, because at their peak, Telltale produced some of my favourite ever games; The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead – Season 1, heck, I even have a weird soft spot for mega-flop Batman: The Telltale Series. So, I was delighted as much as anyone when Dispatch released last year to rave reviews and went on to sell millions of copies. Conclusively proving that the episodic choose-your-own-adventure narrative formula still had an audience, fans just needed a decent game that released on time and to schedule for them to reach for their credit cards again. And surely Switch gamers would love a slice of that too, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Well yes, of course they would, but maybe not like this. If you’ve glanced at the score before reading this review, please, let me reassure you, I don’t think for one moment that Dispatch is only a slightly better than average game. You see, Dispatch itself is great. The problem lay elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch | Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/flCnsbSrYuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For those who haven’t heard of Dispatch, it’s basically a modestly interactive feature-length animation divided into eight episodes. Segmenting the story are a series of puzzle elements. The first sees retired superhero Robert Robertson the Third in his new job as a superhero dispatcher, though he’s tasked with sending a group of reformed supervillains to time sensitive emergencies. Looking at a map screen, you assess the crises before sending the best member of the Z-Team to deal with the problem. This is a pleasant enough diversion but is lightweight and far too easy, with the game signalling so blatantly which member of your hero squad to use that you really can’t fail.</p>
<p>The second puzzle element involves hacking into various computers, which is far more interesting. You guide your hacking bot through a veritable maze, dodging viruses and cracking codes as you go. With mechanics that meaningly develop from episode to episode, this is a challenging and satisfying mini game, with genuine thrills delivered by racing against time to rescue one of your teammates, hack into a safe, or access some vital CCTV footage.</p>


<p>The story of Dispatch is brilliantly told, it’s a delightful superhero yarn providing memorable characters, whip-smart dialogue, laugh out loud tomfoolery, and some surprisingly emotional moments too. Voice over performances are off-the-chart fantastic, with a veritable who’s who of actors delivering the most believable and absorbing dialogue I’ve ever experienced in a video game. Visually, Dispatch looks phenomenal too, with slick sumptuous visuals and smooth animation, ensuring the characters will live on in your memory long after the story has finished.</p>
<p>Less successful? Well, there’s the slightly pathetic QTE inputs during fight scenes, that are so half-hearted they feel like an afterthought. Then there are the dialogue choices themselves. Now, this genre has always required a hefty amount of smoke and mirrors for the player to believe that any of their choices really matter. That was true in The Walking Dead and it’s true in Dispatch. More often than not, whatever time-sensitive dialogue option you make, the story briefly deviates from its prescribed path before re-joining the overall narrative again. Nothing really changes, certainly nothing important. Dispatch suffers from the fact that most of the choices you make are so blatantly inconsequential that you can just leave the game to play itself and you’ll make it to the end of the episode unscathed. But every now and again, the game throws an absolute dozy of a moral choice at the player; and these are worth the price of admission alone. When Dispatch finally stops pulling its punches, it hits hard, resulting in the kind of uncomfortable ethical moments that will prompt hours of conversation between players, just what did you decide to do?</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch conversion is excellent, playing equally well docked or handheld. So, what’s the big problem? As you might have already gathered if you’d paid attention over the last couple of weeks, it’s all down to the bizarre censorship.</p>

<p>Dispatch is an adult game. It’s eighteen-rated and explores grown-up themes. It’s violent, sweary, and includes full-frontal nudity and sex scenes. Unfortunately, it’s the last of these two distinctly adult things that is getting the redacted documents treatment with some of the clumsiest censoring we’ve ever seen. You know how beautiful the visuals and animation of Dispatch are? We’ll get ready for them to be ruined by enormous black censorship rectangles being stuck on top of them!</p>
<p>A character raises a middle finger? Well, dear person over eighteen, you’re not permitted to see that – look at a big black censorship rectangle instead. Someone’s naked bum is revealed? I’m afraid, person over eighteen, despite you having a bum too, you can’t see that. Breasts? That’s not OK either. A flaccid penis? Simply unacceptable. That’s right, natural bits of a human body cannot be looked at, but gratuitous swearing and bloody violence are apparently not a problem.</p>
<p>The reason for the censorship is a little unclear, with AdHoc saying <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">they worked with Nintendo to meet platform ‘content criteria’</a>, Nintendo then saying AdHoc could have taken a different approach <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">so long as games meet guidelines for ratings bodies</a>, and AdHoc then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">not exactly explaining what happened or if there’s a real path forward</a>. The speculation is that a single version of the game was submitted for all regions, meaning that they adhered to the CERO D rating in Japan and that this version was shipped everywhere. Other games, like Cyberpunk 2077, have multiple versions, but even with a single global approach, the method here is far too heavy-handed.</p>
<p>AdHoc Studio could have elected to edit the scenes in question, they could have chosen to pixelate or blur, but instead they elected to stick black rectangles everywhere, taking the player out of the moment entirely. One moment, I kid you not, the entire screen was covered in one enormous rectangle. The effect of this decision is calamitous; jokes are regularly ruined and it becomes difficult to tell what’s going on sometimes. Worse still, an incredibly affecting twist in the penultimate episode is entirely ruined by the big black censorship rectangle of doom. With Dispatch on Switch, AdHoc Studio had an open goal. Somehow, they’ve managed to perform an elaborate bicycle kick and hoofed the proverbial football into their own net.</p>
