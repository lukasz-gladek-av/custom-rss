		<p>PIONER’s beta has ended and developer GFA Games has released an update on what players should expect next as part of the game’s development journey. First off, GFA Games has confirmed that anyone who took part in the open beta will get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals, which is PIONER’s premium currency, should they purchase the game when it releases.</p>

<p>The PIONER open beta did have lots of issues identified by players, including progression saving bugs and server stability issues. On these issues, GFA Games said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort. <wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release. <wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>In addition, there will be a further PIONER stress test, but GFA Games has not yet confirmed when that will be. PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. The devs still have 2025 as a targeted release window but with only around six weeks until the end of the year, that does seem like a short amount of time to implement fixes and do a new stress test.</p>
