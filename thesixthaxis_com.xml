		<p>Valve has posted an update about the upcoming release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">Steam Machine, Steam Frame and new Steam Controller</a>, but it’s not exactly the best of news.</p>
<p>Since announcing the three products on 12th November last year, we’ve been waiting for Valve to confirm a release date and pricing, but they are still unable to do so. “When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” they say, “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.&nbsp; The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</p>


<p>“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>To be clear, this does not mean that the launches themselves have been delayed – we have no details on what their plans were outside of the broad first half of 2026 window – but Valve’s ability to make such announcements definitely has.</p>
<p>In November, there was broad speculation about how Valve might price the Steam Machine, in particular. The company did make statements to the effect that they would not be subsidising the hardware in the manner of a games console, and so many had expectations that the price could be around $700 or even higher. However, that was&nbsp;<em>just</em> before the PC hardware market went completely haywire with companies like OpenAI pre-booking massive amounts of memory, storage and more to feed their intention to build lots of new server farms to feed the AI bubble even further. RAM is now massively more expensive, as production lines are now being adapted to create the more intensive types of memory that helps AI models run quicker, Micron has retired their consumer-facing Crucial brand, and even older generation DDR4 RAM is seeing increased demand as people hunt for any kind of decent pricing at all.</p>

<p>The immediate impact has been felt with PC components and companies without stockpiled parts like Raspberry Pi, but this can and likely will affect everything else, from current gen console pricing through 2026-27, to next-gen console launch plans and pricing, to smart phones, even cars and washing machines. Everything needs RAM, CPUs and storage these days, and it’s all being gobbled up.</p>
<p>Speaking of components, Valve did also confirm in an attached FAQ that they are supporting the use of NVMe SSDs in the 2230 or 2280 form factor, memory that is DDR5 SODIMMs (though not the speed they intend to use), and that both of these areas will be accessible for upgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, Valve’s own testing says that the “majority” of Steam games are able to play at 4K and 60FPS with the use of FSR upscaling. However, given the Radeon RX 7600 chip that the system features, ”&nbsp;there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins – Visions of Four Heroes Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/dynasty-warriors-origins-visions-of-four-heroes-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After successfully reinvigorating the franchise formula with last year’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, I was eager to see where <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> would go next with the series and whether we’d see an “Xtreme Legends” expansion similar to past games. While it may not share the same XL name, the newly-released Visions of Four Heroes DLC is certainly XL in spirit, offering more than just a bonus cluster of campaigns for players to hack and slash their way through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dynasty Warriors: Origins - Visions of Four Heroes Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7uuXeeYsIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the name implies, this first major expansion for Dynasty Warriors: Origins centres on four main characters: Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, and Lu Bu. They represent the four powerful antagonists players encounter early on in the series’ Romance of the Three Kingdoms storyline, this DLC effectively giving each one of them a shot at redemption. Even the nasty, tyrannical Dong Zhou!</p>


<p>Not everyone was particularly keen on Origins and the developer’s decision to sack off the usual stacked roster of playable characters in favour of a single enigmatic protagonist. However, as we discussed at the time, Ziluan serves as somewhat of a handy conduit, his mystic trappings allowing him to flit between opposing factions and characters, at least during those early chapters. This gave us a more enriched overview of the setting, story, and the warring perspectives of its key players, where other <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> games typically force you down one of three, faction-aligned tunnels. In Visions of Four Heroes, Ziluan’s penchant for side-swapping gets dialled up to eleven as he travels through time to help out characters who are traditionally viewed as franchise villains.</p>
<p>It’s this kind of thoughtful narrative exploration that marks Dynasty Warriors: Origins as such a turning point for the series. Let’s take the first of the Four Heroes, Zhang Jiao, as a good example. Those who have been playing Shin Sangoku Musou since its debut will remember him as the crazy-haired wizard who lays claim to some of the most chuckle-worthy English-dubbed lines of the PS2 era. Origins completely drops that caricature image, however, portraying him as somewhat of a tragic figure – a religious leader who rallied thousands of famine-stricken peasants, even though their unchecked rebellion would have a devastating impact.</p>


<p>Each new story chapter in Visions of Four Heroes featured a handful of large-scale battles, sandwiched between cutscenes and occasional visits to the new hub-like Inn where players can also partake in new arena style challenges. In order to access the DLC, you will need to have hit certain milestones in the core campaign. Basically, once you’ve defeated each of the four featured characters, their chapter becomes playable.</p>
<p>New story content isn’t the only thing Visions adds to the game; there are two new weapon types, including the Bow and the Rope Dart. As with the core Origins arsenal, each one has its own unique playstyle and mechanics. The bow, for instance, can seamlessly switch between melee and ranged attacks by holding the block button, successive hits allowing you to unleash a powerful charged shot. These weapons have their own progression paths and unlockable special abilities too, with all base weapons from the game having been supercharged with additional ranks for the expansion.</p>
<p>Visions also introduces a new way of framing larger conflicts with its “Strategic Battles”. You’ll encounter several of these in the DLC, each one transporting the player to a smaller, more self-contained map where individual enemy and allied units take turns to move and engage. Left to their own devices, units will whittle down one another’s troop reserves before moving onto the next fight though, amidst all this, players can use one of their actions per turn to join in these skirmishes: smaller bouts of hack n’ slash combat that typically require you to defeat a general or capture a main base.</p>

<p>In truth, there’s not much scope for feats of tactical genius. To reduce friction and make the battles themselves a little easier, you’ll want to join fights where your allies are struggling, preventing their unit from being routed which would reduce your total troop count in the final battle. To help with this, a handful of Tactics can be used while navigating the world map, buffing allies and hampering enemies before a skirmish has even started. Each minor victory will also reward you with a panel of Secret Tactics that can be used in combat, such as the ability to summon a hurricane, or create an area of effect that charges your Musou gauge.</p>
<p>While Strategic Battles lack true tactical depth, they’re a clever way of reframing what would otherwise be a straightforward gauntlet of battles for each chapter in the DLC. It’s not hard to imagine Omega Force evolving this concept for when the studio (hopefully) delivers an Empires-style spin-off for its Dynasty Warriors reboot.</p>

		<p>Krafton’s top-down tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg-blindspot">PUBG: Blindspot</a> is out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam Early Access</a>, and it’s a free-to-play game that’s worth checking out for fans of this kind of genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5qFiL2pdWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PUBG: Blindspot might share the branding of the hit battle royale, but it’s a totally different style of game. This is a 5v5 team shooter that’s all about lines of sight with a shared team vision, controlling angles and close quarters combat with an element of destruction. New content is already planned, including the defence character Blaze, the addition of Molotov Cocktails for area control.</p>
<p>The early access launch is the start of open development that will take on feedback from the player base to inform the updates, balance and future updates. It’s available for free at this time, and per the FAQ on Steam, it’s planned to stay in early access for around one year, after which Krafton “plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items.”&nbsp;The game will almost immediately kick into a seasonal structure, with Competitive Season 1 launching on 12th February.</p>
<p>“Early Access allows players to become active participants in the development process,” said Seungmyeong Yang, Production Director of PUBG: BLINDSPOT. “By launching as a free-to-play title and developing openly with the community, we aim to shape PUBG: BLINDSPOT together through ongoing communication and frequent updates.”</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this game late in 2024 saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>
