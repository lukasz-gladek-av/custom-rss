		<p>After years of successful collaborations with different video game franchises, Sony has struck a deal with Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast directly, selling their best-known characters directly into Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>Launching on 27th October, seven direct-to-consumer products will arrive in a limited print run as part of the PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop. These are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part I</li>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part II</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Greek</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Norse</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Uncharted</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Horizon: Into the Forbidden West</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Ghost of Tsushima</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ‘Secret Lair’ is a set list of usually five or six defined cards, and will feature the characters and lore of the associated franchise. While the full card lists are yet to be announced, you can be sure we will cover each of them as we know more, ahead of each one launching.</p>
<p>The first drop, featuring God of War’s Kratos and his son Atreus, goes on sale on October 27th at 5pm UK time (9am Pacific Time).</p>


<p>You need to beware generally sell out within an hour, so if you’re a fan, make sure you sign up for alerts at secretlair.wizards.com.</p>
<p>Hasbro’s best-selling cash cow, MTG —&nbsp;which made a whopping 82% of their operating profits last year — has just come off <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/why-magic-is-how-it-is-in-2025-and-why-everything-changed">a record-breaking quarter for profits</a>, thanks to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/"> the Square Enix collaboration</a>, at 95%.</p>
<p>‘Universes Beyond’, the subsection of Magic with direct tie-ins to real-world franchises, has been crucial to Hasbro’s bottom line, featuring the likes of Doctor Who, Cloud Strife and SpongeBob Squarepants (rather than original characters like ‘Magic’s Pikachu’ Loot, or his carers Jace and Vraska), widening the appeal of the game to new fandoms.</p>
<p>The summer’s MTG x Final Fantasy release was an unprecedented success, with its employees noting that they simply couldn’t print the product fast enough. This lead to the scenes earlier this year where Collector Booster boxes were selling for $1k apiece.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop is significantly smaller in scale than MTG x Final Fantasy was, which contained several hundred unique cards. Instead, this is seven sets of defined cards, which will sell for a significantly lower price — $39.99 for the regular versions or $49.99 for the foil (shiny) versions (or the equivalent amount in your local currency).</p>
<p>And unlike MTG x Final Fantasy, which could be bought from your local Waterstones, these Secret Lair drops can only be bought from WotC directly, as part of a very limited print run… before hitting the secondary market at a massively inflated price.</p>
<p>While the more recent Spider-Man collaboration with Disney’s Marvel has yet to appear in financial reports, community sentiment seems to be that it has not sold as well. Indeed, resale prices for individual cards are, on the whole, significantly lower than their Final Fantasy counterparts.</p>
<p>We will bring you more information on each of these secret lairs, and whether the cards within them are any good, as soon as we know more.</p>

			<p>A Nickelodeon dungeons and dragons style mash up sounds very good on paper, drawing on characters from across their many different IP to take up various roles from a tabletop fantasy RPG. That’s what Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does that well, as Timmy from Fairly Oddparents transforms into a wizard and SpongeBob becomes a knight, but outside of the cartoon mashup, this is quite a basic game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPHWEJK_7U0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny, Timmy wishes to be transported into the world of one of his favourite games. However, the wish goes wrong and pulls in characters from other shows, as well as dungeons based upon various Nickelodeon shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and enemies inspired by the shows to boot. Battling through the world renders this as an isometric action RPG, and while you’re probably not expecting genre-beating graphics, what’s odd is that character models look desaturated. Katara looks deathly pale and far from her normal skin tone. This desaturations is mostly noticeable on characters with the levels themselves looking better with more vibrant colours.</p>


<p>Between levels you end up in a hub called The Tangle, filled with shops and side missions. It is also here where you can switch between characters to try out which playstyle is best for you. As mentioned, Timmy is a wizard with range attacks, while SpongeBob is a knight so gets closer in. Other characters fall into the rogue, barbarian and healer roles, which works for multiplayer. In single player, picking one character is better after a little experimentation. I ended up sticking with Timmy due to his range and ability to target multiple enemies.</p>


<p>Each character has special abilities to use too to deal with more powerful enemies and groups of them, but the majority of the time you will be using the same basic attacks which can get repetitive, even if you do switch characters. The game throws weapons, armour, talismans, and consumables at you, so there is always better gear. These can be found in chests, from completing challenges, buying them from the shop, and defeating bosses.</p>
<p>Levels themselves are pretty linear though a few do have some winding paths and one has you working out which portals to use to move forward. These variations are far between, with the majority of levels looking fine and different across worlds, but being samey in playstyle makes things a bit uninteresting. You can tell effort has gone into crafting levels that use the Nickelodeon shows as inspiration, but more could be done.</p>

<p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny’s story is fine and does draw on humour from the various shows it uses, but do not expect anything with depth. This is definitely aimed at a younger audience, so things are easy to follow. It is all voice acted and it is decent, though it could be stronger. There are some performance issues present in the game too, playing the Switch 1 version of the game on Switch 2. Some cutscenes just glitched with frames jumping back and forth, overlaying on each other in a way that hurt to watch. There were also a few times where characters would get stuck while moving around levels.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does have entertainment value to it, especially for a younger audience, but those looking for a nostalgic trip revisiting Nickelodeon characters might be a bit disappointed due to how basic the gameplay and levels are. There are also technical hitches that need to be addressed.	</p></div>

		<p>It’s MMORPG update season, and Metin2, Gameforge’s long-running free-to-play entry in the genre, looks set to receive its latest update next month, with the Tyranny of Aamon arriving this November. In the run-up to its release, though, the game will be running a month-long pre-event phase to get players prepped and ready for the host of new features this new update will bring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metin2: Tyranny of Aamon - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IR0akUawX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer, may just be the most teasing of teaser trailers I’ve seen for a while, and other than some moody visuals and a disturbing laugh, there’s not all that much to go on. There definitely will be a dark new region, weeks of in-game events, Twitch Drops, and exclusive giveaways — including gaming PCs worth €2,400 so that seems well worth checking out.</p>
<p>The free expansion will introduce the mysterious Moonshadow Vale — a new region filled with dangerous dungeons, powerful bosses, and unique gear to craft.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release, players can take part in a month-long pre-event phase starting October 8, 2025, featuring exclusive missions, community activities, Twitch Drops, and massive prize raffles with rewards ranging from valuable in-game items to premium merchandise — and even two state-of-the-art gaming PCs valued at €2,400 each. Visit the Tyranny of Aamon promo page for more information.</p>

<p>“For almost two decades, Metin2 has inspired millions of players worldwide. With Tyranny of Aamon, we are opening a new chapter that challenges long-standing veterans while also making it easier for new players to join. This update exemplifies our philosophy of continuously evolving established games while also introducing fresh challenges along with new content,” said Patrick Mathieu, Senior Product Manager at Gameforge.</p>
<p>Highlights of Tyranny of Aamon will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moonshadow Vale as a new zone – A mysterious landscape full of dangers and diverse quests.</li>
<li>Dark dungeons &amp; fearsome foes – The sinister Aamon serves as the central antagonist, but many other dangerous creatures lurk within the new dungeons.</li>
<li>New items – Weapons, boots, and other valuable rewards await victorious heroes.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Nobody really wants to see games delayed, especially when you’re looking forward to them, but equally, no one wants to play something that isn’t quite at its best. The development team for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, have made that difficult decision, though seemingly not to spend more time tweaking and improving (though I’m sure they are) but rather to avoid the holidy release melee that we’re currently in the midst of. Moonlight 2: The Endless Vault’s new release date will be November 19th, where it will launch into Early Access on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Behind the Counter Ep.3 - The Art of Moonlighter 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3GCa-ZiTv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is coming from Digital Sun and 11-Bit Games, and is the direct sequel to the original Moonlighter, a game that mixed some lovely shopkeeping mechanics by day with a little moonlighting as a hero spelunking through dungeons at night. It stands as one of the absolute best indie games of recent years, so we can totally forgive the team for holding onto the sequel for just a little longer, particularly so it can breathe a little easier with fewer big releases around it.</p>
<p>The team at Digital Sun released a statement, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While our original plan was set for October 23, the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’ve decided to&nbsp;<strong>move our release to November 19</strong>.</p>

<p>While we understand extending the wait isn’t the best news, we have a small treat for you! We plan to run Closed Playtests on Steam and via the Microsoft Store, allowing you to test some of the changes we have implemented in the game based on your feedback.&nbsp; You can expect more details on that very soon!</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Consider it a little extra time to sharpen your swords, restock your shelves, and prepare for the adventures ahead.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Publisher 11-Bit Studios may have contributed in some part to the delay themselves, with the console release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> recently hitting shelves, and proving to be the perfect timesink while players wait for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault to arrive.</p>
