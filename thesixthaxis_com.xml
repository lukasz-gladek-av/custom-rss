		<p>Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have confirmed that the twisted card game Sultan’s Game will be released on March 31st for PC via Steam. Sultan’s Game has the label of being a twisted narrative card game because you, as his advisor, have to complete different acts within a week or suffer the consquences of failure.</p>

<p><em>“Sultan’s Game&nbsp;is finally launching soon and we appreciate the overwhelming support from the community along the way,”</em> said Yin Li, Producer and Developer, Double Cross Studio. <em>“Both long-time supporters and newcomers will be able to immerse themselves in the Sultan’s turbulent world soon; stay tuned for the upcoming new information!”</em></p>
<p>Every seven days in Sultan’s Game players draw one of four card types; Carnality, Extravagance, Conquer, and Bloodshed. Carnality cards instruct players to seek pleasures of the body like sex, Extravagance instructs players to spend obscene amounts without a care, Conquer sends players on adventures to complete, and Bloodshed demands a blood sacrifice to please the Sultan. To complete these demands, players will be navigating court politics, the back alleys of the city, and wandering into brothels. Every decision made will have an impact on relationships with other people in your life from political rivals, allies, and family members. The various paths will lead to a variety of different endings, with decisions allowing you to try and control the Sultan, to outright killing him.</p>

<p>There is a demo available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/">Sultan’s Game on Steam</a> right now.</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced it is acquiring the Australian based game developer Video Games Deluxe, though it has not disclosed the fee. Video Games Deluxe has been a long time partner studio of Rockstar Games, having worked on the re-release of LA Noire and LA Noire: The VR Files, along with updating Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Going forward, the name Video Games Deluxe will be dropped and the studio renamed to Rockstar Australia.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,</em>” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe in a statement.</p>
<p><em>“It’s been an honor to work closely with&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;this past decade,”</em> said Video Games Deluxe founder&nbsp;Brendan McNamara. <em>“We are thrilled to be a part of&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe was born out of the ashes of Team Bondi, developer of LA Noire, and was founded by Brendan McNamara. We do not know what this means going forward. It could be that Rockstar Australia will support with content and updates for Grand Theft Auto VI, or it could be a signal of intent by Rockstar to have another studio out there that can create more games.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 is currently slated for a release in 2025</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, with the reveal trailer that arrived back in December 2023 confirming the game is taking us back to Vice City, and introducing us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist.</p>
