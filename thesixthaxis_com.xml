		<p>2026 is already proving to be another great year for game releases, within the context of long-awaited games being pushed back or cancelled altogether – I’m very sad we’re not getting a Sands of Time remaster, especially when it was seemingly more or less finished. Still, maybe Ubisoft were saving us from ruining our memory of the original. I’ve had plenty of fun this week, continuing to dabble in Highguard, though I can feel the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-with-new-story-focus-and-new-characters-including-a-flying-cat-healer/">soon-to-be numberless Overwatch</a> pulling me back with all of the new announcements coming out from Blizzard. Besides that, I’m working on a Monster Hunter Stories 3 preview and a Switch 2 Citadelum review, which may have just totally sold me on the mouse controls on Nintendo’s latest console.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has played a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/02/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-review/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>. He says, “It’s a really good game, thoroughly recommend! In other news, I checked out the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/06/bafta-games-in-concert-opening-night-in-review/">BAFTA Games in Concert</a> at the weekend. It was good, and worth checking out if it comes to an arena near you!”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/nioh-3-review/">played lots of Nioh 3</a>. So much so, that he could only manage to say, “Game good!”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued with Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “40 hours in and I’ve only just landed on the last planet to explore. I’m really enjoying the vibe of the game, getting on my speeder and seeing what’s out there.”</p>
<p>Having watched the credits roll on Hellblade II, <strong>Jim</strong> came away from it with mixed feelings. He told us, “Some truly incredible visual set pieces and character building, though the puzzles felt very rehashed and unimaginative even if they look pretty cool. I also played some more Deadlock, which scratches two itches as I’ve been hankering for both a solid hero shooter and a MOBA, even though I don’t have the free time to fully commit to either.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> finally defeated the ram spirit boss in Spirit of the North 2! She said, “I’m just happy it only took me about 30 attempts opposed to some people online who claimed they were at it for months!! Now my fox can go play in the snow in the Frigid Peaks region I love how perturbed the fox looks when it slides down the ice tunnels.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing three game for review, Romeo is A Dead Man, Aces of Thunder, and Icarus. That’s not all though! He said, “I’ve also fit a few goes of Halls of Torment in as well, and a couple hours of Factorio before I had to stop because it threatened to take over all my time.”</p>
<p>Also busy with reviews, <strong>Ade</strong> gave us a whistle-stop rundown of what he played: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/speedball-review/">Speedball</a> (fun but limited), Dispatch – Switch Edition (great if you love black rectangles!), and Aerial Knight’s Dropshot (can’t say, embargoed).</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing so much Romeo is a Dead Man and so much Code Vein II! Meanwhile, Tuffcub actually turned on his PS5 for the first time in weeks and played Highguard and&nbsp; – shock! Horror! – Destiny 2. He’s also starting off with Reanimal too.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing some underwhelming indie horror games that have not scratched the itch before Resident Evil Requiem with The 9th Charnel being the latest. He continued, “I also finished my bedtime Gigasword adventures and absolutely loved my time with it even if it weirdly got easier as it went along. I followed that up with a procedurally generated Metroidvania for review next week and finally a game that I cannot reveal.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been revving his two-stroke, as it were, in Ride 6 for review. He also ran through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-both-show-what-the-switch-2-is-capable-of/">the Pragmata demo</a> on Switch 2 once again, finishing it in around 11 minutes. Can you do better?</p>
<p>What about you? Played anything good?</p>
