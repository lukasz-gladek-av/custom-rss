<p>Scott Pilgrim EX takes us back to Toronto with the city having been taken over by three gangs, with those being The Vegans, The Robots, and The Demons. Oh, and members of the Sex Bob-omb have been kidnapped too. At its heart, Scott Pilgrim EX is a brawler with each character having their own abilities, which can be upgraded, and the game supports four player co-op.</p>

<p>In our Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game – Complete Edition review, Reuben said, <em>“Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition remains an excellent game. With the whole game and DLC bundled together, this is the definitive package for fans of the franchise and of beat ’em ups in general. There’s a lot to be in lesbians with here, from the stellar soundtrack to excellent moment to moment gameplay. It’s clearly an utterly unique labour of love from a talented group of people (who happen to work at Ubisoft).”</em></p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim EX will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Switch.</p>
