		<p>Hiroyuki Kotani, the producer behind PATAPON, has partnered with Tokyo Virtual Theory to announce RATATAN. RATATAN is a rhythmic roguelike where players use instruments and the rhythmical beat of the music to fight enemies. It has been confirmed to coming out in 2025, and will be releasing on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Switch.</p>

<p>RATATAN’s roguelike element comes from the fact that after each battle players are rewarded with different power ups and awards, with these changing on each run. These power ups and rewards are given to the little Cobuns who accompany the Ratatan, which can be used in the various trials and battles they will face. The Ratatan have their own unique abilities too which will require players to switch between them to tackle different puzzles.</p>
<p>Game Source Entertainment, a Hong Kong based publisher, will be publishing RATATAN.</p>

<li>With the Episodes and Lost Coast now contained within Half-Life 2 itself, we’ll be reducing the visibility of the standalone versions on the Steam Store. The old standalone applications will remain available to ensure community projects that rely on them still function properly but they will now appear within the Tools menu on your Steam Library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Valve has also announced that it will be reprinting Raising The Bar, an expanded edition of the original book that was first printed in 2004. This second edition of Raising The Bar adds new concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, plus a look at the never released third episode. It will be released in 2025.</p>

		<p>The tail end of every year is full of single days that are blown way out of proportion. Halloween has houses covered in cobwebs and guarded by pumpkins for weeks before and after, Christmas has a two month run up (if not longer), and even Thanksgiving in the US has morphed into a scattershot ‘Friendsgiving’ gathering ahead or instead of the actual holiday.</p>
<p>But we all know what comes directly after Thanksgiving, and that’s Black Friday, and the need to ring up sales has Black Friday sales kicking off all over the place already – it’s the Friday with by far the biggest presence on the calendar. I’ll admit, I’ve got my eye out for a few choice purchases as gifts, biding my time until the best deals arrive…</p>

<p>It was a good time in the reviews column, with two classic game series getting two excellent, but very different new game releases in recent times.
