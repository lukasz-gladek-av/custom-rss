		<p>Ubisoft have revealed, via the unusual method of pictogram, that three old Far Cry games will be getting an update to 60 frames per second. The games are Far Cry 3, Far Cry Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal, but there is no date or format information for updates.</p>



<p>Excellent use of a cat purring emoji there, Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Far Cry 5 was updated to run at 60fps <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/16/far-cry-5-free-60fps-upgrade-free-weekend/">in 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-6/">Far Cry 6</a> launched with a 60fps mode.</p>
<p>In 2023 it was rumoured that Far Cry 7 was to be two games, Project Blackbird which is Far Cry 7, and also Project Maverick, a new stand alone multiplayer game which may be linked to Far Cry 7.</p>

<p>Ubisoft are very fond of massive multiplayer live service games that they can run for many years with content update so it makes sense they would try and make a Far Cry multiplayer title. Sources have also revealed that the game will use the Frostbite engine rather than the aging Dunia engine. Again, this makes sense, one engine for all of Ubisoft’s games means less money spent on maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Far Cry 7 is said to be set in the “Alaskan wilderness” and is an extraction-based shooter” with mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more.”</p>
<p>In September 2025 Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot gave a presentation at the New Global Sport Conference and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/far-cry-7-will-focus-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-confirms/">said</a> that the goal with Far Cry 7 is to “really to bring the multiplayer aspects” and that it would be “more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time.”</p>
<p>Far Cry was one of three games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">folded in to a brand new compan</a>y along with Assassin’s Creed and Rainbow Six. The business unit is the new home for Ubisoft’s teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. The new subsidiary will control each game from these series in the back catalogue, as well as any new games that are in development going forward.</p>
