		<p>Bungie have just dropped a bombshell as, following the recent Star Wars cosmetic DLC, the upcoming Renegades expansion is going to be based – somehow – on Star Wars, Check out the teaser trailer!</p>

<p>The Bungie logo is now animated in the same way as the Star Wars logo, there are familiar sights and sounds and if that wasn’t enough to confirm the Star Wars theme, it’s got a Lucasfilm copyright at the end. Quite how they are going to merge the to universes is unclear but this is going to be a lot more than just cosmetic DLC.</p>
<p>A full reveal of Renegades will happen on September 29th 2025, with the expansion launching in December.</p>

		<p>The next chapter for Destiny 2 has been revealed by Bungie along with details of the upcoming year.&nbsp; A new trailer shows The Emissary, who is a friend of Drifter,&nbsp; being lectured to by The Nine and eventually transformed into a cybernetic body.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Without writing a million pages of Lore, The Nine are extra-dimensional beings that existed before The Traveller, before Ghosts and essentially before Destiny started. They have been mainly background characters during the first chapter of the game, but it seems they are going to be the new bad guys in The Fate Saga, which is going to be running over multiple years. They are individual characters, they are not a collective, so that would give the game plenty of new end of chapter bad guys to fight.</p>
<p>A gameplay trailer for The Edge of Fate was released that shows new weapons, new expansions and new powers. It begins with an invitation to a moment in time “for a very specific” reason,&nbsp; and you will be heading to Kepler, a tiny planet in the Oort cloud on the edge of our Solar System. We are also told that parts of Earth’s past have been pulled in to Kepler, which explains the subway trains and could be the rumoured level based on Chicago.</p>

<p>The new expansion will have ‘World Tiers’ with varying difficulty levels, with puzzles and events changing depending on the level. There’s also a new ability called “Matterspark” that allows you to turn in to Sonic the Hedgehog, or at least the Destiny 2 version, which is a sparkling ball of death.&nbsp; Matterspark is powered by Dark Matter (which is what The Nine are made of) and lucky for us there’s completely made-up thingy that allows everyone to see it.</p>

<p>The Edge of Fate launches on July 15th, with Renegades launching in Winter, followed by Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist in 2026, but before that we have The Right of the Nine, a free prologue event that reuses some dungeons but with a new twist.</p>
