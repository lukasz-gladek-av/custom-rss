<p><em>“The&nbsp;Reinforcements&nbsp;DLC isn’t just about adding bigger ships—it’s about giving players entirely new ways to think about victory,”</em> said Brian Clair, Executive Producer at Stardock. <em>“From unleashing faction-defining command ships to achieving lore-driven win conditions, every match can now end in a way that feels true to your chosen empire.”</em></p>
<p>So, what are the unique ships and victory conditions? Here is a handy list of them all.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Vasari Alliance – Sularkon Tyrant:</strong>&nbsp;A city-ship fortress with integrated Phase Gate, designed to lock down entire sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Vasari Exodus – Anarkrul Wanderer:</strong>&nbsp;A colossal refugee-carrier turned warship, bristling with defenses and heavy strikecraft support.</li>
<li><strong>Advent Wrath – Oblivia Dreadnought:</strong>&nbsp;A heavily armored frontline warship wielding a devastating Super Heavy PsiKinetic Lance.</li>
<li><strong>Advent Reborn – Justicia Dreadnought:</strong>&nbsp;A vertical dreadnought that grows deadlier as allies fall, culminating in catastrophic retaliation.</li>
