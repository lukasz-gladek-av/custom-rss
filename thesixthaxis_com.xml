		<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios have settled on a release date for their co-op horror platformer, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>, settling on Friday, 13th February 2026.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the creators of Little Nightmares I &amp; II, and it sticks with their particular penchant for dark and unsettling imagery and creatures tormenting small people. In this game a brother and sister have to try and go through this hell to rescue missing friends and escape an island they once called home.</p>


<p>Pre-orders are now open across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and today also sees the release of a demo for the game on consoles (already available on PC) for fans to try out. The co-op demo starts at the beginning of the game, reuniting the protagonists and presenting you early environments at the Mill and the Trainyard to play through.</p>
<p>The demo is also coming to Switch 2 at a later date, and pre-orders for Nintendo’s handheld will be on hold until then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One week on from the big content update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, adding the new Stella Montis map and more to the game, Embark Studios has released the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, focussing on bug fixes, balance changes, and with a little surprise for good measure.</p>
<p>There’s a few nerfs here, which Embark will need to be rather cautious in leaning on too heavily, as demonstrated by many previous multiplayer games. From the PvP angle, the Venator has been chewing through other players at close range, so its fire rate upgrades have been dropped significantly. Meanwhile, PvE focused players will be disappointed by the explosive damage nerf, which Embark felt was hitting too many parts of larger enemies and making things like the Hullcracker too effective – which you’d want it to be, given how awesome that name is.</p>


<p>Beyond that, it’s mainly bug fixes – stopping ARCs from going outside of maps, fixing a few crashes, and the like.</p>
<p>here’s the full ARC Raiders 1.3.0 patch notes:</p>

<p><b>Venator</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note: </b>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Explosive Damage</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note:</b> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<hr>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder<wbr>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.<wbr></li>

</li>
<li><b>Blue Gate</b><wbr>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Stella Montis</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.<wbr></li>

<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.<wbr></li>
<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.<wbr></li>

</ul>
</li>
