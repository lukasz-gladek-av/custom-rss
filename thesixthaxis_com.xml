		<p>Imagine the world 10,000 years from now. Depending on your own perspective it could range from a place filled with futuristic cities with space travel being the norm, while for others you may imagine that humanity has been wiped out. Well, Kentum is for those of you who thought the latter as this is a world where you play as Kent, the last human alive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kentum - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUalylbx8PQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Kentum, Kent wakes up from a 7000 year nap to discover that he is in the year 10,000 and that he is alone aside from his robot companion. Kent is not one to sit around and mope though, as he goes out to gather resources and build a base to live in. The world is a dangerous place filled with creatures and dangers within the environment. Scanning and collecting resources including from animals, plants, and minerals is key to survival to create items that helps Kent survive. Or not. Luckily, Kent gets cloned every time he dies so death is a bit of a nuisance and nothing more. The full features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive… or Not! You’ll Be Cloned Anyways:&nbsp;</strong>Even though Kent will be revived endlessly, that doesn’t change the fact that dying is a major drag. You’ll need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes, and polish your cooking skills. Building your own farms and vivariums is your ticket to a steady source of nourishment.</li>
<li><strong>Explore, Scan, and Catalogue:&nbsp;</strong>Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with fascinating flora, fauna, and climate events. Classify every animal, plant, and mineral in order to help you survive the passing seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Craft it to the Limit:&nbsp;</strong>Use every material at your disposal to build your base. Start small by turning bone and wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal, and slowly but surely grow your base into a full-blown resource-generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Home Base of Your Dreams:&nbsp;</strong>Expand your home base and create an automated system to allow you to streamline and optimize your productions while you are off exploring.</li>
<li><strong>Traverse Exotic Locales in Style:&nbsp;</strong>From vibrant jungles to desolate ruins, traverse post-apocalyptic Earth with your hoverboard, hang glider, grappling hook and more. It is up to you to maneuver with equal parts adventure and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentum launches on November 6th for PC, Xbox Series XS, PS5 and Switch.</p>

		<p>Green Flamingo Games has announced a brand new 3D rhythm platformer called Spanky’s Battle Swing, and it takes inspiration from the cartoons of the 1930’s blending them with a soundtrack filled with electro swing jazz. The teaser trailer gives a glimpse at the platforming action, as well as a taster of the soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Spanky's Battle Swing | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PN3kuYjpYB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Spanky’s Battle Swing you play as Spanky The Bat as he navigates around the city of Metronopolis, a place where everything moves to the music. Spanky is not a fan of the constant noise and the way the city functions because of the music, so he is on a quest to shut it all up by getting to Mayor Metrognome. There are different districts in Metronopolis which each have their own music beats, tricks and guardians to take down. The key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhythm-Driven Platforming:</strong>&nbsp;Every foe, platform, and hazard moves to the beat—learn the pattern, bend the pattern,&nbsp;<strong>own</strong>&nbsp;the pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Electro-Swing Soundtrack:</strong>&nbsp;A punchy, dynamic score that keeps the city buzzing and your feet tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Vintage Cartoon Flair:</strong>&nbsp;A lively, personality-packed world with expressive characters and a 1930s-inspired look.</li>
<li><strong>Rebel Against the Beat:</strong>&nbsp;As Spanky, you can sync up… or go off-grid. Break timing rules to create your own openings and shut the city up—your way.</li>
</ul>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Spanky’s Battle Swing, but it will be coming out in 2026 for PC.</p>
