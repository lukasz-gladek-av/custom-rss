		<p>During Future Games Show LATAM, Run Games announced and shadow dropped a new free to play multiplayer football game called Football Heroes League. It seems to be inspired by Rocket League but with actual football instead of cars. We have essentially come full circle and can dub this Rocket League with people.</p>

<p>In Football Heroes League, you can compete in 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 matches to score the most goals and win. There is also a training mode to get to grips with the controls, and an instant replay system will be added soon. Players can currently choose from a roster of five heroes, with more to be added during the game’s early access phase. The five heroes available at the moment are Kenzo, Beckers, Leo, Frostine, and Bun-E, and each of them has a special ability. Kenzo has jet boots to give him super speed, Beckers has mag boots to control the ball direction so she can in theory bend it like Beckham, Leo has the strength to get passed opponents, Frostine is able to freeze opponents, and Bun-E commands BunBots that can be used to assist in defence and attack. I bet VAR wouldn’t be able to cope with all of these shenanigans.</p>

		<p>Developer Killasoft has revealed The Shadow Syndicate which has been described as a stealth action game set in 1930’s Brooklyn. You can check out the reveal trailer below from Future Games Show LATAM, with the footage giving a look at some gameplay and the noir kind of feel that you would expect from a detective game set in the 1930s.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Shadow Syndicate - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcxW7qOesd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Shadow Syndicate’s description says,<em> “The Shadow Syndicate is a narrative-driven stealth-action game set in a stylized 1930s Brooklyn. Step into the shoes of Sam Marlowe, a retired soldier turned private detective, as he unravels a city-wide conspiracy involving secret societies, occult forces, and a creeping darkness threatening to consume it all. Sneak, fight, and investigate through a rich cinematic experience blending noir storytelling with supernatural abilities and fast-paced action. Use your cursed Sacrifice Ring to unleash powerful skills—at a cost. Explore a living open city between missions, filled with colorful characters, mini-games, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.”</em></p>
<p>The gameplay will consist of investigating areas for clues, solving puzzles in your notebook, interrogating characters for information, and getting into gunfights. The combat will feature bullet time as well as supernatural abilities that will let Sam stun enemies, teleport, or instantly kill enemies. However, using these abilities builds up a deadly curse that will have consequences for Sam. Outside of the main story you take on side quests or you can go around Brooklyn to go bowling, play darts, or play blackjack.</p>

<p>A release date for The Shadow Syndicate is yet to be confirmed but it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>
