		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> Patch 8.0 arriving last week, adding <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/space-marine-2-endless-siege-mode-is-coming-in-junes-free-update/">the big new Siege Mode to the game</a>, Saber Interactive has now teased a little of what they have planned for the game’s anniversary. Update 10.0 will arrive in September, and it’s planned as “a large-scale update”, heralding the start of a second year of both free and paid DLC content.</p>
<p>But first some bad news. With the scope of what the 10.0 update will bring, Saber has decided that Update 9.0 will only bring balancing changes and no new content, so the new PvP mode that was planned for 9.0 has been postponed and rolled into 10.0 as well.</p>


<p>This new game mode (while they won’t go into specifics) will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new mode-specific map</li>
<li>Chaos vs. Chaos PvP</li>
<li>Playable controlled Helbrutes</li>
</ul>
<p>With how Chaos-centric this new mode is, new Chaos armours will be added to the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new melee weapon: the Power Axe. This will have new moves, execution animations and more.</p>


<p>And finally, a new class is being introduced for both PvE and PvP in the form of the Techmarine. More details on this class will come in the next community update post.</p>
<p>With the arrival of update 10.0, Space Marine 2 will be heading into its second year, and given the huge success of the game, Saber is committing to a second year of both free and DLC content – this means there will be a new yearly season pass for those who need more Space Marine customisation options. The core of the content will be freely available to all, though, and so we can expect to see more new&nbsp;PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and even more beyond that.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has released brand new mission content for Red Dead Online with this pack of content called Strange Tales of the West. Now, according to the trailer this is volume one of Strange Tales of the West. We get a small glimpse of what to expect in Red Dead Online’s new content and you can take a gander yourself right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pcg9NVGMxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer for Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West you will come up against zombies, alligators, a cult that worships a blood red sun, and robots that look a bit like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. Full details of each mission can be read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Tales of the Plague – There are stories of a malady spreading among the people of Armadillo, turning them into shambling undead. It’ll fall on you to retrieve several of these diseased corpses for scientific examination, if you can avoid infection and fend off attacks from a resurgent cell of nearby cultists.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of Modern Science – A nearby man of science claims he’s created artificial life that stalks the grounds of Braithwaite Manor, killing those curious or unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Bring the strange experiment to light by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Bayou – Something unholy lurks in the swamps of Lagras. Explore at your own risk, be wary of ambushes by Swamp Folk who call those wetlands home, and bring the swamp creature back for Theodore.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Wilderness – Investigate reports of a missing scientist last seen conducting strange research on a crew of murderers in Tall Trees. When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the Strange Tales of the West content in Red Dead Online you can visit any post office or your camp lockbox and picking up four telegrams from Theodore Levin. On completion of each mission you will get triple gold, RDO$, and experience points up until August 4th.</p>

<p>The release of this new content for Red Dead Online is a surprise as in 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/08/red-dead-online-support-cut-back-as-rockstar-focuses-on-gta6/">Red Dead Online support was cut back as Rockstar moved focus to GTA 6.&nbsp;</a>The sign that support is once again up and running for Red Dead Online would suggest there is a dedicated team working on Red Dead again, and it may even point to more Red Dead news in the future.</p>
