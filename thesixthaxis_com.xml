		<p>Tides of Annihilation was another new game announced during the State of Play, and it is an action title set in a ruined London. In this reality, London was destroyed by an invasion originating from another world, taking out everyone except main character Gwendolyn. She is on a mission to find and save her family, using the power of spectral knights to take on foes.</p>

<p>In Tides of Annihilation, the spectral knights and enemies are all based off of Arthurian mythology. Each of the ten knights have their own unique powers that Gwendolyn can use to in her battles. London will also undergo changes as you explore, switching between Medieval and modern timelines, looking for grail shards to figure out how this invasion occurred. As you wander, you will see Colossal Knights walking around too, and they are not just part scenery but an additional challenge to take on. Developer Eclipse Game Studio also confirmed that those with a PS5 Pro will have access to an exclusive Enhanced mode that adds <em>“higher resolution, ray tracing, improved image fidelity, and smoother 60fps gameplay.”</em></p>
<p>A release date for Tides of Annihilation is yet to be confirmed, but it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>Sony’s State of Play broadcast included a trailer for Metal Eden, a new sci-fi first person shooter which will be out on May 6th 2025. </p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Eden - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_nAwi4kQNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You play as an advanced battle android called a Hyper Unit which can dash, grapple and wall-run through levels dealing out damage with lots of big juicy weapons. As an extra twist you can also roll out, quite literally, by transforming into a massive metal ball and smashing into enemies. You have to battle through Moebius, a vast monolithic city high above the planet’s surface protecting the mysterious Hive Tower, and the world below, known as Vulcan. </p>
