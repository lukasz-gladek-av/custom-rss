		<p>If you’re looking for a cute, classic action-adventure, then going off the game’s demo, The Knightling should be high up on your list. Coming from developer Twirlbound, The Knightling sees you taking on the role of a rookie knight who, while waiting the return of his master Sir Lionstone, decides to try and do some good. Set in the realm of Clessia, which is bereft of a lead knight, it’s up to you to look after the populace. The only problem is that nobody takes you seriously because, well, you’re just a kid, and you don’t even have a sword. What kind of a knight doesn’t have a sword?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Steam Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjOWFtKNGV4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Knightling has definitely taken a leaf out of Captain America’s comic book though, and he’s equipped with a massive shield that’s as good at offense as it is for defence. There’s the expected throwing and bouncing off things that Steve Rogers loves, but the Knightling can also use his shield as a makeshift sledge, hopping inside it and sliding down from great heights.</p>


<p>Captain America’s shield also doesn’t talk to you, or have a name. Magnustego – Magnus for short – is a legendary magical shield who gives you tips and hints as you go along, or berates you for using him in an unshield-ly way, and he’s a constant companion through The Knightlings adventure. You can upgrade him along the way, increasing the strength of your attacks or adding new moves to your repertoire.</p>


<p>The Knightling is a cheery soul, if a little perturbed that no one thinks they’re going to be able to do much, at least here in the demo. He’s thoughtful though, and keen to help, ingratiating himself with the townsfolk by helping them out with small-scale issues. There’s definitely echoes of Ocarina of Time here, just in the cheerful, colourful do-gooding and the playful music that bops along in the background.</p>
<p>Combat is fast and cute, smashing monsters with your shield before unleashing a huge special attack when you’ve charged the gauge. Healing is performed by snacking on whatever food you’ve been able to nab, pulling up carrots from the ground being the first of these, restocking the healing gauge, which you can then use when you’re in need. It feels pretty generous – this is not a Soulslike – but there’s still danger lurking from the monsters that roam the land.</p>
<p>You earn praise for everything you do, including, it seems, jumping to the top of houses and high vantage points. If anyone has played the Crackdown series they’ll know how satisfying and strangely moreish this, so I’m hoping it’s something that continues to appear throughout, pushing you to climb and jump higher and higher. There are some pretty tricky platforming sections just in this early section, and I can see things ramping up as you progress further and further into the game’s open world.</p>

<p>I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity.</p>
<p>I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one, as it looks like it could be one of this year’s sleeper hits when it comes to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

		<p>Tides of Annihilation was another new game announced during the State of Play, and it is an action title set in a ruined London. In this reality, London was destroyed by an invasion originating from another world, taking out everyone except main character Gwendolyn. She is on a mission to find and save her family, using the power of spectral knights to take on foes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ3fDz_xCio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Tides of Annihilation, the spectral knights and enemies are all based off of Arthurian mythology. Each of the ten knights have their own unique powers that Gwendolyn can use to in her battles. London will also undergo changes as you explore, switching between Medieval and modern timelines, looking for grail shards to figure out how this invasion occurred. As you wander, you will see Colossal Knights walking around too, and they are not just part scenery but an additional challenge to take on. Developer Eclipse Game Studio also confirmed that those with a PS5 Pro will have access to an exclusive Enhanced mode that adds <em>“higher resolution, ray tracing, improved image fidelity, and smoother 60fps gameplay.”</em></p>
<p>A release date for Tides of Annihilation is yet to be confirmed, but it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
