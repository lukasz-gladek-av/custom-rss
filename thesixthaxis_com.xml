		<p>Acclaim has just finished its first showcase after the company was resurrected, having previously closed down in 2004. In today’s showcase, Acclaim has shown what games it has on the cards with lots of new IPs, with some of the announced games out today. So, what was announced. Keep reading to find out and get the details.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRIDbeat! – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TATp91aZGe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>GRIDbeat was the first game announced during the Acclaim showcase, and it is described as a rhythm based dungeon crawler. In the game, you are a hacker who has breached the Knoss.OS, a corporate network from which you have stolen some files. However, the system will not let you escape easily, so you have to navigate 50 levels while avoiding the various security protocols. Every move you make has to be in line with the beat of the music. As you make progress you will unlock software tools to assist with fending off the security threats, and be guided by your assistant Dot. A release date is yet to be confirmed for GRIDbeat, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">wishlist it.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Basketball Classics – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_CRBRrUClc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basketball Classics is not a new release but has been on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/">PC via Steam </a>since 2019. It is a pixel styled basketball game that spans decades and boasts thousands of players. As you can see from the trailer it is a simplified basketball game which includes a story mode, and you can unlock Legend characters for your teams too. It is currently on sale for £2.51, with the regular price being £7.19. Basketball Classics will be coming to consoles, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pixel Washer – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHk6rCKKkEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pixel Washer looks like a game where someone was a fan of PowerWash Simulator but wondered how the game would play if you were a pig. In Pixel Washer, that question is answered as you are a pig that loves to power wash everything. You start cleaning at home with your basic washer, but as you earn money you can unlock more powerful washers and take on the bigger jobs around town. There also seem to be a couple of twists, with the trailer showing the pig fighting or washing a dragon. This is not a newly announced game, with it first appearing on Steam in 2023 but Acclaim is now taking on publishing duties. A release date has not been set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tossdown – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgpOFBYTNKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tossdown is a package delivery game with chaos imbued within it. At least that is what the trailer is saying and showing. In Tossdown, you have to deliver packages on time while avoiding hazards like meteors, missiles, enemy gunmen, and a lot more. You can unlock powerups and perks to help fight back against the various dangers, and to assist you with making sure deliveries are made on time. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GROUND ZERO HERO – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6nmoH5bTTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ground Zero Hero is a survival action roguelite in which you fight off various mutants that stalk you across a post apocalyptic wasteland. The best way to fight these mutants is to become a mutant yourself, which gives you access to different abilities that help you take on the hordes. There are different wastelands to explore with their own enemies and mutations to unlock. It seems you can combine different mutations to create a very powerful super mutant. There is a demo coming for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570580/Ground_Zero_Hero/">Ground Zero Hero on Steam</a>, and a release date is yet to be set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Talaka – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiM8nJoUL_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Talaka is definitely one of the more interesting looking games to come out of the Acclaim showcase. The art style makes this action platformer roguelite look like a painting in motion. Talaka brings together Afro-Brazilian mythology, with some of the subjects of those myths out to kill Talaka. However, some of the Orisha gods are present to aid Talaka with blessings, but she will need to make choices that will affect the story and lead to branching narratives. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3815370/Talaka/">Talaka is available to wishlist on Steam</a> now. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hH9sIotgOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate may be one for those of you who played the SSX games, especially SSX Tricky. It looks like a stylised snowboarding racing game, and it will have three different modes. The first is Challenge Mode, in which you need to hit high scores by pulling off tricks, collect items, and complete objectives. Race Mode is self explanatory as you race against others to cross the finish line first. The final mode is Chill Mode where you can freely explore tracks and look for secrets. HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate will have multiplayer and it can be<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082730/HYPERyuki_Snowboard_Syndicate/"> wishlisted on Steam.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH07w3-bMv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest is a 2D platformer set in the mind of Fletcher. After a psychologist appointment goes wrong, Fletcher gets trapped in his own mind prison and needs to navigate it to escape. The game is a another roguelike metroidvania, so you will need to throughly explore all of the various secrets locked up in Fletcher’s mind to get him out of there. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725470/The_Prisoning_Fletchers_Quest/">The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest</a>, and a demo is on the way too.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katanaut – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAvYl2TOwPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The final game announced during Acclaim’s showcase was Katanaut. It is a very gory 2D action platformer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">it is out now on Steam</a> for the promotional price of £11.99. Katanaut is a roguelite set on a space station that has been overwhelmed by cosmic horrors. As you explore and slash your way through the hordes you can unlock new abilities and weapons to use across runs, with runs themselves differing as the pathways change around you.</p>
