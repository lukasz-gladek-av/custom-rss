		<p>PUBG Studios has announced that its PUBG spin off PUBG: Blindspot will be released into Early Access on February 5th. PUBG: Blindspot is a different experience to Battlegrounds, as this is a top down 5v5 tactical shooter within enclosed spaces instead of a bigger, open world. You can check out the gameplay in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5qFiL2pdWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PUBG: Blindspot trailer above shows two teams of five battling it out as one side defends while another attacks. Players can only see&nbsp; what is happening in their line of sight, so anything obscured by doors or walls is hidden from view. That is unless you decide to blow a wall up to try and get a jump on the opposition. The attacking team is trying to fight through the building to hack into the hidden Crypt, while the defending team is trying to stop the hack from happening. Players will have access to unique characters that have their own playstyles and weapon preferences, with those including assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, long-range weapons like sniper rifles and DMR, pistols, and grenade launchers.</p>
<p>As this will be an early access release the content and experience of PUBG: Blindspot will evolve as the development team tweak the game based on player feedback. A release date for the 1.0 version has not yet been set.</p>
