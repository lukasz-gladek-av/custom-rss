		<p>There seems to be a major movement towards bigger, bolder indie RPGs right now, that push the boundaries of what we should expect in the indie space. We’ve just had the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a>, and now Empyreal is heading towards launch on the 8th of May. The development team at Silent Games is keen to give players an early glimpse of the game, and to help them understand the world and some of the systems that they’ll encounter so they’ve dropped an all-new overview trailer with a heap of detail to dispense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>In the seven-minute Game Overview video, creative director Joseph Rogers delves into the game’s key mechanics and narrative. You can learn more about the stories waiting to be told, the myriad ways to build your character, and how the mysterious Cartograms will affect every journey into the belly of the Monolith.</p>
<p>Empyreal is described as a feature-rich action RPG where players explore an imposing Monolith and fight to survive against the guardians that lie within. Uncover a complex narrative combining mythology, philosophy, and transcendental revelations as you lead an Expedition further into the structure to discover the truth that lies at its core. There’s already a demo available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/">PC players via Steam</a>, so if you fancy checking it out early, you can!</p>

<p>The main features of the game are a unique and complex combat system, a memorable cast of characters, with personal questlines and multiple endings for each one. A beautiful but shattered ancient world, where you can explore breathtaking environments filled with hidden details. You can also customise your character with a vast array of equipment and collect armour sets that confer powerful bonuses, while upgrading and modifying the loot you find. Besides that you’ll ablso unlock new abilities to personalise your playstyle.</p>

<p>It definitely looks fantastic, and we can’t wait to show you more. Empyreal will release on 8 May for PC via Steam, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S. Empyreal is priced at £24.99/$29.99/€29.99, with a 10% launch discount on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/jdm-japanese-drift-master-drops-a-new-trailer-on-its-way-to-release-in-may/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a great time to be a driving game fan, with 2025 already hotting up with the arrival of games like Wreckfest 2 and Assetto Corsa Evo. Firmly on our upcoming radar is JDM: Japanese Drift Master, which might boast a Ronseal-styled name, but which is looking absolutely incredible, especially if you have any interest in the Japanese drift scene (watching Fast &amp; The Furious: Tokyo Drift doesn’t count, Initial D does).</p>
<p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | Eurobeat Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFOkWEiIhIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer shows off more of the drifting action as racers slide their way through neon-infused Japanese cities and towns through to the beautiful, traditional countryside. The team have used their own photos, as well as images lifted from Google Earth to truly capture the look and feel of the country, something that it looks as though they’ve absolutely done.</p>
<p>This new trailer features an exclusive Eurobeat song that’s been written for JDM: Japanese Drift Master. Called LIFESHIFTFIRE!, it’s an electrifying Eurobeat track composed by Kamil Hasselhoff, Naski, and Marga, and it made its international debut during the Future Games Show. Music looks to play an integral part in the game, and in keeping with the drift scene, it’ll bounce between Eurobeat, Dance and Nu-Metal while you’re trying to achieve drift supremacy.</p>


<p>There’s a fully featured story mode here, and you’ll play Polish driver Touma, a new entrant on the scene. It’s up to you to take him from a nobody to the drift master, and there’s a great bunch of licensed cars from manufacturers like Nissan and Mazda in which to do it. JDM looks like it should be fairly welcoming too, with a Simcade driving setup that will give you heaps of control, without being too exacting.</p>
<p>JDM: Japanese Drift Master is due to arrive on the 21st of May, and will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48?__cf_chl_tk=b5um8CjyirgFe0bmT1hc5EMp5tCkEheD_xZPmT01ybw-1742556033-1.0.1.1-H9l41dC590rpjYP0w1iB5coAWf3qRK_AtPiNvYL45T4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master">GOG</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

		<p>Still riding the highs of the success of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team has released a new dev diary to reveal more about their upcoming original horror game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Co-directors Jacek Zieba and Wojciech Piejko gave us a tour of this setting. Amongst the inspirations are games like Dead Space and the challenge of Dark Souls, while movies such as Twelve Monkeys also provide some similar tones. The unusual looking suit for the Traveller is intended to look a bit like a deep sea diver, the heavy plates and the large dome-like helmet in particular. You’ll need that armour to survive encounters with the Orphans, the twisted human forms of what is left of humanity from this time, delving into a bit of body horror.</p>
<p>There’s some small snippets of gameplay within the dev diary, but Bloober say that a broader gameplay reveal will likely be coming soon.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this year.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/fbc-firebreak-gameplay-reveals-a-new-supernatural-threat-sticky-notes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/fbc-firebreak-gameplay-reveals-a-new-supernatural-threat-sticky-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> will launch this summer for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, shared a healthy dose of gameplay and revealed one of the big supernatural dangers you’ll face in the game: Sticky Notes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jobs and Gameplay – FBC: Firebreak (Community First Look)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Oh sure, yellow sticky notes seem innocuous enough to you and me, their small size (often cut into cute shapes these days) and weak glue making them mildly useful, but in The Oldest House and with the Hiss still running rampant? Well, haunted sticky notes are a real problem. The gameplay reveal for FBC: Firebreak focuses on this Job, a crisis-filled mission that will take you to the Executive Sector of the Federal Bureau of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. This mission, titled Paper Chase, is just one of many to take on in the game, with the sole objective to destroy as many sticky notes as possible. Other missions might have you try to find mannequin ski instructors and load them onto a paranatural ski lift…</p>
<p>With three-player PvE co-op at its heart, you’ll have three saved loadouts to choose from, Crisis Kits, which are themed around a particular tool and playstyle. You’ll then pick the Threat Level and Clearance Level of a Job, determining the difficulty of enemies and then the complexity and length of the mission.</p>
<p>The trailer and dev diary both show plenty of what you’ll expect to face. There’s regular Hiss zombie-type enemies, bomb squad Hiss with much heavier armour, and then humanoid forms constructed entirely of sticky notes. There’s even a giant Sandman-like boss to battle. One thing you’ll have to be wary of is getting covered with sticky notes yourself, with allies able to wash you down or showers dotted around the world to do the same – albeit at the cost of slowing you down for a bit from the cold water, unless you fix the heaters for the showers.</p>

<p>In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.&nbsp;There’s plenty of Left 4 Dead vibes to the action here, with safe rooms helping to provide some structure to the levels, and the need to defend from alerted enemies.</p>
<p>Remedy has already confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be available day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, PC Game Pass, PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium. In addition to this, they’ve now confirmed that all playable content will be available to all players for free, meaning any new levels will be playable for all. There’s no word on monetisation outside of that, but Remedy will share those details another time.</p>
