			<p>Surreal, surprising, and a bit silly are the best ways to describe Keeper, but with this being a game from Double Fine none of that is unexpected. Keeper is narrative puzzle experience, casting you as a lighthouse exploring a world that is in the grip of The Wither, accompanied by your bird friend Twig who is trying to get back to their family. None of this overtly explained, as there is no dialogue in Keeper with Double Fine trusting you to put some of the pieces together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Keeper starts off with your little lighthouse coming to life and growing legs. It is like a newborn creature and in the first moments you will fall over a lot while working out how to walk – though this is far from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/baby-steps-review/">a Baby Steps situation</a>. Soon, your feet are found and you start walking along the path with only one real goal, and that is to get to the top of the mountain.</p>


<p>Climbing a mountain is tough in the best of times when you’re a creature that has evolved to be very good at walking, so doing it as a lighthouse in a world that has lots of obstacles in the way sounds tricky. However, the way Keeper is laid out means the experience is hardly ever frustrating through its six hour runtime, though there is minor annoyance with some of the movement and the lack of ability to control the camera through more open areas. Sometimes, aiming your light can be a bit fiddly too.</p>


<p>Puzzles in Keeper start off very small. Your lighthouse can shine its light and focus it to highlight points of interest, interact with items, and clear paths. Where switches and levers need to be moved, Twig comes into play to move these switches to open doors and reveal more paths for you to follow. The more you venture into the world the bigger the puzzles get, with later ones using whole environments that hold the keys to passing. At no point does a puzzle get too hard, with many designed to kind of funnel you to the solution so you do not get stuck, but I do wish that there was something a little bit more mentally taxing.</p>
<p>That said, solving the puzzles in these areas is not all you should be focusing on. Among the different environments are little hidden areas with broken statues. With your light, these statues can be pieced back together, and you will unlock an achievement for each one. Double Fine has used the achievements system to expand Keeper’s lore, so you can learn more about what happened to the world.</p>

<p>Keeper looks fantastic throughout, with loads of variations in environments which feeds into how you play the game, constantly throwing up unexpected twists to the gameplay which keeps it fresh. The environments are really well detailed with lots of bright and colourful areas, juxtaposed with darker areas that reflect the mood of the story. My advice is take your time in each area, shine your light on the plants and inhabitants to watch them react and help the world bloom. I spent quite a bit of time in each place just shining the light on different things to see what would happen.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Keeper captures the essence of Double Fine, packaged in a heartfelt and surreal world where you never quite know what will happen next. The gameplay regularly surprises, but the lack of challenge in even the more elaborate puzzles is a bit of a drawback, along with not being able to control the camera.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-horizon-movie-could-be-out-in-2027.1327795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A The Horizon TV show was revealed by Sony in an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/27/gran-turismo-god-of-war-and-horizon-tv-shows-announced-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor briefing </a>in April 2022 and later on it was revealed that the show would be heading to Netflix. However,&nbsp; Steve Blackman, the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy and the Horizon series, was accused of “toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behaviour”, claims that he denied, and the Horizon series was cancelled.</p>
<p>In January this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Sony announced that a movie based</a> on the franchise was in the works at Columbia, the studio that made the Uncharted and Gran Turismo movies</p>


<p>Thanks to documents released as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">Sony’s ongoing battle with Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, we now know that a Horizon movie is moving forward and could be on the big screens by 2027.&nbsp; The document reveals that Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions has stated that they already have a script and are looking for a director, with filming taking place next year.</p>
<p>A Horizon television show always seemed implausible as almost everything would have to be CGI, including the many robot creatures, and that would be very expensive. A movie will have a bigger budget and can focus on a smaller part of the Horizon mythology.&nbsp; Personally, I would like a story set right at the start of the mythology as the human race races to save itself, but ultimately becomes food for the self-replicating robots they created.</p>
<p>Sony also has a Helldivers movie on the cards, but no details have been revealed for that project.&nbsp; A sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced in 2024 and in December of that year producer Charles Roven said that a script was in place.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be the rather busy Tom Holland who spent this year filming Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey and is currently zipping around in spandex filming Spider-Man: Brand New Day.&nbsp; After that, he’s got American Speed on schedule, will Uncharted film after that?</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it has, for the first time, signed a deal with football’s governing body FIFA, and this will have an impact on international management in Football Manager 26 and beyond. This includes adding the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women’s World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to the game at a later date as part of a international management content update due next year.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, <em>“Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio.Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we’re delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”</em></p>


<p>This partnership means in Football Manager 26 all of the teams taking part in the 2026 World Cup will have their official kits in the game. Further details are to follow at a later date about what else this partnership and the international management update will bring when it launches in 2026. Football Manager 26 is due to release on November 4th.</p>
