		<p>Developer Troglobytes Games and publisher Digital Vortex Entertainment have confirmed that the Lovecraftian inspired survival action game RailGods of Hysterra will be available through Steam Early Access on April 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="RailGods of Hysterra - Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlUQj4xMS3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We at Troglobytes are thrilled to invite all players to get on board the RailGod and wander through the Lovecraftian world we crafted with so much love and passion! See you all in Hysterra, and remember: Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!”</em> said Saverio Caporusso, CEO and Lead Designer at Troglobytes Games.</p>
<p><em>“To fans of cosmic horror, survival games, and those who just love trains, we’re happy to shout ‘ALL ABOARD!’”</em> said Digital Vortex CEO and Co-Founder Alex Izotov. <em>“This is an adventure we’ve been working on for a long time, and your feedback will be instrumental in shaping RailGods of Hysterra into its final form.”</em></p>
<p>In RailGods of Hysterra players can ride the train, which is infused with a RailGod, solo or team up in groups of four as you explore a world in which the Old Gods have conquered. The train can be customised by adding additional cars that can be used as storage facilities and workbenches. As you venture into this nightmare world you will face monsters and cultists that you beat in battle, or capture them to feed to the RailGod. This is a twisted world after all and the RailGod wants something in return for acting as your transport.</p>

<p>After RailGods of Hysterra releases on Steam Early Access it will eventually make its way to PS5, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
