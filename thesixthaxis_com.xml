			<p>In the annals of mascot platformers, Gex goes largely forgotten. Behind the colossi of Mario, Sonic and even the second string of Crash and Spyro, the lecherous gecko ends up alongside the likes of Bubsy the Bob Cat in prestige. Unlike that feline protagonist, however, Gex has starred in some decent games. The relatively long-awaited Limited Run collection of the Gex Trilogy is the perfect way to try these titles on modern consoles. That being said, this is very much a time capsule of the late 90s context of the games with all that entails – good and bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gex Trilogy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7voeA0cKjB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before going on to look at each of the three games individually, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the package as a whole. Limited Run are at pains to state that this is not a remake or remaster but instead uses their own Carbon Engine to present fully authentic versions of each game, albeit with quality of life improvements such as widescreen and analogue controls for 2 and 3. Saving is also improved, but does need to be done manually so make sure you don’t rely on the modern convenience of autosave. These are welcome improvements, but the end result is more like emulation than anything more involved and this has garnered some negative responses from buyers and fans. I knew this was the case going in and so am judging the collection based on what it is rather than any great Gexpectations. That being said, the lack of the Game Boy and N64 versions being included in the bundle is disappointing when compared to the likes of the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/"> Turtles Cowabunga Collection</a>.</p>


<p>There are a range of Gextras (Limited Run’s pun, though one I thoroughly approve of) included such as trailers, artwork, and a soundtrack player. These are nice inclusions, but feel a little clunky – the music player in particular is difficult to use. A better alternative would have been a separate soundtrack download as is the case with many collector’s editions. Looking back at the print and TV ads for the games is certainly illuminating in a nostalgic way and sets the scene for the lad’s mag and celebrity culture they were written to cater to.</p>


<p>With the context set, let’s turn to the games. First up is the 2D original Gex which is a landmark title having first been released on the 3D0 in 1995. Billed as the first 32-bit platformer it certainly turned heads back in the day, but not far enough to rescue a doomed system. Pretty soon after it was ported to PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, and it’s the former version that’s included here.</p>
<p>All that history in min,d I should probably talk about the game itself, but it’s honestly awful. Floaty controls, an overly large sprite and confusing level design all combine to make a title that is difficult to enjoy. If you do try it in order to experience the full series then at least there is a rewind function similar to most emulation programs (familiar if you’ve used the Switch Online systems) to help make it past some of the most frustrating and annoying sections. Trust me, you’ll be using this a lot.</p>

<p>With that Gextremely annoying first title out of the way things take a turn for the better. Gex: Enter the Gecko is a very traditional 3D platformer which clearly takes a great deal of influence from the likes of Mario 64 and especially Rare collectathons. Both PAL and NTSC versions are included in the package and I opted to play the European titles for the Gexclusive voice acting. The second game features the silky tones of legendary lothario Leslie Philips which makes for some entertaining incongruities as he quotes now dated cultural references such as “It’s like I’ve woken up in Boy George’s pants!”</p>
<p>Traversal through the game takes the familiar route of a hub world with portals to levels in which multiple objectives can be completed. Doing so unlocks remotes which in turn open up more levels and boss battles. While you don’t need to collect every remote to finish the game there is an Gextra ending scene in each game if you do so apparently (although they seemed to play for me without having done so). Every level also has Gexclusive collectables and gathering enough also awards a remote. As you work through the game you’ll visit a range of worlds inspired by TV and film including classic horror, kung fu movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. Gex has different costumes for each world, but these are entirely cosmetic in this title aside from a memorable boss fight where Gex gets to act out your T-Gex fantasies and fight as a kaiju.</p>

<p>The third game in the trilogy, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, takes all the mechanics and systems from the second and improves on them. The hub world makes another appearance, although this time it’s a secret agent base for Gex who is now voiced by Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf fame. While the more modern voice acting is a much better fit for the sassy lizard, there are still the same dated references and parts that have not aged well. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Baywatch babe as Agent Xtra – Marliece Andrada, also known for the epic Playboy babes of Baywatch. Her appearances are mostly restricted to cringey video calls in which Gex gets to make some of the most inappropriate lines this side of an 80s Bond movie. The ending of the game famously suggests an altercation between the two heroes that the Angry Video Game Nerd was not Gexpecting. A Wild West level in which Gex rides a donkey also includes a caricature of the lizard as a Gexican that wouldn’t pass the sniff test nowadays.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gex Trilogy is a good window into the history of gaming and the 3D games are still fun collectathon platformers, albeit with all the camera and control issues of the originals, and the awful 2D original I never want to play again. I would have liked to see a more Gexpansive remaster, and the result may not be entirely Gexceptional, but offers enough Gexperience to give you the kind of Gexual healing that only true nostalgia can provide.	</p></div>

		<p>91Act has announced that the side scrolling roguelike BlazBlue Entropy Effect will launch globally on July 22nd for Android and iOS, following an earlier release in China which saw the game get downloaded six million times. BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a spin off from the BlazBlue fighting series, taking the combat style and action from that to embed it in a different genre. The game is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">Steam</a>, where it has over 25,000 reviews and sits at very positive.</p>

		<p>Jelly Troops has been revealed by developer Nukenin Co and publisher Phoenixx Inc, with the game looking like a good, casual real time strategy title focused around capturing flags. The setting pits two wizards and their armies of jellies against each other, with players having to make critical decisions that could lead to victory in these capture the flag missions.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Release on Sept. 17th 2025]A Squishy, Strategic Caputre-the-Flag Battle &quot;Jelly Troops&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nRjcedP8cA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Jelly Troops&nbsp;is as deep as it is cute. The inviting blue-pink aesthetic contrasts against very tense gameplay,”</em> says Waken, solo developer of Jelly Troops. <em>“The mind games are near-endless. We can’t wait to watch the meta develop over time!”</em></p>
<p>In Jelly Troops, players will need to literally grow their armies by planting Magic Fruits at base, with these fruits producing jellies. These Magic Fruits are dotted around the map, so this in itself becomes a fight for resources. It won’t be as simple as grabbing the fruits though, as powerful golems also patrol the maps. These golems can kill in one hit, so you need to find ways to move them out of your way and make them an inconvenience for your enemy. To win, you need to capture the flag and there are different approaches to this. The most obvious is by having a bigger army and overwhelming defences, but you can also send in smaller groups to sneak in and steal the flag. Various power ups will either help or hinder, with powers such as invisibility, lightning strikes, and summoning guardians all having their own impact on how things will unfold.</p>

<p>Jelly Troops has been announced for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of September 17th.</p>
