		<p>Legion Studios has released a new trailer for Covenant, a first-person dark fantasy combat game, coming from a team of former AAA game developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Covenant casts you as a warrior angel, coming down to exact martial arts vengeance on those who stand in your way, creatures from fallen empires that remain.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of blurb:</p>
<p><i>Experience Creation through the eyes of the last living messenger – a warrior angel sent to carry out the will of the Composers. The oldest of your kind, Malach, has fallen to the abyss – leaving in his wake a trail of destruction. You must follow in the footsteps of his final days in order to uncover the nature of his fall – and in doing so, reveal the slumbering forces hidden within Creation.</i></p>

<p>Featuring an interconnected Soulslike world that is punctuated by major boss battles, the hook here is that you’re playing in first person, using different fighting stances, spells and weapons in battle. Adaptability is key here, where different stances completely overhaul your fighting style, down to the way that you jump and kick, which is mixed with the variety of weapons available to you. These can, similar to Bloodborne, be used in a 1-hand and 2-hand form, making you more powerful but less mobile.</p>
<p>Player progression comes from crafting and applying upgrades in ring slots, while weapons are upgraded, spells grow stronger and new stances are discovered.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting sounding game with a mix of Soulslike and first person quite a distinctive one. We’re keen to see how this comes together.</p>
