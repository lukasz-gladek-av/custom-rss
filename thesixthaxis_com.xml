		<p>AdHoc Studios has announced that its superhero comedy game Dispatch will release on October 22nd for PC and PS5, at least the first two episodes will. Dispatch will release episodically over four weeks with two episodes being dropped every week, meaning 8 episodes in total to dispatch your team of heroes to stop crime, and try to take down the Shroud and the Red Ring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch - Official PC and PS5 Release Date Trailer (ft. Aaron Paul, Jeffrey Wright)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrWos4NShT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey, Jeffrey Wright, Erin Yvette, Jacksepticeye, Moistcritical, Alanah Pearce, Travis Willingham, Matthew Mercer, Joel Haver, Lance Cantstopolis, and Thot Squad. There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but thereâ€™s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>
