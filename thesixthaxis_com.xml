		<p>Creepy Jar has released new footage of StarRupture with ten minutes that shows off the world as well as some gameplay from the latest build. The video acts as a tour of Arcadia-7 showing off the inviting looking environment that holds lots of perils and dangers to be aware of. Players will have to get familiar with those dangers pretty quickly while base building.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture: The World of Arcadia-7 Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srtUwMGwCuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days. If you are interested in StarRupture you will have to wait a little bit longer to get hands on with it. Creepy Jar has confirmed that StarRupture will be coming to Steam Early Access in the autumn.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">Green Hell Review</a></h2>
<p>Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and in our review Steve said, <em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

		<p>Microsoft is raising prices on Xbox consoles in a number of major markets around the world, the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>In the UK the Xbox Series X will now cost £499.99, a £20 jump, and the 512GB Xbox Series S will be £299.99, a £50 jump.</p>


<p>In Europe, the Xbox Series X will now cost €599.99, a €50 jump, and the 512GB Xbox Series S will be €349.99, a €50 jump.</p>
<p>And the US is facing the steepest price increases with the Xbox Series X now $599.99, a $100 jump, and 512GB Xbox Series S now $429.99, an $80 increase. The price of headsets and certain controllers are increasing in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>In the longer term, Microsoft has announced that some first party games will launch with a $79.99 retail price this winter – so Doom: The Dark Ages is unaffected later this month, and existing releases are not changing. Xbox Game Pass subscriptions also aren’t changing price at this time.</p>

<p>In the support page announcing the changes, Microsoft says, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”</p>
<p>The price hike follows Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">increasing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in the UK, Europe, Australia and NZ</a>, and with console and game pricing very much in the focus of gamers following the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">pricing announcements</a>. Microsoft has also just posted their quarterly financials, which showed gaming revenue increasing, while Xbox hardware sales continued to trend downwards.</p>
<p>This all comes, of course, in the shadow of Trump’s tariffs in the US. While the price increases have hit the US hardest, it could look like Microsoft is spreading the burden of those import tariffs across the globe, hoping to lessen the blow in their biggest market.</p>
<p>So, that’s nice.</p>
