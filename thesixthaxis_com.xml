		<p>It appears Ubisoft have settled on a name for their heavily leaked remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> as a domain has been registered with the game’s name and “Resynced” added to the end.</p>
<p>The Black Flag Resynced domain was registered 25 days ago by a company Ubisoft has used previously, including for the registration of the latest Prince of Persia game.&nbsp; Ubisoft have said they would be plundering their back catalogue for remakes and remasters but they have yet to officially announce this remake. That has not stopped lots of details leaking out.</p>


<p>It seems like the remake, which will use Anvil Pipeline engine, is going to feature some fairly big changes. The most notable change will be the removal of all the modern-day sequences so we will not see Rebbeca, Shaun and the others. The modern-day plot, which worked really well in the first few games with Desmond, has gradually been side-lined and only appears as text in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Replacing it will be “a few extra hours of content” including content that was cut from the original release, such as parts of Mary Read’s story.</p>
<p>Gameplay is said to be closer to the RPG style of the more recent games, with loot, stats for weapons, and a new inventory. The combat is is also said to lean more towards the style of the recent games. The map is the same size but will have more things to do, and modern systems mean there will be no loading screens when docking your ship and heading to land.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngrBQnukFc">report from the respected Jeux Vidéo Magazine s</a>uggests the game will now launch in early 2026, probably in March, which is a little later than previous reports. Ubisoft Singapore, Belgrade and Bordeaux are working on it, and some assets from Skull &amp; Bones may be reused to save costs.</p>

		<p>Welcome back to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> countdown where we now enter the Top 40, as though we were counting down the top 40 songs of the week. In this list, there is a real big mix of genres with no game here quite like the other. We’ve got fighting in space, fighting in space again, fighting on the streets, fighting in the jungle, and then fighting in a cartoon. Yes, there is lots violence and some resource management ahead.</p>
<h2>40 – Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</h2>
<p><em>PC – Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a> is one of my favourite TV series, even if it did lose its way towards the end. A story of humanity fleeing through space while being chased by the unrelenting Cylons, and the personal stories of the people living through it all really grabbed the attention of millions of people. There have been Battlestar Galactica games before, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hope">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> provides a new way to experience this universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNCBvhusit8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are not part of Admiral Adama’s fleet, but a Gunstar Captain who is on their own journey leading a fleet of survivors trying to join Admiral Adama. However, the journey will be tough, and the gameplay will lend to that. That’s because Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is roguelite where your choices determine how resources are allocated across the fleet, how you manage each faction’s demands, and how you survive encounters with the Cylons. With each run, you will learn which tools work for different situations and get unlocks that will provide some advantage in your future runs. Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is essentially <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ftl">FTL</a> on a grander scale.</p>

<h2>39 – R-Type Dimensions III</h2>
<p><em>PS5, NSW2, NSW, PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is one that side scrolling shooter fans should be keeping an eye on. It is a game using rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning, allowing players to experience classic gameplay in both 2D and 3D options visual options. You can see it the announcement trailer how the two styles look.</p>
<p><iframe title="R-Type Dimensions III Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXOKxxPsUvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the visual upgrade, R-Type Dimensions III will also feature local co-op multiplayer with a change in the scoring along with new survival mechanics. It will also made advanced mode available from the very beginning, and new accessibility options too.</p>
<h2>38 – Samson: A Tyndalston Story</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2026</em></p>
<p>When one of the main creators of the Just Cause franchise announces a new game with their new studio, Liquid Swords, you sit up and listen. Just Cause built up a huge fan base for its open world where players could use their imaginations to cause havoc in various ways. Now Christofer Sundberg and the team at Liquid Swords are taking elements of that legacy to create a new, more grounded experience in Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Samson is in a load of debt, and the people he owes are now coming to collect. To pay that money back Samson has to take on various missions from hits to getaway driving to try and pay the debt down. What is interesting about Samson is that you cannot just go and do every mission, with only so many missions that can be done in a day. There is no mission fail state either, so you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. Liquid Swords has also said that vehicle combat is going to be a key element of the game and every vehicle can be used as a weapon, as well as items in the environment when getting into street fights. We also know that the main story of Samson: A Tyndalston Story will last around 10 hours, but over double that if players choose to explore the city in depth.</p>
<h2>37 – Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a> is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I have taken part in. Massive battlefields with teams of 50 going against each other in battles that can be slow and suddenly have bursts of action, with players needing to communicate to really get the best of the game to complete objectives. It was a tough enough experience in the setting of World War II, so the sequel being set in Vietnam is going to add a whole new set of challenges for players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of the open battlefields of the original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a> puts you in the dense jungles where American and Vietcong forces battled a mix of open and guerrilla warfare. Players are going to have access to a lot more tools with helicopters and boats both being core vehicles to use to navigate, along with the tunnels the Vietcong constructed to bypass and ambush soldiers. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has the potential to be one of the most ambitious and memorable multiplayer experiences of 2026.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August.</p>
<h3>36 – Mouse: PI For Hire</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Mouse: PI For Hire looks like the kind of game that could absolutely become a cult classic. It essentially takes the animation artstyle of the 1930s and bends it into video game form, making the whole thing set in the city of Mouseburg and making all the character mice that would fit in any early Disney cartoon. It then adds the great twist of taking that family friendly style and turning it into a noir-styled first person shooter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire | Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Mouse: PI For Hire you are Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker. Things start off with the classic damsel in distress opening that a cornerstone of a lot of noir fiction, but what is said to follow is a dive into the corrupt criminal underworld of Mouseburg where not everything is as it seems. You will be able to explore places like the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks, with each having loot and collectibles.</p>
<p><em>Five more games down, and it doesn’t take a private investigator (mouse or otherwise) to figure out that there’ll be another fistful of games coming in a list tomorrow as well!</em></p>
