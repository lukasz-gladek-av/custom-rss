		<p>Sony has announced that it will be streaming a State of Play this Thursday, February 12th, and the stream will last around an hour. There is no specific game being showcased this State of Play, with it instead being a more general one with updates from a number of game developers. That could mean we will see quite a few new announcements, as well as updates on games that Sony has previously announced.</p>

<p>The timings for the State of Play are 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 10PM GMT, 11PM CET, and Feb 13th 7AM JST. There have been rumours that Sony would be hosting a State of Play, so this confirmation was not completely unexpected. In terms of what games will be shown, well we can only speculate. Maybe we’ll see some more of Marvel’s Wolverine, or Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet though I would expect that to get its own State of Play closer to when it is ready for release. We will have to wait until Thursday for the updates.</p>
