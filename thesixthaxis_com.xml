		<p>This week saw the global launch of Pokemon TCG Pocket for Android and iOS devices, having been available in New Zealand for the last month. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>

<p>Today, following the global launch on October 30th, sees the first event that players can take part in outside of the standard missions. This event is Wonder Pick Event Part 1, with Chansey and Meowth being the focus. From today, and for the next two weeks, special promo card versions of Chansey and Meowth will appear in Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>
<p>Alongside the chance to get either the promo Chansey or Meowth, there are also new additions to the the Pokemon TCG Pocket shop, which are only available for the duration of the Wonder Pick Event Part 1. The three items available are a Meowth backdrop, a Meowth binder cover, and a pink desk frame to use for display boards. There are no new card sleeves, Pokemon flip coins, or playmats. The event items all cost 3 event shop tickets each.</p>

		<p>Red Barrels has announced that it is partnering with Lionsgate to create a movie based on Outlast, with the game series writer, JT Petty, handling the writing of the screenplay. The Outlast movie is going to be produced by Roy Lee, who has previously been a producer on the likes of The Strangers: Chaper 1, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and IT. No actors have yet been confirmed for any of the roles for the Outlast movie.</p>
<p><em>“As die-hard fans of horror ourselves, we hold immense respect for Roy Lee and Lionsgate,”</em> said David Chateauneuf, Co-Founder and Creative Director at Red Barrels. <em>“Horror films, both classic and modern, have profoundly influenced our franchise, and collaborating on an Outlast&nbsp;film with true horror legends is a dream— or should we say, a nightmare—come true.”</em></p>


<p>Roy Lee also had this to say about the Outlast movie. <em>“When Outlast launched in 2013, it changed the landscape of horror gaming,” Roy explains. “Its deep, emergent lore provides the perfect foundation for a film that explores the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and dedicated fans.”</em></p>
<p>The Outlast series kicked off in 2013 with the original game, which was a first person horror game in which players took on the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explored the Mount Massive Asylum, which contained a lot of secrets and horrors to avoid and escape from. This was followed by the prequel Outlast: Whistleblower, in which players are Waylon Park, a software engineer at the asylum who gets the word out to Miles which leads to the events of the first game. Outlast 2 followed in 2017, introducing a new protagonist called Blake Langermann, another investigative journalist, who finds himself a poor rural area where a doomsday cult lives. The Outlast Trials is the most recent game, adding a multiplayer spin to the series.</p>
