		<p>Splitgate 2 is dead. Long live Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. This is the new iteration of Splitgate, the arena-based shooter with its trademark portals, and it’s launching today in full, leaving beta behind, arriving for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded combines the best of the rewarding DNA of the original Splitgate with the innovations of Splitgate 2, delivering the ultimate Splitgate experience. The new era of Splitgate celebrates its roots, eliminating factions and abilities while re-emphasizing the kinetic arena gameplay of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded also evolves the impressive movement mechanics and immersive visual worlds that distinguished Splitgate 2, delivering momentum and polish in every match.</p>
<p>Here’s a detailed look at what’s going live:</p>
<h3>Five New Maps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hammerhead: The movement never stops as the combat unfolds in a giant rolling tank.</li>
<li>Terra 13: A large, circular map in the valley of a mountainous space colony.</li>

<li>Oasis: The sun, the sand, the verticality. A port of Splitgate’s desert palm-tree playground.</li>
<li>Karman Station: The very first Splitgate map, reimagined.</li>
</ul>

<li>Added Free For All (FFA) Deathmatch, Shotty Snipers, Team SWAT, Gun Game and Team Fiesta to Quickplay mode selection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved Performance, Especially for Last-Gen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made extensive performance optimizations across the board both within Unreal Engine itself and all of the tech we have built on top of it.</li>
<li>Significantly improved frame rates, reduced hitching/stutters and minimized mid-match stalls.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>New Store Experience, Lower Prices and Splitcoin Refunds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced bundle prices across nearly the entire store, with nothing above $20.</li>
<li>Automatic reimbursement of price difference via Splitcoin for previously purchased Splitgate 2 bundles whose prices are now reduced.</li>
<li>Added new Proelium Exchange for players to purchase weapon cosmetics with the newly earnable Proelium upgrade currency.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Streamlined Battle Pass w/ New Ultra Tier</h3>
<ul>

<li>New Primary Weapons – Light Machine Guns (LMGs): Velocity (large-mag), Strata (four-round burst fire) and Barrage (triple barrel chaingun that shoots three at a time).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refreshed Audio</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ability to swap custom materials.</li>
<li>New skybox and lighting options.</li>
<li>New color-picker tool, refreshed gamepad</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally release in June, Splitgate 2 immediately split the Splitgate fanbase, with a host of microtransactions, some of which were eye-wateringly expensive, while adding a new Battle Royale mode despite the team having previously criticising Call of Duty et al.</p>

<p>The story of Splitgate 2 is one of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The first game was an unexpected indie shooter hit, entering the exceedingly competitive multiplayer shooter arena and staking its claim to a place on the battlefield. It’s heavily Halo-inspired gunplay found a legion of fans, and so it was expected that Splitgate 2 should have been a continuation of that success. The beta period was tough though, with a mixture of unpopular changes to the game’s formula and an odd public appearance from Ian Proulx in a “Make FPS Great Again” cap, that didn’t sit well with a portion of the community.</p>
<p>It looks as though the team have done a lot of work to counter all these issues though, and we hope that they find the success they deserve with the relaunch of the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Carmageddon: Rogue Shift first five vehicles have been detailed]]></title>

		<p>Developer 34BigThings has posted a new blog giving details on five of the 17 vehicles that will be available in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. Each of these five cars has different attributes changing how you can handle the track and the weapon load outs. With such varied styles for each one, there will be clear favourites depending on your own playstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Eagle GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxKie2O5ZoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first of the cars is the Eagle GT which is considered a good allrounder muscle car, with its best attribute being its handling. It also has armour and is heavier than most of the other vehicles in the game, making it useful for close melee encounters with others. The Eagle GT’s starting weapon is the machine gun which can be lethal against metal and flesh, but its effectiveness drops the further away you are from your target. The starting perk is Boost Refill which lets you start a race with a boost bottle, and refunds it if you get reset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Clunker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4d9jXu92N84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first unlockable vehicle in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is the Clunker. The Clunker is one of the tankier options available where its durability and defense is very high, but this comes at the cost of speed so it will not win outright. Instead, players using The Clunker should be more focused on getting close to other players and taking them down by either bashing into them or using the shotgun. The Tank Return perk increases damage output the more you improve the Clunker’s defense.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Firecracker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJYzOm3olY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Firecracker Turbo is the care for players who value speed over all else. Acceleration is this vehicle’s top stat followed by speed, meaning players can dominate in a straight line but there is the risk of spinning out if control is not maintained. The Firecracker Turbo comes equipped with missiles to take out anyone who passes, while the Magic Number perk gives boost and ammo bonuses but only on every 7th use.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - SQR-NE55" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmvm6PA_Obs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The SQR-NE55 is the most balanced vehicle of the bunch, an allrounder with no standout stats, with this being a car to choose once you are confident with game. While it has no standout stats, the SQR-NE55 does have a laser gun that can do heavy damage at all ranges. The vehicle comes with the Whale perk which gives upgrade discounts and free restocks so you can shape the SQR-NE55 into your own style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Hawk GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsbBYSbkvTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hawk GT is a vehicle that as top speed, offense, and acceleration but at the sacrifice of handling, meaning all of that power under the hood is useless if you can’t keep it on the track. The Hawk GT is armed with a high-caliber shotgun which is slow to use but deals high damage to targets, and the vehicle also comes equipped with the Meat Shield perk which increases durability with every undead that is defeated.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>
