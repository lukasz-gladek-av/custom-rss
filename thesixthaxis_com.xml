		<p>2K and Gearbox have released a new story trailer for Borderlands 4, which shows us some elements of the setting of the next entry to the series. In this trailer, we see some of how The Timekeeper, the main antagonist of Borderlands 4, rules the planet of Kairos. The Timekeeper does this from a tower in Dominion City, with his Commander’s executing his will (and enemies) across the rest of Kairos. This follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/check-out-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-reveal-everything-we-now-know/">the Borderlands 4 gameplay reveal</a> that took place at the end of April.</p>

<p>As a Vault Hunter you are not just looking for treasures across Kairos. You have a run in with The Timekeeper and as a result events are set into motion where you, and other Vault Hunters, are on a mission to end The Timekeeper’s iron fisted regime and bring freedom to Kairos. There will be characters across Kairos that will be sympathetic to your cause too and will be allies in the fight that will determine the future of the planet. You can play Borderlands 4 alone or team up with others in four player co-op, exploring the planet, fighting bandits and bosses, and discovering lots of different weapons. Looting has been revamped for Borderlands 4 with Legendaries being much rarer, with decent weapons easier to find. Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is now available to pre-order with the standard version priced at £69.99. There is a digital deluxe edition available for £89.99 which includes Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin, Gilded Glory Pack, and Bounty Pack Bundle. The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at £119.99, includes the items from the deluxe edition along with the Ornate Order Pack and the Vault Hunter Pack. Those who pre-order the game will get the Gilded Glory pack and that includes a Vault Hunter skin, a weapon skin, and an Echo-4 drone skin.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 will release on September 12th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
