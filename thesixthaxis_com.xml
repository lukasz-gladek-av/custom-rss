<ul>
<li>Bug fixing and performance improvements to make sure everyone’s first experience is the best it can be</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Lighting improvements and optimization</li>
<li>Collision passes</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Blood effect and logics rework</li>
<li>Improved visuals and geometries of different vehicles</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Boss vehicles’ trails</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Revamped some tutorials</li>
<li>Polished End Run screen</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Vehicle integrity audio system</li>
<li>Sidebash and boost SFX polish</li>
<li>Weapons’ SFX polish</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Cinematic to gameplay transition polish</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of unfortunate last-minute regressions may cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>”Cycle Camera” and “Horn” inputs are inverted in the Controls screen :s</li>
<li>Unexpected flickering of the central square of the weapon lock indicator when multiple targets are simultaneously locked</li>
<li>Occasional missing HP bar from Piccolo Enforcers and some Special Wasted</li>

<li>Incorrect proportions of opponent indicators on the minimap on some small screens, eg. the Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of what to expect, 34BigThings has announced the main features that it expects to add in patches one and two. In patch one, the main addition will be a bonnet cam allowing players a more close up view of the action. In patch two, the aim is to add a Challenge mode which will add a variety of modifiers including harder opponents, resource scarcity, deadlier Wasted, and no retries. 34BigThings will also be looking at adding steering wheel support with the release of patch two.</p>

		<p>The Six Nations is back, having kicked off on Thursday with a thorough drubbing of Ireland by France. Has that set the narrative for this year’s competition?

<p>In our MIO: Memories In Orbit review, I said, <em>“MIO: Memories In Orbit is an early contender for one of the most memorable games of 2026. It is an incredibly challenging game to play, with combat being a highlight, even if some platforming section can be frustrating. It looks fantastic, though, and the story is well told. MIO: Memories In Orbit draws you in, and does not let go easily. It is hard game but the journey is worth experiencing.”</em></p>
