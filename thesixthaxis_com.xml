		<p>Warner Bros. has confirmed reports that they are shutting down three of their game studios, closing Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego is what they’re describing as a “strategic change in direction”.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>, the publisher’s statement says, “We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.”</p>


<p>Of particular note is the closure of Monolith Productions, who was working on a Wonder Woman video game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">first announced in 2021</a>. This game was the subject of reporting earlier this month that stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/report-rocksteady-working-on-single-player-batman-as-wonder-woman-game-rebooted/">the game’s development had been rebooted</a> within the last year after creative leads left the studio.</p>
<p>Monolith’s last game was Middle-earth: Shadow of War, back in 2017, the studio having pioneered the patented Nemesis system with their first Middle-earth game three years earlier. However, the studio’s storied history goes back much further with landmark titles like FEAR, the niche and kitschy No One Lives Forever, and Aliens vs. Predator 2.</p>
<p>Player First Games was the studio behind online multiplayer brawler MultiVersus, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">burst onto the scene with its open beta in 2022</a>, but ultimately flopped at its 2024 relaunch, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">recently sunset by WB</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, WB Games San Diego was a studio founded in 2019 and had reportedly been working on an unannounced “AAA, free-to-play, cross-platform game.”</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been struggling for quite some time, it seems, and these three studios are seeing the wider consequences of those struggles. This feels like less of a “change in direction” and more about WB making a cold financial decision. Wonder Woman’s long-running development will have been very costly, and there was seemingly no end in sight, while Player First would have been right back at the start of the development cycle. “AAA, free-to-play” has also gone from seeming like a sure bet to company execs to a massive risk.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how many jobs are being lost as part of these studio closures, and Warner Bros. has not publicly explained what redundancy and support packages they will be offering to those affected.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go to those suddenly out of work, and hope that they can find new employment soon.</p>

		<p>All children of the 90s love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – or Hero Turtles depending on which backwater country doesn’t allow children near the word ‘Ninjas’. The truth is they’re both heroes and ninjas, and they’re having a very 2020 revival right now, with a series of digital adventures showing that there’s plenty of hero left in those half-shells. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover is the newest game in the canon, but, as the title suggests, this is going to be a very different kind of adventure for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover – I swear, that’s going to be TMNT: TT by the time we get to the end of this news story – takes our beloved turtles into uncharted territory, because unlike recent hits like beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">TMNT: Shredders Revenge</a>, or the rogue-like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>, Tactical Takeover is a turn-based strategy, owing more to games like X-COM or Fire Emblem than it does to Streets of Rage. It’s an interesting idea, and given that the team are one of the most beloved groups in the last thirty years it feels like it’ll pay off. I particularly appreciate the range of experiences that Turtles fans can enjoy right now, and rather than resting on the simple ‘smacking people about’ action that you’d expect, this offers a new cerebral take on the green group.</p>
<p>What’s even better, is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">you can try it out right now</a>, with a demo appearing as part of the Steam Next-Fest. It’s a real blast, and you can stay tuned for a full preview of it in the coming days. The Steam Next Fest demo features a tutorial and a modified version of the first chapter of the game, inviting players to experience the turtle action first-hand as they take on the Foot Clan.</p>


<p>It sounds as though they’re going through some stuff too, with both Splinter and Shredder dead, and the beloved gang starting to fall apart. Hopefully you can keep them together – though not if that’s strategically a bad idea, you need to watch out for area of effect attacks, of course.</p>
<p>The game’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, which is the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., best known for his work as a lead developer on I Am Your Beast, CLICKOLDING, El Paso, Elsewhere, and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. We’re certainly intrigued, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more ahead of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover’s launch on PC later this year.</p>
