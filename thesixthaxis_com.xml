		<p>Expression Games and Team 17 have announced a follow up to the 2021 WW2 multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a>, with this new game taking us to an altogether different war. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be set during the Vietnam War, which took place between 1965 to 1973, moving players from the battlefields of Europe to the jungle terrain of the South East Asian nation.</p>

<p>When Hell Let Loose: Vietnam launches it will feature six different maps where teams of 50 will face off against each other to fight for victory and, much like the original, communication between players will be essential to getting the advantage. The Vietnam War was fought in entirely different ways to WW2, and that means there are new additions coming to in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p>These additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>
<p>A release date for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is to be confirmed, but it will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Expression Games has also confirmed that the original Hell Let Loose will continue to get support and updates too.</p>

<p>Given just how persistent the calls are for Battlefield to return to a Vietnam War setting, this is bound to be a popular announcement. We’ll have a preview of the game shortly.</p>

<p>In our Hell Let Loose review, I wrote, <em>“Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.”</em></p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced Surviving Mars Relaunched, an expanded version of 2018’s Surviving Mars. This relaunch version will include the base game, all of the original DLCs, including content packs and radio stations. Paradox has also confirmed that those with the original release will have an upgrade pathway, but the original version of Surviving Mars will be removed from sale on all platforms when Relaunched is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surviving Mars Relaunched | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTU0f4tlg5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Surviving Mars: Relaunched is not just going to be a repackage of Surviving Mars, with this release including user interface improvements as well as new content. That new content is called Martian Assembly, something not available in the original release, where a dynamic political system will be added. In the Martian Assembly, you will pass laws to balance the needs and wants of the colonists including domestic matters to full Martian independence.</p>
<p>If you own Surviving Mars and want to upgrade to Surviving Mars Relaunched, you will get a discount. Paradox has said, <em>” An automatic discount of $20 on the standard price $39.99 (discounted price $19.99) will be applied to your purchase of the base game Surviving Mars: Relaunched if the original Surviving Mars is already in your library. The discount will only be applied if you are purchasing it on the same platform and using the same account as your original purchase. The offer cannot be applied across platforms.”</em></p>

<p>In our Surviving Mars review, Stefan wrote, <em>“If we ever try to colonise our red neighbour, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges that mankind will ever undertake. Though Surviving Mars makes a game out of it, Haemimont have brilliantly kept that hard edge, as it constantly pushes and tests your ability to plan with survival in mind, especially with the unpredictability of the Mysteries of Mars. There’s plenty of ways to improve it and put more colony control in the hands of the player, but the first landing is already off to a great start.”</em></p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed Tropico 7 for 2026, with the game confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox Game Pass. This new entry into the long running series will introduce new elements including face to face talks with different faction leaders, and the ability to terraform the island to suit your own needs. If a river is not running in the direction you like, feel free to reroute it. You also be able to pick different dictatorship styles depending on political affiliations and the use of edicts.</p>

<p><em>“With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics — giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love,”</em> says Daniel Dumont, Studio and Creative Director at Gaming Minds Studios. <em>“This isn’t just a sequel, it’s the ultimate sandbox for would-be dictators. El Presidente would say: ‘The best Tropico ever — because it’s mine!’”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/01/tropico-6-review/">Tropico 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tropico 6 review, Nick said, <em>“Tropico 6 feels like the kind of game that you can fall back on when every other game gets a little too stressful. The economy can be tricky to get started, but you can soon start to kick back and take it easy. If you are finding it too hard though, turn on unlimited money and enjoy your break. It’s almost like going on holiday to the Caribbean, which is fitting really.”</em></p>
