		<p>The Sunday of not-E3 is renowned as Microsoft’s time to shine. It’s fair to say that recent years haven’t quite set hearts racing, no matter how good Xbox output like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed have been, so it’s a welcome surprise to find that Xbox haven’t just rolled out a few smart-looking trailers, with the earth-shattering announcement that they’re set to release the very first Xbox handheld. It’s not even just one, with the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X providing two different tiers of Xbox handheld. This is a great day for Xbox gamers.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The quickest among you will note that the ROG Ally is a thing that already exists. ROG’s Ally, and it’s more powerful follow-up the Ally X, are PC handhelds that have spent the last few years competing with Valve’s Steam Deck for portable PC gamers’ hearts. There’s a very strong argument to say that they’re the better option, though they’ve been hamstrung by Microsoft’s own Windows platform which was never made specifically for a handheld format. </p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are the best of both worlds, the partnership between the two companies giving you access to your entire Xbox library as well as opening up the world of PC gaming to you as well, including all of the PC based stores like Steam and the Epic Game Store. </p>
<p>The Xbox Ally and Ally X have had some obvious physical changes made to them over ROGs older versions of the Ally, most noticeably in the extended, and presumably far more ergonomic hand grips. The Steam Deck’s comfort levels were the last bastion of defence that Steam Deck owners had over Ally owners, and we can’t wait to see if the Xbox Ally and Ally X trounce them, becoming the most comfortable PC handheld out there. </p>


<p>They’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, alongside 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor as well as a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. They’re both going to be serious gaming machines – the original Ally has been a fantastic option, with a less powerful chipset, so we can’t wait to see how the new pair will perform. </p>
<p>Both have 7″ 1080p full HD screens, with a 120Hz refresh rate, and Freesync Premium onboard, which should mean everything will look super smooth and bright.</p>

		<p>Coming from Lee Petty and Double Fine, Keeper is a wonderful looking narrative adventure where you play as a lighthouse come to life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Keeper is a story told without words”, Double Fine writes in the trailer blurb, “in which a long-forgotten lighthouse is awakened and, joined by a spirited seabird, embarks upon a heartening tale of unlikely companionship and an unexpected journey into realms beyond understanding.”</p>
<p>It honestly looks delightful with all the charm that you would expect from Double Fine. The Lighthouse reassembles itself after falling over in a storm, forming legs for itself and then scrambling crab-like across the land. The rickety structure is full of personality, and can look and shine light from its top. It also makes friends with a seabird who wants to come along for the ride.</p>
<p>Keeper is in development for Xbox Series X|S, PC and will on Xbox Game Pass on day one, the game launching on 17th October.</p>

<p>This is the first game from Double Fine since Psychonauts 2, which I handed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">a fantastic 9/10 back in 2021</a>. Is said, “A decade and a half on from the original, Psychonauts 2 is a worthy successor to Double Fine’s cult classic. The platforming and combat gameplay is tighter, the world design is as varied and inventive as ever, and while the story is full of twists, turns and comedic moment, there’s also a wonderful sense of empathy and tenderness throughout. Simply put, Psychonauts 2 has been worth the wait.”</p>
