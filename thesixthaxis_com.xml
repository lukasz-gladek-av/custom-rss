			<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/10/aaero-review/">Aaero</a> came out of nowhere, and remains, to this day, one of my favourite rhythm-action games. Merging the classic gunplay of Space Harrier and Panzer Dragoon with musical movement was an inspired creative decision, and Aaero had you riding the rails – called ribbons here – in time with a bass-heavy electronic soundtrack, using your craft to mimic the changing notes. Aaero2: Black Razor Edition sees the Mad Fellows team returning to their signature series, this time boasting a stellar soundtrack from Monstercat, new multiplayer modes, and additional music packs, promising to take players on an even wilder ride through space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aaero2: Black Razor Edition | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZ7g_muNvfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Riding the ribbon is an exercise in deft left stick control. You roll from left to right, but as the music features pauses or major note changes, you’ll find yourself launching your spacecraft from point to point, trying to hang onto the ribbon and, in turn, your health. It’s far trickier than it has any business being, but, like a NASCAR driver, this is all about keeping things smooth, gently coaxing your craft around the track.</p>


<p>You’ve also got to think about shooting. The right stick controls your weaponry, and you can lock onto enemies by holding the reticule over them, increasing the number of missiles the longer you stay in one spot. If you release your missiles in time with the music, you’ll ramp up your score, and if you get it perfectly on the beat, you’ll immediately reload any empty missile slots.</p>


<p>You’ve also got an autocannon for faster-moving enemies, and the better you aim, the more points you’ll earn for each shot. When you’re chasing high scores – each track gives you a star rating and a percentage indicator – Aaero2 gives you a lot to think about. It all fits together perfectly once you’re in the flow of it, even if it feels like rubbing your stomach while patting your head at times.</p>
<p>Aaero2 wouldn’t work without a thumping soundtrack to accompany the sci-fi action, and it doesn’t disappoint, with one of the best electronic-infused line-ups since Wipeout. Collected via the Monstercat label – Beat Saber fans will definitely recognise the name – there’s something here for everyone. There’s a trio of MUZZ tracks; Salvation (ft. Bloodhounds) absolutely slaps, while Nemesis is an adrenaline ride of a track. There’s also artists like Habstrakt and Stonebank who keep your sub working overtime, while there’s plenty of light and dark thanks to Hoaprox, YUAN and Haneri collaborating on the more mellow Saviour.</p>

<p>This is a soundtrack that repeatedly had me grinning ear from ear, and when it’s combined with the sci-fi visuals flashing past, Aaero2 is capable of achieving the same kind of synaesthesia that you experience in Tetris Effect, Rez and Lumines Arise. In fact, in Aaero2, Mad Fellows have crafted the most Mizuguchi-like game I’ve found outside of his own teams, and that’s a huge achievement. Music is always going to be individual, and produce a unique response, but this feels like a Monstercat album that’s been produced just for me.</p>
<p>Aaero2 features a series of daily and weekly challenges, with each task netting you a chunk of extra experience. They might ask you to complete a track without using any missiles, or to beat every boss in one week, but they give you an extra reason to check back in for a cheeky extra track or two, and broadly add some longevity to proceedings, even for the most ardent ribbon-rider.</p>
<p>Also, each track’s star and completion percentage tickles the completionist part of your brain perfectly, and you’ll be locking in time after time, trying to perfect one more missile hit, or hold the ribbon just a fraction better. On the normal setting, Aaero2 is a little bit more forgiving on the ribbon riding than its predecessor, locking in more securely, though it doesn’t suddenly make it a breeze by any means.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed your first run through all the tracks though, you’ll unlock Advanced, which removes the magnetic ribbon lock, gives you full ribbons and also more enemies to deal with. This is Aaero2’s true form, with a serious level of challenge, and the opportunity to hit some proper high scores. The fact that there’s Master difficulty above that only goes to show how much challenge the team at Mad Fellows has eked out of Aaero’s gameplay, but no matter what difficulty you’re playing on, it remains utterly enthralling.</p>
<p>You can share that experience with others as well. While online leaderboards remain central to the experience – I love reviewing unreleased games, as I’m currently the best in the world at a series of Aaero2’s tracks – the new multiplayer modes let you play in two-player co-op or PvP, both online or from the comfort of your own couch. It adds a new level of competition and collaboration to proceedings, and if you’ve got a similar taste in music to your friends or family, Aaero2 is an absolute blast.</p>

		<p>Why do we love games? The enjoyment is more than just the bright screens and the action taking place, thought that is usually a big part of it. Another is the story and narrative of games, which can go in all sorts of directions and be told in ways that are very different to books, film, or theatre. Many of the most lauded games are celebrated not just because of gameplay, but for the tales of their characters and the narrative we experience alongside them, the ones that draw us in until we’re eagerly reading messages sent between coworkers while hacking their computers. Which brings us nicely to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game=of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> Best Narrative standouts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">Hundred Line Last Defense Academy</a> is our winner of Best Narrative, or should that be Best <em>Narratives</em>? A story of 15 students having to survive 100 days while holding back monsters, and dealing with the different relationships between the characters while they fight to survive. It is a mammoth game with players able to work towards a staggering 100 different endings. Putting together one narrative is tough enough for most games, so doing it 100 times over and tying those into every single choice you make is work that should be rewarded.</p>


<p>I’m going to quote Miguel here who summed up Hundred Line Last Defense Academy by saying, “It’s this beautifully overwhelming web of stories and paths and branching events where, like, two people can spend dozens of hours playing the game and never have the same experience, or you can just pick it up any time and discover a new story and a new ending. It’s such an insane achievement.”</p>
<h3>Dispatch – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The expectations for Dispatch were high, just from knowing that it was coming from a team that had previously worked on Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Where would they take their episodic storytelling next? Perhaps to offer a fresh perspective on the superhero genre,&nbsp;while also tapping into and succeeding at creating a heartfelt and funny adventure.</p>

<p>You are Robert Robertson, previously known as the hero Mecha Man, who after losing to his nemesis is taken off hero duties and becomes a superhero dispatcher instead, swapping punches for office politics. Office politics are tough enough to deal with, but even more so in Dispatch as you work with ex-supervillains to put them on the path of good. It is also a narrative the explores the themes of identity and learning about who you are as person, while dealing with problems from small issues in the office to life threatening ones that pile on the pressure. Dispatch is a game whose narrative is going to be remembered for a long time.</p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Death is hard enough to deal with as it is when it comes for a loved one. The confusion, the grief, the anger, the reflection, and finally the acceptance are all parts of the journey when it comes. But what if you knew when death was coming for you, and not just you but everyone the same age as you? That is the story Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, where a group of people head out to end the Paintress before she paints the number 33 and wipes out anyone of that age.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a strong story supported by a cast of characters that are memorable, leading to you wanting to spend time with them. Behind it all though is the worry that the Expedition, like so many others before, will fail and the Paintress will live to come after the next age the following year. Alongside that fear and worry are moments of joy and wonder, with the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 providing a stunning playground in which to enjoy the expansive story that has touched so many this year and will do so for years to come. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not just a game for RPG fans, it is a game for those who love everything about stories.</p>
