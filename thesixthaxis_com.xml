		<p>Sassy Chap Games and Team17 have confirmed that the bonkers dating game Date Everything! will be launching on June 17th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. When the title says Date Everything! it means you can date any object in the house you are in. Ever wanted to become closer for your sofa? You can do that. Your toilet has already seen everything, so why not treat it to a conversation?</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything! Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRZe30oSy9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Date Everything you will build up different relationships depending on how your conversations go, and how your stats stack up. Those will lead to three relationship outcomes; love, hate, or friendship. Whatever one you end up on will give you points to improve your own stats, opening up more avenues to explore with your household furniture. All you have to do is put on your special glasses and shoot love beams at the object of your desire. There are over 100 characters to date all of which are fully voiced by the likes of Felicia Day,&nbsp; Ben Starr,&nbsp; Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, Neil Newbon, Troy Baker, and Ashley Burch plus a few others. Between them there are 70,000 lines of dialogue to hear as you get to know the objects in your house on a deeper level.</p>
