		<p>Ubisoft has unwrapped Rainbow Six Siege X, their big overhaul for the decade-old tactical shooter, aiming to prepare the game for the decade to come. As part of that there’s a whole host of technical improvements and updates to the core game, but perhaps the biggest announcement here is that the game is going free-to-play with free access to the bulk of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> experience – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">including the new Dual Front mode</a> – while a paid tier (or a prior purchase) locks away certain modes and operators.</p>



<p>There’s a significant visual overhaul, with Ubisoft going back to rework all of the main materials within the game, upping the detail for things as fundamental as brick walls and wooden planks. Alongside that, there’s refreshed lighting and reflections that are best seen in the maps Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Russian Cafe, and Border. The change can feel very subtle without side-by-side comparisons, but the emphasis is basically on making lighting more realistic, so rooms will likely be a notch darker and light sources, like the sun streaming through windows in Bank, more important. Three more maps will be modernised in the same way with every season going forward, and a new map will be added each season from Year 11.</p>
<p>Maps will also feature new destructible ingredients that can be used tactically. Fire extinguishers can create a temporary smoke screen or even concuss anyone caught in their blast. Gas pipes will cut off an area with a flame that gradually concentrates before exploding to set an area on fire for a little while, and metal detectors are now interactive, and can be disabled temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Audio has been given the 2.0 treatment with better sound propagation and better reverb to make it easier to tell where things are coming from. Sound now passes through walls, instead of just bouncing around the environments, and sounds in a small room will have a different reverb to those in a large room or coming from the exterior.</p>
<p>Oh, and they returned to the motion capture studio to dramatically improve rappelling. You can now rappel round corners, and you can sprint along walls for faster repositioning – though obviously they’ll hear you stomping on the walls from the inside.</p>

<p>Along with all of this there’s to be an overhauled esports section in the menu UI, and Pick and Ban has been rejigged to make it quicker – both teams will choose at the same time, and then get a chance to amend picks and bans when swapping between attack and defence. For prospective newcomers there’s a redone onboarding progression and, most significantly, a shift to free access to the game – ranked, esports and access to the full character roster will require that you pay or have already paid. There’s new tutorials and a Clearance Levels onboarding system that aims to get new players up to speed, first against bots, then other players in Quick Match, before Unranked returns as the standard playlist and feeds into Ranked.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X isn’t a full sequel, but it’s still an important step for the game. There’s the excitement and intrigue that a new game mode inevitably brings, sensible improvements throughout, and making the game free to play and with a new introduction to the game can bring this to a wider audience once more.</p>

		<p>Velan Studios has released Midnight Murder Club into early access, their dark room party game twist on a first person shooter now available for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The game comes in at $19.99 / £15.99, but also has a generous Guest Pass, allowing an owner of the game to bring in a full lobby of buddies using a free Guest Pass version of the game. As a multiplayer game being published by PlayStation, players will require a free PSN account on PC, and an active PS Plus subscription to play on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Early Access Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKc3OtSht98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midnight Murder Club takes the first person shooter and drops it into the pitch-black rooms of Wormwood Manor. Up to six players enter this blacked-out arena with just a revolver and a flashlight, trying to figure out where the other players are from the sound of their movement, flickers of light and sparing use of the flashlight. This could find a niche within the social deduction genre, and could be a hit with Twitch streamer groups because of this.</p>
<p>There’s five game modes in the game as of its early access launch, as described by Velan Studios:</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Free-for-All</strong> – Six brave souls enter the mansion, and the player with the most kills when time runs out prevails among the rest.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Thief in the Night</strong> – Three fearless teams of two scour the mansion for valuable skulls to deposit into a vault. When the last vault closes, the team with the most value accumulated wins.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> – Kill-or-be-killed with your team in a murderous stand-off.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Head Hunters</strong> – Two friends become foes as they hunt the remaining four players as they try to find and burn three hidden demonic totems in the haunting halls.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">New Game Mode: <strong>Wildcards</strong> – Valiant attendees will play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways! From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side! Then, when the dust settles and the match is over, you’ll be gifted brand new cards to add to your collection giving you even more ways to change the game.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about this release is how Velan is opening the door to as many players as possible. Only one person needs to buy and own the game in order to host a full lobby, thanks to the free Guest Pass version of the game. It’s a similar concept to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction’s</a> Friends Pass, or games with DLC that allows DLC-havers to invite DLC-have-nots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, Midnight Murder Club has full cross-play and cross-progression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Velan has also laid out what can be expected through Early Access with a dev diary roadmap:</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club Dev Diary - Early Access Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXZgyRQv16M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">A new PvE mode is planned to release this spring, for example, while the summer will see more Toys added, as well as custom game modes. All of this is subject to change, though, depending on how the game’s community grows and feeds back on what they like and want more of in the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this game Velan Studios is establishing a track record of cooking up new and inventive multiplayer games. A few years ago they launched <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/31/hands-on-the-knockout-city-cross-play-beta/">Knockout City</a>, a quirky riff on dodgeball that was rather fun and vibrant, but sadly didn’t quite find its audience under the EA Originals publishing arm, and couldn’t recover <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/knockout-city-is-going-free-to-play-and-leaving-ea-behind-velan-self-publishing/">after going independent and free-to-play</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">shutting down in 2023</a>. Here’s hoping Midnight Murder Club strikes a cord with more people!</p>
