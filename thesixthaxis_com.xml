		<p>Any game series is going to need to adapt and reinvent itself after a few entries, but few have been quite so transformative as Resident Evil. Through its many sequels and spin-offs, this horror series always keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat.</p>
<p>A big part of horror is building up the anticipation and the scares, to not reveal everything about the monstrosities that are terrifying our protagonists. Capcom took that to heart for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem’s</a> announcement as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At its reveal, there was plenty of mystery about the new leading lady that Capcom had featured. Grace Ashcroft might be an FBI agent, but she’s more of a desk-bound analyst than a field agent. A cruel twist of fate sees her assigned to investigate the Renwood Hotel, the same hotel in which her mother was murdered, dragging her back to Resident Evil’s original stomping ground of Raccoon City.</p>
<p>There’s good reason for this, because<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/"> as Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>So Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, forcing her to evade and hide instead. This was the scene for our hands on preview in the middle of last year, as I guided Grace through dark hallways, looking to reach puddles of light, to keep my noise to a minimum for fear of the hulking beast that was stalking me.</p>

<p>But then comes the twist because… well, why not have Leon in the game too?</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T54OWinnymM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Leon will be featured in Resident Evil Requiem, his story intertwined with Grace’s, letting her handle all the tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action. How nice of him.</p>
<p>One of the great things for Resident Evil Requiem is that, where previous games have made the choice for you, Requiem can be played in both first person and third person from day one –&nbsp;Village added this choice through DLC. The game also looks to push a new generation of the RE Engine that has powered so many of Capcom’s games over the past decade.</p>
<p>Thankfully the wait for this one isn’t too long. Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

		<p>EA’s troubled online only multiplayer action game Anthem has gone offline for good, with EA turning off the servers meaning no Freelancers can take to the game’s skies anymore. There are no plans to add an offline mode to Anthem so it is completely unplayable. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/ea-is-pulling-the-plug-on-anthems-servers-in-2026/">EA did announce it was&nbsp; pulling the plug on Anthem’s servers back in July, </a>so players would get a chance to play it for at least six months before it all got turned off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anthem Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPf-EATqFng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anthem launched on 22nd February, 2019 and was hit with problems from the start with major performance issues, which meant <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/anthems-roadmap-act-1-delayed/">the Act 1 roadmap was been seriously delayed</a>, and BioWare essentially went radio silent as it worked on trying to realise Anthem’s potential. At the time, news was also coming out that there <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/04/bioware-admits-and-pledges-to-address-workplace-issues-after-anthem-expose/">had been issues during the game’s development</a>. It was not a surprise then that game’s first major event, Cataclysm, took six months to appear after launch.</p>
<p>In February 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/10/bioware-reinvent-anthem-ps5-new-seasons-cheap-deal-game-offer-ps4-xb1/">Bioware announced it was going to “reinvent” Anthem</a> with Anthem NEXT, removing seasons but changing the gameplay loop and the whole experience. That never materialised as the world was plunged into the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant development slowed down as countries entered lockdown to contain the virus. The impact of the pandemic and the general slow progress saw EA make the decision to end all <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/24/anthem-next-cancelled-no-more-updates/">further development for Anthem</a>.</p>
