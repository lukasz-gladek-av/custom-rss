		<p>The Witcher has no need for Tinder when journeying across the Northern Kingdoms, when he’s caught in a love triangle between Yenn and Triss. Here, though, he is now trapped in the Tinder-like left and right swiping of Reigns: The Witcher. It’s the second crossover spin-off between Reigns’ kingdom management and a popular fantasy series, but there’s a distinctly different set up to this game than before.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, Reigns: The Witcher stars Geralt of Rivia, but where you’d play as the ruler of a kingdom in the earlier games of this series and have to appease and balance the whims and desires of various factions, now you’re playing as an adventuring hero. It’s quite a shift, though Nerial has stuck with a familiar format. Kind of.</p>



<p>Geralt of Rivia isn’t really the most personable of characters. No, he’s not as monstrous and inhuman as the legends that precede him would have the general people believe, but he still needs a strong PR campaign to be seen as more than just a necessary evil. Enter Dandelion to sprinkle a little musical sparkle across his adventures, turning Geralt into a folk hero over time.</p>
<p>At least that’s the plan. with Reigns: The Witcher wrapping up the adventures within the context of Dandelion performing to a packed house. But telling stories of Geralt’s adventures is pretty tricky. You can find yourself down some unusual rabbit holes, lose the consistent narrative threads, and bend the truth a little too far.</p>

<p>The game opens with his first effort, with talking dragons, captured lovers and Geralt being burnt to a crisp, but it’s just an opening gambit, as each successive adventure leads to Dandelion finding new sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>There’s less of a single narrative thread through each play, as you’re still met by individuals that each present you with a binary choice and an instant resolution to their problem or request. A farmer might ask you to lure in a beast to spook his overly milky goats, a noble could want a particular monster’s head to adorn their mantelpiece, some townsfolk might request your help in warding off a siren living in the woods nearby, or some other mythical beast will need defeating. It seems quite rare that a situation will have a direct narrative follow up or counterpoint, and they’re almost always swiped away and resolved without issue.</p>
<p>That’s generally true when dealing with monsters and creatures too –&nbsp;you can choose to tell the siren to leave or lop off their head –&nbsp;but some will rope you into a new combat minigame that completely shifts the pacing of the game. Instead of letting you take your time, now there’s a beat to match and move to in a block-dropping puzzler.</p>

<p>Geralt roams the bottom edge of a 5×5 grid, moving left or right each beat, and all you can do is guide his direction as enemy attacks, offensive strikes and healing potions descend from the top. It’s tricky to get the hang of and need a good bit of foresight to evade some of the trickier formations that emerge. Take too many hits and it’s game over, with Dandelion having to come up with a better story next time.</p>
<p>Most decisions will have an impact to the performance, pleasing or displeasing humans, non-humans, sorcerers and monsters. The goal, as with previous games, is to keep all four of these in balance. Fall too low and Geralt meets a gristly end. Max one of them out and he’s lured into some hedonistic equivalent. You can find yourself backed into a corner,</p>

<p>You also have some added overarching goals with the inspiration points that Dandelion can draw upon. Three cards are drawn at the start, providing buffs and modifiers to make certain groups easier to please, harder to displease, add a bit of romance, or add a murderous lilt as companions can meet an untimely demise at the hands of monsters. Meeting their requirements, whether it’s flirting with people, finding a serial killer, or something else, then adds to the experience Dandelion gets at the end of a tale and his inspiration.</p>
<p>Reigns: The Witcher is an interesting twist and reframing of the simplified kingdom management series. There’s a lot that will remain familiar, a lightness to how quickly you flit between situations with a simple swipe, and plenty of amusing deaths to find. After a fleeting introductory hour and a bunch of early deaths, I’m curious to see how deep Dandelion’s imagination goes.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released an overview trailer for the addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/virtual-boy-is-joining-the-switch-online-library-but-youll-need-a-stereoscopic-accessory/">Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics</a> on Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, launching on 17th February 2026 alongside the Virtual Boy accessory (both the cardboard model and plastic recreation).</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvaCe4esCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Available as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> membership, Nintendo is rolling in a bunch of the niceties that are common to all the other emulated games in the service. You’re able to rewind the game state if you make a mistake, and you can pause the game to check and modify controller mappings.</p>
<p>Another major feature will be the ability to recolour the games from the red-on-black look that defined this strange era of Nintendo gaming, to having yellow, green, white or potentially more. If using the plastic headset, you’ll have to remove a red colour filter in order for this feature to work.</p>
<p>The seven launch titles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>3-D Tetris</li>
<li>Galactic Pinball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>The Mansion of Innsmouth</li>
<li>Red Alarm</li>
<li>Teleroboxer</li>
<li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming later in 2026 are more games from the catalogue, including two previously unreleased titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>D-Hopper (previously unreleased)</li>
<li>Jack Bros.</li>
<li>Mario Clash</li>
<li>Mario’s Tennis</li>
<li>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</li>
<li>Virtual Bowling</li>
<li>Vertical Force</li>
<li>V-Tetris</li>
<li>Zero Racers (previously unreleased)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Virtual Boy was an ignominious flop in the mid 90s, selling only 770,000 united before being discontinued, though has later come to be appreciated for its bold step toward what has eventually become VR gaming. Part of its failure has to be put down to the technology of the time, so while it offered stereoscopic 3D, it exclusively used red LED lights to render the graphics and give a sense of depth. Additionally, instead of being strapped to your head like a modern VR headset, the Virtual Boy sat on a tabletop mount, providing a fixed view to players of its games and giving an awkwardness to how you engage with the system, no doubt contributing to the headaches, dizziness and eye strain that the system became known for inducing.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s desire to constantly experiment and innovate has seen them return to 3D on various occasions, though. The most famous, of course, was the Nintendo 3DS, which featured an autostereoscopic top screen that could create 3D without the need for glasses. While impressive, the impact of this diminished over time until Nintendo released 2D-only versions of the 3DS. A fun little aside for the Nintendo Labo project on original Switch had a cardboard VR adapter, similar in concept to early VR adapters for phones, where you slot the screened device into a box with lenses to get the same effect. It’s this notion that is being revived for emulating the Virtual Boy in 2026.</p>
<p>It will be really interesting to see if and how this new version of Virtual Boy works.</p>
