		<p>Nintendo has announced that there will be a free update for Pikmin 4, coming in November, and it has released a trailer to confirm what will be present. The main takeaways are a photo mode, Decor Pikmin, and new difficulty levels. In addition, the Pikmin 4 demo will be updated on the same day on the main game’s update release.</p>

<p>In Pikmin 4’s photo mode, you can take pictures anywhere using the Field Camera. This will let you capture moments from the game, and customise those photos with frames and stickers. The world of Pikmin 4 will also see the introduction of Decor Pikmin, which are Pikmin with unique features hiddent around the world. There will be clues present to find them, and when you do you can export them to Pikmin Bloom. Finally, the two new difficulty levels are Relaxed and Fierce. In Relaxed mode, creatures will not attack you unless you attack them first. They will also be easier to defeat compared to normal mode. Lethal mode is for players who want more of a challenge from Pikmin 4, with creatures being more aggressive and harder to take down.</p>

<p>In our Pikmin 4 review, Stefan wrote, <em>“There’s a pleasing mixture of the familiar and the new within Pikmin 4. The fresh camera view and tweaks to the gameplay make it feel more accessible, but for returning players, the focus on the Dandori ethos of planning, efficiency and adaptability provides new arenas to test your skills. Oh, and Oatchi’s a real cutie too.”</em></p>
