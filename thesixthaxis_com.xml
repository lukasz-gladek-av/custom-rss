		<p>The first anniversary for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is upon us next week, and Saber and Focus are marking the moment by revealing the contents of the big anniversary update to the hit Warhammer 40K shooter, and sharing a roadmap for Year 2 of the game’s post-launch support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Update 10 for Space Marine 2 arrives next week on 4th September, and it includes a new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, a new PvP arena, a new Stratagems PvE mode, three new weapons, the Chaos Spawn enemy, and a Chaos armour pack. Phew!</p>
<p>This marks the start of Season Pass 2 as well, which will add the Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack.</p>


<p>But that is just the beginning. The pace of updates will slow from monthly to two a quarter for the year ahead, but the further to the anniversary update we will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 new Operations &amp; a new Siege map</li>
<li>2 new Eternal War arenas</li>
<li>More Stratagems (PvE) content</li>
<li>New playable class: The Techmarine</li>
<li>New weapons and free unlockable weapon variants for existing weapons</li>
<li>New enemies and bosses</li>
<li>New Progression mechanics</li>
</ul>

<p>More fan-favourite Space Marine Chapters will then get representation with he Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons and further cosmetics for the Blood Angels and Salamanders, all bundled into the Season Pass.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>
