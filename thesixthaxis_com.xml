		<p>Surgent Studios has announced that Ben Starr and Neil Newbon will be the lead actors for its upcoming psychological horror game Dead Take. You can see the two actors taking on the role of their respective characters of Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry, who are both voices in the body of Willie.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEIL NEWBON AND BEN STARR CAST AS LEADS IN DEAD TAKE | SURGENT STUDIOS" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Z0_hWpu1pA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ben Starr is best known for playing Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI, a role where he won Best Lead Performer at The Golden Joystick Awards. Neil Newbon most recently won Best Performance at The Golder Joystick Awards and Best Supporting Performance in 2023 for portraying Baldur’s Gate 3’s Astarion. Both actors have had long careers in videogames, so this is a big grab for Surgent Studios.</p>
<p>Dead Take is described as a psychological horror in which you are trying to find your missing friend within a mansion the night after a party. All that awaits in the mansion are USB sticks with partly corrupted files, broken TV sets, a cinema room, and a mystery that needs to be pieced together to figure out what happened to the people who attended the party. A release date is yet to be confirmed for Dead Take which is set to release on PC.</p>

<p>Surgent Studios last game was Tales of Kenzera: Zau, and in our review Adrian said, <em>“Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is an ambitious game, and this kind of endeavour should be applauded and encouraged. Seeking to harness the difficult topic of grief in the form of a Metroidvania was always a big ask. Unfortunately, on this occasion, it proved a challenge that simply hasn’t been met.”</em></p>
