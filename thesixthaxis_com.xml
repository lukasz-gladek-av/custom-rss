		<p>Nintendo finally did the thing! They announced the Nintendo Switch 2 with a suitably quirky little trailer showing the physical differences from the original, and a side dish of new Mario Kart to really get the hype train rolling. It’s going to be a long wait until April, though…</p>

<p>Away from the reviews, I discussed the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal and how <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/the-nintendo-switch-2-reveal-played-it-safe-and-thats-a-good-thing/">playing it safe was probably the right move from Nintendo</a></strong>, even if it’s not as exciting as another paradigm shift. Meanwhile, Dom’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/"><strong>Indiana Jones</strong></a> and thinking of it in terms of the serials that inspired the original films.</p>

<p>Obviously we compile this before the Switch 2 reveal, so there’s no Mario Kart 9 on there. I’d guess it would’ve been third or fourth, otherwise.</p>

		<p>We do love a bit of weekend news, and while you’ve got time on your hands seems like the perfect time to tell you about the brand new demo that’s just dropped for Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero. Arriving for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-hu/product/EP1063-PPSA26644_00-PB2DEMO000000001">PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/phantom-brave-the-lost-hero-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqGPilhvV1owIR0S1qnRWKEtu1NxCuQBVOPzityVKOOSgtLE67-">Nintendo Switch</a> – unfortunately there’s no demo for you PC players – you can now thoroughly bed yourself in with the story for this amazing looking strategy-RPG as the demo will take you through the first two chapters. On top of that, Nippon Ichi have made the categorically correct choice to let your save carry over into the main game. So, what I’m saying is, go and play the start of this game. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero - Demo Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPnqBMRkNow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the sequel to the iconic original, Phantom Brave. Set in Ivoire, a area punctuated by diverse islands. You play Marona, an incredibly cheerful girl, especially considering she can talk to the souls of dead people. Where it comes in handy is that she can interact with Ash, a dead Chroma, or bounty hunter, who used to work with Marona’s parents. He’s now her protector, and together they set out to solve the islands’ problems, via the medium of strategy RPG action. It’s the perfect arrangement.</p>

<p>What’s particularly cool about Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the way it retains the character of the original game, while updating the visuals in a Chibi 3D art style. It’s certainly a great-looking game, with beautiful hi-res character artwork and chunky 3D visuals. Marona finds herself separated from Ash, and instead has to team up with Apricot, the ghost of a pirate ship captain’s daughter. I think you’ll be happily swept up in its ghost-ship centric tale when it launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch on January 30th.</p>
