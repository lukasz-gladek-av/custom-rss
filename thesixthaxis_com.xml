		<p>Hot on the heels of the most recent Steam Next Fest, and just in time for Halloween, here’s a selection of some of the most promising horror titles coming your way over the next few months. This year has already been a strong one for horror with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, whilst I previewed the great <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/becrowned-is-as-close-to-an-old-school-silent-hill-as-you-can-get/">Becrowned</a> a few weeks ago, but the future is looking even more scarily good with these eight games.</p>
<h3>Among Ashes (PS5, PC – December 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Horror Game Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game on this list actually comprises three different gaming experiences in one spooky package. You begin by playing a generic Doom clone on an early 2000s looking PC before your gaming is interrupted by a chat message from a friend telling you about a cursed exe that he has heard about. Once you’ve downloaded this in-game, you then embark on a wonderfully retro first person Resident Evil style adventure. The demo gives a decent amount of gameplay in this second style before closing out by teasing an intrusion into the real space of the player in the game.&nbsp;I’m excited to see how these different levels will interact in the full version.</p>

<h3>Below, Rusted Gods (PC, Q1 2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2895680/Below_Rusted_Gods/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Below Rusted Gods - DEMO AVAILABLE for FREE on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9gGtygCFsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A deeply atmospheric management game where you are the sole radio contact for a group exploring a mysterious passage that has opened up in a research lab. You have to monitor various machines that monitor the team’s progress and give appropriate advice whilst also dealing with strange happenings in the base. The demo feels quite self contained as a short experience so I’m intrigued how a longer version will work.</p>
<h3>Butcher’s Creek (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BUTCHER'S CREEK - Pre-Release Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHYGSdC1x0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This grubby grimehouse first person melee focused game absolutely nails the exploitation vibe and takes clear inspiration from both Condemned: Criminal Origins and Manhunt. You get captured by a snuff film making gang and must bludgeon your way out. Healing requires you to take photos of blood and gore so you have to actually check out your surroundings which is neat. This is looking perfect for fans of Puppet Combo games and their ilk.</p>
<h3>Don’t Fret (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716830/Dont_Fret/"><em>Demo available on Steam</em></a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DON'T! FRET - DEMO ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER | Upcoming Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkCD_dxdNc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m not normally one for mascot horror, having bounced off the original Five Nights franchise, but Don’t Fret is far more of a game than is usual for the subgenre. You play as an anthropomorphic guitar lost in a dark and mysterious musical college that serves as a metaphor for childhood traumas. You must explore, solve puzzles, and avoid the dangerous teaching staff that embody your deepest fears. The soundtrack is produced by a number of prominent YouTube musicians and this plays like a real labour of love.</p>
<h3>Echoes of the Living (PC, 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2173460/Echoes_of_the_Living/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living - Updated Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDq9X0_ldI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bucking the trend for recent Silent Hill inspired titles, Echoes of the Living is a clear homage to vintage Resident Evil. I’ve played several demos of this game over the past few years and it is just getting increasingly more polished and exciting every time. The most recent demo acts as a prologue and introduces you to one of the playable characters, Liam. The game plays out much like an HD upscale of Resident Evil 2 or Nemesis and absolutely nails the look and feel of the genre. Without any hyperbole this is my most anticipated indie horror game.</p>
<h3>Heartworm (2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Heartworm Trailer | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvuFt-JyvQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Probably the most well known title on this list, Heartworm has had a somewhat troubled time in development with publisher difficulties but has now found a home with Dread XP. Completing a trilogy of Silent Hill inspired games alongside Hollowbody and Becrowned, Heartworm embraces tank controls whilst offering both fixed camera and over the shoulder perspectives. You play as Sam, who has lost those she loves and finds herself trapped in a nightmare of ghosts and alternate dimensions. The demo also included a boss fight with a giant spider that shows off how the camera based combat will play out. This looks set to be a new classic of the genre.</p>
<h3>Ritual Tides (PC, Consoles – Q3 2025)</h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ritual Tides - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBt0urULPAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the most mysterious and enigmatic title on this list, as it was only officially announced this week, but has already made quite a stir in horror circles. This will be the first game from Vertpoint Studios, but the team is made up of industry veterans who clearly have ambitious plans. Little is known yet outside of some concept art and the vague description of the player washing up on an isolated island off the coast of Cornwall but the premise and sounds fantastic and the pedigree of those involved is unquestioned. Look out for more details as we get them.</p>
<h3>Sparrow (PC, coming soon)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983920/SPARROW/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPARROW - Gameplay Footage #1 | Sci-Fi Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpNodZgCzaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a complete departure from the nostalgic homages to genre classics, Sparrow is an original and awesome concept for a horror game. You play as a little sparrow looking for your chicks, but are in constant danger from lots and lots of spiders. The main flying mechanics proved to be a little tricky at first in the demo, but that just adds to the challenge. Once you get the hang of them you’ll be pulling off some sweet moves swooping and diving away from predators. The demo ends on a real cliffhanger, by introducing an entirely new type of enemy. The whole thing reminds me of a species switch of the fantastic but forgotten Wii exclusive Dangerous Creatures.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, there you have it, eight incredible horror games to look out for between now and next Halloween. The sheer range and depth of the indie horror scene is fantastic to see and there are many other titles that just missed out on this list. So, whether you want nostalgic survival horror, creepy mascot frights, or entirely new takes on terror, you’ll find something to suit you. And remember, kids, horror games aren’t just for October and can be played and enjoyed all year round!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Being the sixth game in a sub-series of a major franchise that churns out sequels every year, my expectations weren’t particularly high going into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. That’s not to throw shade at Treyarch, but it feels like we reach a point every few years where a particular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> format succumbs to a creeping fatigue, prompting a harsh pivot from the next developer to take the reins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the case with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 – if anything, it’s the best the series has been since Infinity Ward’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/04/modern-warfare-review-ps4-pro-xbox-call-of-duty/">2019 Modern Warfare reboot</a> and, personally, marks my favourite entry since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/05/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-preview/">Black Ops 2</a> launched more than a decade ago.</p>


<h3>Black Ops 6 Campaign</h3>
<p>Even though the series’ timeline is quickly catching up to the contemporary setting of Modern Warfare, Black Ops 6 underlines how very different these two series still are. In this latest single player campaign, Treyarch continues to dip its toes in real-world history – this time it’s the event surrounding the first Gulf War – while also entangling its core cast of characters in a web of conspiracy where it’s never clear who the true enemy really is.</p>
<p>Following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/17/cod-black-ops-cold-war-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Black Ops Cold War,</a> and with our main man Mason out of the picture, players are cast as CIA operative “Case” – a classically silent protagonist flanked by returning favourite, Woods, and veteran Troy Marshall. After a botched extraction mission in Kuwait, and with the emergence of a shady new faction known as Pantheon, the trio is forced underground to root out this hidden threat before it can enact its master plan.</p>


<p>Although Call of Duty has its fair share of memorable characters, they rarely have as much depth as BO6’s ragtag band of rogue ops who are soon joined by the battle-scarred Adler as well as Felix, a pacifist expert engineer, and the wardrobe-swapping assassin, Sev. It’s not necessarily how these characters are written or acted (though the performances here are top notch, especially Y’lan Noel’s Troy Marshall) but rather how you interact with them.</p>
<p>Between missions, Black Ops 6 transports players back to The Rook – a safehouse where they can engage in deeper conversations with their comrades. It’s an unexpected change of pace compared to the usual A to B blitz of older Call of Duty games, and just as in Black Ops Cold War, it works incredibly well here. Not only does The Rook have various secrets to uncover, it’s also where players can purchase permanent upgrades that will carry over from mission to mission. In other words, you become more powerful as the campaign progresses with collectables (wads of money) having actual value.</p>

<p>The overarching story hardly breaks new ground, though is filled by bombastic set piece action and some rather unexpected detours. One level in particular manages to playfully breaks from reality and almost feels like something out of Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, clever level design is an accentuated part of this year’s campaign. While there are still plenty of gunfighting gauntlets to shoot your way through, there are spy-centric, non-combat segments that slot in seamlessly, and while the overall length of the campaign being longer than what fans have become accustomed to, it doesn’t outstay its welcome. Needless to say, this is one of the most memorable and deftly put together campaigns in COD history.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Zombies</h3>
<p>It’s easy to forget that there’s a small, slavering army who come to Call of Duty every year just to play Zombies. What started as a fun bonus mode for 2008’s World at War, it has continued to grow and mutate over the years with its own rich lore and a dense web of gameplay systems.</p>
<p>After last year’s Warzone adjacent effort, Zombies returns to a wave-based format with two maps available at launch (Liberty Falls and Terminus) playable either in solo or co-op for up to four players. As always, the objective is to stay alive as long as possible as incoming waves get tougher, spewing out larger mobs of zombies (and other twisted nightmares) that will relentlessly pursue survivors.</p>

<p>As players gun down enemies they’ll earn the cash and components needed to buy and upgrade weapons, as well as perks, equipment, field gear, and other bonuses to augment their loadout. They’ll also need funds to access other regions of the map, starting in a relatively small location that quickly expands into a winding, zombie-infested maze. As you explore, there’s various secrets to uncover, events to trigger and a story to reveal.</p>
<p>Lifting the gunplay and character movement from the campaign and multiplayer, Zombies has never felt so smooth. It’s easier than ever to outrun and outmanoeuvre basic enemies though they continue to pour out of every crevice, ramping up the tension and forcing you to think about your loadout. Other highlights from this mode include joint-progression with BO6’s competitive multiplayer, as well as the option to exit out of a solo run and then pick back up where you left it later.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>
<p>For almost two decades and across more than a dozen Call of Duty games, I’ve fallen into a pattern of blitzing the campaign first before dabbling in the co-op/bonus game mode, then fully immersing myself in the multiplayer. Like the majority of players, this is where I spend the bulk of my time with each year’s instalment and Black Ops 6 will be no exception.</p>
<p>Since Infinity Ward’s superb Modern Warfare reboot, online gameplay has stuck to a familiar template with small tweaks and changes. Quirks such as being able to reload when aiming down sights and the ability to “mount” cover points are now ingrained in the COD formula, but what party tricks does Treyarch bring to the table? Omnidirectional movement. When this feature was first unveiled it was presented as a game-changing evolution, giving players the power to sprint, slide, and even dive in any direction.</p>

<p>This change will impact diehards plugged into Call of Duty and Warzone all year round, but for it will feel far more subtle for more seasonal fans, as if Treyarch has removed the imaginary sandbags that have been weighing down character movement. The changes feel natural and are easy to grasp, and they do have a knock-on effect when it comes to the tempo of skirmishes and the dexterity needed to outplay opponents in 1-on-1 gunfights.</p>
<p>In terms of content, this is exactly what you want from the Call of Duty multiplayer package: an expansive arsenal of highly customisable weapons and fun killstreaks with plenty of game modes and maps on rotation. Speaking of modes, the new Kill Order is a welcome addition that tasks teams with hunting down enemy HVTs (high value targets) while defending their own. Meanwhile, the twelve original maps offer an intriguing mix of locales that have been meticulously designed to encourage various playstyles, though some are arguably better suited for those who favour long range combat. That’s not to say that snipers will have a hard time wreaking havoc in Black Ops 6 – you just need to be mindful that the increased speed and movement of targets will present a challenge.</p>

<p>It took a dozen or matches, across various modes, for the multiplayer to finally click. That’s nothing out of the ordinary for Call of Duty. It usually takes hours of play until players can start crafting their own preferred loadouts and figure out the meta, and even longer to get acquainted with all the new maps. However, some fans will find it harder than others to adjust to the quicker pace of BO6, the scrappy close-range faceoffs, and wild acrobatics.</p>
