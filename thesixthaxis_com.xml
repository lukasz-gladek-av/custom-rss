		<p>We might be coming to the end of this heatwave, but there’s still a little time to try and enjoy the last of this good weather through this bank holiday. Given that there’s the extra day (once again) to the weekend, there’s still plenty of time for gaming, and I’ve got a big long list of games big and small that I’ll be sinking time into.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>It was a busy old week for video games news, and while we had the gameplay deep dive for Borderlands 4, it was the GTA 6 delay that was the biggest story of the week. Thankfully, there’s still tons of big games for 2025, so it’s not like we won’t have plenty to look forward to through the rest of this year.</p>
