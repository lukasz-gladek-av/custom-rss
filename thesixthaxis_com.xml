		<p>It’s bloody freezing out and about in the UK right now, so I hope you’re all keeping nice and toasty with some added layers, fashionable scarves and silly bobble hats, as needed. But despite the chill over here, the games industry in doing its stretches and warming up for the year. Things are going to start getting really interesting again in the next few weeks, after the slumber that always settles in over the end of year holidays.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been prepping for a house move, so gaming has been limited to just a smidgeon of Astro Bot, which was a Christmas present, and a bit of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm.</li>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong>, meanwhile has been having a blast of nostalgia with RoboCop: Rogue City. The slow movement works for combat, but less so when doing detective work, but it’s really having the authentic likenesses and actors from the original movies represented that does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

		<p>The first full week of the year definitely picked up the pace again, and there’s been plenty of headlines, new trailers and general stuff happening in video games. And there’s also new games coming out sooner than you might think!</p>
<p>I’ve had an old platformer on the go that you’ll hear about next week, and&nbsp;I also played a few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to cobble together a preview video for the game earlier today.</p>
<p>But it’s <strong>Gamoc</strong> who on point for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, and it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">his first impressions</a> that we were able to share in our final preview. He’s really been enjoying it so far, so keep your eyes peeled for our review next month! That’s not all he’s been playing, though. There’s also been some bits of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Black Ops 6, and Terraria with his sister (who’s having to put up with just having a PS4 for the time being).</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> also been playing Kingdom Come… but only the first one – “My enjoyment took a momentary dip during the notoriously dull monastery main quest in which you become a novice monk, performing mundane daily duties while also investigating which of your fellow brothers is a criminal. It was great in terms of historical immersion but was surprisingly punishing. I much preferred my next quest, giving the villagers of Pribyslavitz a good telling off for pooing in the nearby river.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> continuing adventures through The Witcher 3 have taken him through Novigrad, where he’s just picking up quests and some Witcher contracts. He’s also been on the sidelines of Football Manager 24, getting Valencia to the Champions League semi finals, but getting knocked out, meaning he’s just got the slimmest of hopes left for a league win if Real Madrid and Barcelona ever slip up.</p>

<p>There’s been a fair bit of Marvel Rivals for <strong>Jason</strong>, where he’s been having to do an awful lot of carrying as the team healer. Alongside that it’s been Atlyss – &nbsp;“a very enjoyable MMO-style game with some, uh, very specific character models.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> and his wife have reached the final credits of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, so now there’s just all the catching of fishes, bugs and everything else still to do!</p>
<p>While <strong>Dom</strong> was feeling like he was going to be crushed under the sheer weight of a Lenovo Legion Go – he is, after all, a very small person, and it is a large handheld – <strong>Miguel</strong> has been mainlining gacha games including Girls Frontline 2, some Zenless Zone Zero, a pinch of Nikke and a whisper of Honkai Star Rail. Also some Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on PSP!</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> wrapped up and enjoyed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (except for that stupid map), and so has gone back to Another Crab’s Treasure. He also played the first few hours of Alone in the Dark on PS5 and trawled through FromSoftware’s back catalogue to play Ninja Blade on 360 – his PC version is stuck in German, somehow?</p>

<p>And aside from being disappointed by the final act of Destiny 2’s story after The Final Shape, <strong>Tuff’s</strong> been playing “writing a CV” for the first time in 28 years, which is both a new and old experience.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>
