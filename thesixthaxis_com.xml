		<p>There was a brief period of time where the most charitable thing you could say about the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/01/eight-things-that-look-more-like-sonic-than-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie/">Sonic the Hedgehog movie was that Sonic had a face for radio</a>, and maybe that feeling has stuck with the blue blur, because he’s about to feature in the new audio drama Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BftIr01R0uU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A collaboration between Sega and Realm, The Chaotix Casefiles will debut on 27th January 2026. It sees Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee of the Chaotix Detective Agency looking to solve a grand mystery. This will lean on classic detective radio dramas for inspiration.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this is that it will feature a bunch of the regular cast members from the video games, including Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Keith Silverstein as Vector the Crocodile, Matthew Mercer as Espio the Chameleon, Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Charmy Bee, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this story has been put together by director,&nbsp;Ian Jones-Quartey (OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, Steven Universe), lead writer Dan Jolley (Transformers, Dying Light, Superman), and a writers’ room with Ian Flynn and Evan Stanley, who have come from the Sonic franchise. Then there’s new music from two-time Grammy and Tony award-winning composer Charlie Rosen, leader of the 8-Bit Big Band. The production team also brings over thirty years of combined Sonic game development experience to the series.</p>

<p>Realm has been exploring this particular avenue with a number of other adaptations into audio series and podcasts, including Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind, DC High Volume: Batman, and Star Trek: Khan.</p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles is an exciting milestone for the Sonic franchise, allowing SEGA to expand the Sonic universe with a completely new medium,” said Ryan Hamlyn, Senior Director, SEGA Lore &amp; Creative Strategy. “We combined the appeal of a noir detective drama with Sonic’s fun and action-packed style, creating a fresh story that’s both true to the Sonic series and new to fans. Thanks to our collaboration with Realm, listeners can look forward to this immersive mystery adventure anywhere they get their podcasts.”</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with the innovative team at SEGA that oversees Sonic and has successfully expanded the story world in so many ways over the last five years. I can’t wait for fans to be able to dive into the world of the Chaotix Detective Agency – they’re in for an action-packed, sound rich adventure.” said Molly Barton, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Realm.</p>
