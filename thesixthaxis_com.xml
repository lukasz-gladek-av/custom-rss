		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Medieval III, a fresh historical entry in the long-running grand strategy series. So long-running, in fact, that this announcement came for the 25th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Unfortunately, you shouldn’t expect this game to launch especially soon. Total War: Medieval 3 is currently in early pre-production, but the ambition is to create a game that acts as both a tribute to the classic, and as a revolutionary new entry to push it forward.</p>
<p>The press release reads, “Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.”</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the studio also talked about the game engine that they use, revealing Warcore to be the next evolution of their proprietary engine. This will be the new foundation for games and capabilities to be built around, but it’s also been designed with console gaming in mind. Total War will be coming to PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

<p>Medieval: Total War was the second game in the franchise, arriving in 2002 after the original game’s Japanese setting. It was followed four years later by Medieval II: Total War in 2006, so it will have been two decades between games that have visited this tumultuous period of European history.</p>
<p>To be fair, it’s been a good long while since a full fat Total War had a historical setting. Total War Saga: Troy and Total War: Pharaoh were smaller scale experiences, so the last main game would be 2019’s Three Kingdoms. It’s the fantasy wargaming of Total War: Warhammer 3 that arrived most recently in 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the support for that game continues – Total War: Warhammer itself celebrating 10 years – with the Lords of The End Times Pack set to unleash four new Legendary Lords into the Immortal Empires campaign in Summer 2026, alongside an End Times update for free.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/</link>
            <guid>1373320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the curious things you will stumble across early on when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is a lifeless scout bot crumpled to the floor. What does it do? Can it be revived? Where are there more of them? That’s what we’ll set out to answer in this quick guide</p>
<h2>What do Scout Bots do in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Scout Bots are, to put it simply, item locators. Once activated, they will spring into action, marking all of the remaining items within a region on your map for you, so that you can fully power up Samus.</p>
<h2>How can you activate Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Activating a Scout Bot needs you to shoot it with some electrical juice to power it up. This means you need a lightning gun, which is one of the later unlocks for Samus’ new suit of armour in Metroid Prime 4. This is very much a late-game kind utility, for when players have the majority of Samus’ abilities and can actually reach and grab almost all of the items that a Scout Bot will locate.</p>


<h2>Where are all of the Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>There is one Scout Bot located in each region on Viewros, and if you’re attentive as you explore each location, chances are you’ll find all of the Scout Bots. You can make a note of which room and general area they are in using markers on the map (or by making a written note). Or… well, here’s where they all are:</p>
<h3>Fury Green</h3>
<p>Right near the start of the area, you’ll find the Scout Bot in the room branching off from the main path. You really can’t miss it… but you might forget exactly where to go by the time you can activate it!</p>


		
		

<h3>Volt Forge</h3>
<p>The Scout Bot in Volt Forge is tucked a little out of the way down on the side platform of the second generator. That could be quite a chore to get back to, but it’s much easier later in the game.</p>
<p>From the entrance area of Tower 1, head to the elevator opposite the Save Station room. Instead of taking the elevator, scan for a pipe on the right side of the room, which you can rip open using the Psychic Lasso. Hop in as a Morph Ball and this takes you down to the side of the generator of Tower 1.</p>
<p>Use the Psychic Grapple to swing across to the main platform of Tower 1’s Generator, then head straight over to the other side platform and scan for a Psychic Boost Rail. Roll in with the Morph Ball and boost to shoot yourself across to Tower 2’s Generator. Battle the robots here and on the other side platform you will find your Scout Bot. Also… there’s maybe an item near here!</p>

		
		

<h2>Ice Belt</h2>
<p>This one’s super simple. The Scout Bot is off to the side of the frozen wasteland where you have the battle with the pack of wolves. Return here and look to the right and side as you come down the slope to see it.</p>

<h2>Flare Pool</h2>
<p>Another easy to reach one. Drive through the opening area of Flare Pool to reach the shut down bridge and river of lava that you had to cross to reach the main facility. Bike across the lava and head to the right hand side of the maintenance grate. Hop over the bollards and you’ll find the scout bot and a little puzzle to complete once you’ve unlocked the Morph Ball tether.</p>

		
		

<h2>Sol Valley</h2>
<p>Sol Valley’s Scout Bot is pretty handy, given just how big and open space it is! You’ll actually be able to reach the Scout Bot right from where you first land in this region. If you’re coming out of Volt Forge, turn left after exiting the structure and you should see an island just detached from the cliff edge to the world. Activate some Psychic Platforms to jump across and you’ll find the Scout Bot here.</p>

		
		

<h2>Great Mines</h2>
<p>And finally, the Great Mines. I’ll keep things pretty light here, as we’re getting towards the end of the game. See a big spiky green thing? It’s to the left.</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s all of them! With the Scout Bots collected, you’ve still got time for hunting down all the remaining items you have to get Samus fully kitted out for the game’s grand finale. Good luck with that!</p>
