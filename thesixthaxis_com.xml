		<p>What, it’s Friday already? It’s always nice, if a little disorientating to have a bank holiday and a four day week and so rapidly find yourself back at the weekend, where you can chill out, get housework done, and all the rest. Of course, we’ve just been coming out of Easter, which will have given a little bit more time than usual for gaming.</p>
<p>For me, my little time sink has been Into The Breach, the fantastic mini turn-based tactical roguelike from, like, half a decade ago. I remember whiling away a whole Christmas playing it in 2018, and it’s just as good. I’ve also played some other bits and bobs, including the intriguing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/tron-catalyst-preview-glitchy-but-in-a-good-way/">Tron: Catalyst</a> from Mike Bithell and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> gets things started this week by picking off more of the rogues gallery of villains within Assassin’s Creed Shadows, doing a little more cartography and generally progressing through to the game’s conclusion – “Even if the combat and story aren’t massively appealing, the stealth, exploration, and sheer level of beauty to the environments keep me coming back,” he says.</p>

<p>But then Oblivion Remastered released, and he’s suitably impressed. “The ‘remaster’ label may be confusing to some fans as the acclaimed RPG has received more than just a minor facelift. Whole swathes of the game have been improved and reworked while trying to retain that old school Oblivion feel.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the “fantastic” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/promise-mascot-agency-review/">Promise Mascot Agency</a> and the “very good” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-review/">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a> for their respective reviews, as well as more of The Witcher 3, which continues to be “a masterpiece”. He also saved Le Havre from relegation in FM24, while relying on youth players after selling loads of senior figures.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> played a healthy smattering of games that included Hundred Line Defense Academy, Atelier Ryza, Star Overdrive and Unbeatable, and because of all of that has only managed around 20 minutes of Oblivion so far.</p>
<p>Needing something calm and relaxing, <strong>Steve</strong> played Crime Scene Cleaner on Game Pass – “Like an edgelord Powerwasher Simulator but there was something compulsive about putting furniture back in place and cleaning off bloodstains.” He then played the fun but repetitive Patrick Starfish game, and has continued on with his quest to 100% Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, where he’s now chasing blue bricks. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and the Oblivion remake are on his to-play list, but they’ll have to wait until the end of term….</p>

<p>Speaking of which, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been tasked with reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for us, and having a great time with it so far. While there’s great depths to the combat, the visuals and overarching story, his favourite aspect is its quirky sense of humour.</p>
<p>And <strong>Ade’s</strong> still carrying on with Atomfall and really enjoying it. “It’s a little rough around the edges, but I find it’s jankiness rather charming,” he says. “Plus, all the references and nods to Britsh Comics are a delight.”</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>
