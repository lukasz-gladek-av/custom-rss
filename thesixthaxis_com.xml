		<p>Shenmue III is the latest game to be polished up for the current generation of consoles, that being PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and “Nintendo” – presumably Switch 2.</p>
<p>The enhancements are fairly minor, the game never really pushed Unreal Engine, and all you’re getting this time are 4k Textures and “Enhanced Graphics and Performance”. These are not specified but that’s probably because they don’t want to say 4K 60fps when Switch 2 might not manage that.</p>


<p>You also get faster load times, which are entirely due to the game upgrade and not because everyone has a SSD these days. DLSS/FSR Support will be added along with a Classic Camera mode and minor gameplay tweaks. Here’s the full list of improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Graphics and Performance</strong>&nbsp;– Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong>&nbsp;– Refined, more detailed environments and characters.</li>
<li><strong>DLSS/FSR Support</strong>&nbsp;– High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).</li>
<li><strong>Increased NPC Density</strong>&nbsp;– The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.</li>
<li><strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong>&nbsp;– An optional camera perspective inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>, alongside the modern view.</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong>&nbsp;– Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Interactions</strong>&nbsp;– Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded quick-time event timing window for more accessible gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Menu and User&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Enhancements</strong>&nbsp;– Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Optionality First</strong>&nbsp;– All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you own the PS4 or PC version, there will be an upgrade path. A release date for Shenmue III Enhanced has not been announced.&nbsp; There’s no trailer or screenshots either, so here’s a kitten instead.</p>
