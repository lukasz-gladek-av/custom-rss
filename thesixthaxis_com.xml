		<p>Nintendo has announced through its Nintendo Today app that The Legend of Zelda movie will no longer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/">arrive in cinemas in March 2027</a>. Instead, a brand new release date of May 7th, 2027 has been given. The only reason that has been given is that this delay is due to production reasons, and no further information has been provided apart from that.</p>



<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>There are no details of any cast announcements for The Legend of Zelda movie, nor is there any details of what story this movie will have. We do not know if the movie will adapt one of the games or be an original plot, introducing new elements to The Legend of Zelda lore.</p>

		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for July 2025, as well as detailing some of what will happen to mark and celebrate the 15th anniversary of the subscription service, which launched in a very different guise all the way back in 2010.</p>
<p>Let’s not mess about, though. PS Plus this month includes Diablo 4, and two other games, which are…</p>


<p><span>What are the PS Plus July 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>
<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/"><strong>Diablo IV</strong></a> is the headline act here, with Blizzard’s latest action RPG title looking to completely overhaul how it taps into online features, building more of a live game to compliment the moreish loot hunting. There’s been a bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/diablo-iv-season-of-loot-reborn-review/">seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">expansion</a> content added to the game since launch in 2023, but at the time Gamoc said, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/15/king-of-fighters-xv-15-review/"><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong></a> revived the long-running fighting game series, back in 2022. SNK’s storied series had gone pretty quiet through the previous decade, but came back with a hefty punch. Dom said in our review, “King of Fighters XV marks an excellent return for the series, modernising it at nearly every turn. While we await a story that’ll finally do justice to the characterful roster, it stakes a claim to SNK’s past with an eye firmly on the future.”</p>

<p>Alas, we have no review of Jusant to draw upon, but Don’t Nod’s climbing game was certainly fascinating to see developed and released. It’s both an action-puzzle climbing game where you try to clamber up the side of a huge tower, but it’s also a meditative journey because of this, with secrets from a lost civilisation to uncover.</p>
<h2>What’s happening for the PS Plus 15th Anniversary?</h2>
<p>Sony has pulled together a bunch of new game trials for PS Plus Premium members, some special offers, exclusive Valorant content, and PS Tournaments. Oh, and a free weekend!</p>
