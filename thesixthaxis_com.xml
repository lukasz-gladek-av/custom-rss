		<p>Capcom has announced that is doing a collaboration with K-pop group Aespa, along with virtual idol Naevis. The collaboration with Aespa will consist of a new outfit for Juri which will release on July 4th. This outfit will be only be available for a limited time, with that timeframe being a year. After that it will be gone. You can see the the outfit and hear some of Aespa’s Whiplash track in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Naevis is a virtual idol that began as a sidekick for the group Aespa, before being spun off to be a solo artist. Naevis’ has been confirmed as a real time commentator. It is worth mentioning that being a virtual idol means that Naevis is not a real person, and has been created using generative AI. The option to use Naevis as a real time commentator in Street Fighter 6 will also be available from July 4th.</p>

<p>In our Street Fighter 6 review, Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that prices of original Nintendo Switch systems and associated products in Canada will change on 1st August 2025, “based on market conditions.” The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> line up is unaffected.</p>
<p>While they don’t say so in quite so many words, the implication is that prices are rising for the previous generation of Nintendo console – they wouldn’t pre-announce a price drop like this.</p>


<p>This looks like a full readjustment of pricing in Canada, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">Nintendo Switch – OLED Model</a>, Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/nintendo-switch-lite-review/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, physical and digital Nintendo Switch games and Nintendo Switch accessories. Amiibo and Nintendo Switch Online will also see price changes.</p>
<p>A lot of this could be put down to the fallout from trade wars and disputes with Canada’s closest neighbour, the United States of America. Since the start of the current administration, Canada has repeatedly tussled with Trump over tariffs, with new levies being announced, paused, pulled back, reannounced and more. That’s in addition to the global tariffs that Trump put in place as well. This uncertainty has had a huge impact on pricing around the world, but while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">Sony</a> announced price increases earlier this year, Nintendo has avoided making similar changes in the run up to the Switch 2’s launch – not least because of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">how much criticism they took</a> over pricing the new console, games and upgrades.</p>

<p>Could this herald more price increases for other countries? Certainly, and we’ll just have to wait and see what these price changes actually end up being.</p>
