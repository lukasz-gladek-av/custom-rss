		<p>Valve has released details and content for Deadlock with the major new update called Old Gods, New Blood bringing with is a new 4v4 Street Brawl mode, new bosses and patrons that fall into the camps of the Hidden King and Archmother, and lots of updates. There are also six new heroes coming to Deadlock with two released per week, with the release order determined by community votes.&nbsp;The six new heroes have just three phrases to describe each of them, and they are as follows:</p>

		
		

<ul>
<li>Silver – Feral, Hot Mess, Transformation</li>
<li>Rem – Tiny, Helpful, Zzz</li>
<li>Graves – Morbid, Aerial Denial, Necromancer</li>
<li>Celeste – Performer, Disruptive, Dazzling</li>
<li>Venator – Devout, Arms Expert, Tactical</li>
<li>Apollo – Finesse, Mobility, A Cut Above</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Street Brawl mode is a fast paced 4v4 mode where players duke it out in a best of five format with rounds just taking a couple of minutes. At the start of the match, players can pick three random items to add to their inventory, and everyone starts each round on the same level with no farming. The post game screen and MVP system have also been updated so it is easier to get the information you want. Valve has also looked at additional UI and settings improvements which include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Reactive Portraits – Your hero portrait changes based on how you are doing in game.</li>
<li>Kill Streaks – Show off your hot streak</li>

<li>Random Hero Button</li>
<li>Rejuv Duration Time – More easily track the rejuv timer before it expires.</li>
<li>Visibility Outlines – Improved readability for players and structures during gameplay.</li>
<li>Hole Punch View – A new Camera Hole Punch system reduces the amount of unexpected camera movement when running in front of obstructions. The camera will peer through the objects instead of pushing toward the player character.</li>

		<p>Nintendo has revealed a new physical product, making the Talking Flower from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> into something you can plonk on your sidetable and have quip away at you all day, every day (unless you tell it to stop).</p>
<p>Launching on 12th March, the Talking Flower is now available to pre-order from Nintendo and retail partners, priced at £24.99 / $34.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Talking Flower – Coming March 12th" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlPHrDkoukM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Talking Flower will spout out somewhat random quips throughout the day, set by default to say something ever 30 minutes, and able to be manually triggered with a press of the Talk Button. It’s just about smart enough to be able to announce the hour (but will sometimes get it wrong and then correct itself, which is actually marginally more intelligent than the self-assured ChatGPT). It can also comment on the time of day and temperature, and will sometimes play background music from the game (you can then mash the Talk Button and it’ll shout and yelp to match the music).</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can get it to shut up. Hold the Talk Button for two seconds and it will halt its chit chat, and you can set a sleep schedule so that it doesn’t disturb you. It also has support for English, German, French, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Chinese and Korean localisation.</p>

<p>It’s another thoroughly odd little bit of Nintendo merch, to go alongside their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">Alarmo alarm clock</a> from a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Chances are most people will stick with just playing the game. Super Mario Bros. Wonder was a real highlight for the Nintendo Switch, bringing a renewed sense of fun and imagination to the 2D side-scrolling platformer, and Nintendo are now expanding it for Nintendo Switch 2 with a Switch 2 Edition and Bellabel Park add-on. They just delved into the various multiplayer modes and added challenges that will be making their way into the game on Switch 2 when it launches in March, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-arrives-in-march-with-playable-rosalina-more/">read all about that here</a>.</p>
