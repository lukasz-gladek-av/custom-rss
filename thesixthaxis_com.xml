		<p>Artefacts Studio and New Tale have announced the first videogame adaptation of Fantasy Flight Games’ Descent board game, with this first game being Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent. The story of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent will be a new one, and not based on the board game so it will be something new for fans of Descent, as well as an entry point for those who have not played Descent before.</p>

<p>Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent takes place one year before the events of Descent: Legends of the Dark, adding to the lore of the world while introducing new events. The gameplay will be a turn based RPG along with exploring different dungeons with a group of heroes. Additionally, players can choose to play through the entire campaign or play through self contained questlines outside of the main story that can be completed in a few hours. Both the story campaign and standalone quests can be played solo or in co-op.</p>
<p><em>“As fans of Descent, stepping into Terrinoth has been both a huge responsibility and an incredible joy,”&nbsp;</em>said Bruno Chabanel, CEO of Artefacts Studio.&nbsp;<em>“With Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent we wanted to capture the feeling of a tense tabletop dungeon crawl and translate it into a tactical RPG that flows naturally on PC and consoles with a multiplayer cooperative mode to accurately convey the atmosphere of the board game. It’s easy to pick up, but there is always another strategy, another synergy or another build to discover.”</em></p>

<p>There is a demo available on Steam to try out what Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent has to offer ahead of its planned release this Spring for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Supermassive Games has announced a new release date for their upcoming The Dark Pictures horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a>. The sci-fi scarer will launch on 12th May 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC with pre-orders now available.</p>
<p><iframe title="COMPLY." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer gives another glimpse into the decision-making and the absence of trust you might feel while playing Directive 8020. With the ship’s crew facing an alien threat that can morph into and inhabit their forms, you can’t trust that anyone is who they say they are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cooper, the ship’s medic, features in this trailer, having to make a decision about whether to let their crewmate Mitchell through a sealed door. However, previous decisions could reshape this situation, so that Cooper and not Commander Stafford has a gun, and when faced with two identical versions of Engineer Cernan, you’ll have to decide which one is real.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows more of Brianna Young (played by Lashana Lynch), who’s the real lead of the tale, and gives a very first look at on-planet gameplay as the ship reaches Tau Ceti f.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A new feature for the series is Turning Points, which allows you to more easily rewind and revisit key moments in the story. This will allow for completionists to explore narrative branches, or for regret-filled players to go back and undo fatal mistakes, but there is still a survivors mode that removes this safety net and makes every death permanent within a playthrough.</p>
<p>Directive 8020 will launch first with single player and up to 5-player couch co-op, while online multiplayer will be coming in a free post-launch update sometime later.</p>
