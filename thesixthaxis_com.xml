			<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> launched, Kazutaka Kodaka joked that his studio Tookyo Games might go bankrupt if the game didn’t do well. Thankfully, the massive visual novel experience ended up doing so well he later clarified that the team no longer felt that bankruptcy was a possibility. Despite that, it felt like it might take a miracle for the team to be able to put out another game if they were so close to shuttering after completing this one. As it turns out, Kazutaka Kodaka treated us like the victims in his own infamous twist-filled mystery thriller games. He quickly announced the development of a new game alongside DMM Games and Spike Chunsoft where the gimmick is that it is actually five different games in one – and that smorgasbord title is called Shuten Order.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHUTEN ORDER Gameplay Intro Trailer (Nintendo Switch, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLlfmevjGAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I loved&nbsp;The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;a lot, it felt all too familiar as a fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;series. Perhaps that’s because it shares so much of a visual and auditory identity with those games. Perhaps it’s because the game kicks off with all-too-familiar mysteries of locked classrooms and quirky teens that it drags it’s feet expanding into truly original ideas. None of it was bad, just familiar.&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;by comparison, is a revelation.</p>


<p>It finally feels like Kazutaka Kodaka is doing something fresh and new with this game, and there’s a lot of reasons for that. For one, the entire plot setup is refreshingly unique – our protagonist wakes up in a mysterious hotel room with no memory of their identity or their past. Two self-proclaimed angels tell her that she has been murdered, but they placed her in a new temporary body and have given her the alias of Rei with the goal of completing “God’s trial”. The task? Interrogate five key members from a mysterious organization known as Shuten Order, discover which of them is our killer, then get them to confess. Oh, and kill them too.</p>


<p>In the opening hours of&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;layers of dubious explanations and hauntingly under-explained world details are stacked on top of each other at a staggering rate. Before you can even question who these angels are if they’re real, you’re also grappling with learning that you live in a city-state founded by a religious cult – then, before the dubiousness of that can even sink in, it’s hinted that the world outside of this mini-country is a literal apocalypse. Despite the ominous circumstances of the game’s world, the streets are lined with confetti and festival banners celebrating the heroes of the Shuten Order. A cutscene shows you the celebrations playing out, but the cacophony quickly goes from just loud to overbearingly chaotic – voices and cheers and sounds overlap in an overwhelming, barely decipherable mess.</p>
<p>There’s a really hauntingly beautiful sort of cluttered chaos to the entire aesthetic of the game that is unlike anything else I’ve seen. Stylish title cards outlining the day and time explode onto the screen regularly, and when your protagonist uses the mysterious “power of God” to make unexpected miracles or coincidences occur, a terrifying animatic of inhuman language and shapes and sounds pops onto screen that seems to represent some kind of representation of whatever god is helping you. Most of the game is represented by talking character portraits and subtly stylised text boxes that look like a regular video game, but when these alarming animatics pop in, it really adds to this sense of urgency and strangeness that elevates the game so much.</p>

<p>Your guardian angels prompt you to pick one of the five leaders of the Shuten Order to identify as your killer – the implication is that your choice is guided by divine will, and whoever you pick&nbsp;is&nbsp;the killer. Whoever you pick also dictates an entirely different gameplay experience you’ll be going through as you investigate their secrets and hunt their confession. Kishiru Inugami makes you play an Ace Attorney-style investigation game. Yugen Ushitora has you playing an all-too-familiar death game escape adventure. Teko Ion’s route takes the form of a flowchart-exploring non-linear visual novel.&nbsp;Honoka Kokushikan’s route is a high-stress twist on a dating sim visual novel. Most striking of all, though is Manji Fushicho’s story – which isn’t a 2D visual novel genre-spin at all, but instead a fully 3D top-down stealth horror game.</p>
<p>I started off with Honoka Kokushikan’s route, intrigued by the idea of a romantic adventure, but I was initially disappointed by how it felt identical to the base game. Characters joke about how “different” the world looks once you step into her route, but all that’s really changed is that your text boxes are a slightly different shape. Thankfully, over the course of her 6-ish hour route, a lot of unique gameplay ideas start to crop up and you’re given a satisfying amount of freedom to explore the weirdness of the route. Each of the five routes clocks in at a similar length of time, and they all do a surprisingly good job of fully committing to their bits and giving you a full-games worth of mechanical depth and mix-ups. About half the routes feel whole enough in terms of narrative to come across as their own intriguing little mystery games, but the other half are so clearly part of a larger puzzle and don’t fully stand up on their own. Special shout-out to Yugen Ushitora’s escape-room route, because it’s inexplicably formatted like a vtuber livestream with a 3D anime girl reacting to everything in the corner while her chat pops off above her head.</p>

<p>As a complete experience, Shuten Order does unfortunately fall into a very similar trap as a lot of other works by Kazutaka Kodaka – there are really fascinating ideas and twists presented in the game, but character dialogue is so overbearing in repeatedly explaining and clarifying every interaction that it feels like this sometimes-exhausting 50 hour experience could have been a much swifter, snappier, and more satisfying 30-35 hour adventure. Like his other games though, the sheer creativity and one-of-a-kind aesthetic in this game ends up making the sometimes mind-numbing dialogue worth digging through. Shuten Order blends quiet tension with loud and anxiety-inducing frights perfectly without ever even acting like it’s a horror game. It isn’t, except for that one route where it is. It’s just an amalgamation of overwhelming sights and sounds that’s equal parts beautiful and confusing. It’s an uncompromising experience, and one I won’t forget for a long time.</p>

		<p>Valve has announced a new process for validating the age of users and comply with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/welcome-to-the-new-internet/">UK’s controversial Online Safety Act</a>. Thankfully, Valve’s path to confirm your age is much less intrusive than the one we’ve seen many social media companies and tech giants taking.</p>
<p>From now on, UK-based users looking to visit Steam store pages for mature rated games and their community hubs will require you to be logged into an active user account and opt-in for mature content. This does mean there’s no more blindly clicking through a quick date picker without logging in, which was useful for casually browsing.</p>


<p>Of course, this will now need a new process to verify a user’s age, and in the UK your age is considered verified so long as there is a valid credit or debit card stored on the account – while Valve stated “credit card”, banks issue different debit cards to customers who are above and below 18 years of age and perform age and identity checks for their accounts, so they should still provide the same age checks in this process.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to AI-based age guesstimation using phone cameras – some of which were initially fooled by the photo mode in Death Stranding – or demands for passport and drivers licenses to validate. Steam is a storefront, so it’s reasonable to expect a payment method for validation. As excessive as the legislation is, both for the demands being imposed on companies, users and online communities and for the dampening effect this has on important kinds of speech and knowledge, this is a relatively low key approach from Valve.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shame that other options are not available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/xbox-adds-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-the-online-safety-act/">Age verification on Xbox is to be fully enforced from early 2026</a>, and you can prove your age using government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, or credit card checks. I’d like to see Valve add mobile checks as well – you need to provide a phone number as part of adding a credit card anyway, and that’s also a decent datapoint.</p>

<p>Valve commits to processing this data in a manner that is identical to their rest of its data processing for purchases and payments, using an internal payment processing system that meets PCI-DSS standards. If, however, your given card fails the age check, you will need to contact your bank and go through a Steam support process.</p>
<p>Here’s the process for Steam users to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Steam user account.</li>
<li>Visit the Account Details page and click the button labeled “Add a Payment method to this account”.</li>
<li>You will be redirected to a form where you are asked to enter your credit card details.<br>
Required inputs:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card type</li>
<li>Credit card number</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>Expiry date</li>
<li>Name and billing address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click “Continue” to trigger a £0 authorization.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a challenge that is determined by your card issuing bank’s policies, e.g. via one-time-password (OTP) or via app.</li>
<li>If the process is successful, you can now choose to add previously unavailable mature content types on the Store Preferences page.</li>
</ol>

		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Teaser Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ti8cwDNGxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>
