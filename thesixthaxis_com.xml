		<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is launching on 16th October 2025 for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced.</p>
<p>The company also confirms that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Switch 2 Edition, which brings improved graphics and frame rates, will be available as a higher priced version of the game. Those who buy the Nintendo Switch version of the game, both digital or physical, will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition. Curiously, it seems that the Switch 2 version is compatible to Switch, which I’m not 100% sure how this will work with the physical edition.</p>


<p>Here’s TPC’s specific wording:</p>
<p><em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the Nintendo Switch 2 title Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be available. With the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you can enjoy improved graphics and frame rates.</em></p>
<p><em>If you own the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, you can upgrade it to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by purchasing an upgrade pack, whether you own the digital version or the physical version of the software. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch system. When playing the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on Nintendo Switch, the content will be the same as that of the Nintendo Switch software. Additional content that utilizes the specs of Nintendo Switch 2 will not be included.</em></p>

<p>No pricing details have been announced at this time, but paid upgrades of this scope – namely Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a £8 / $10 price difference</a>.</p>
<p>The second Legends spin-off after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Arceus</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes us back to Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y. The city is undergoing a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. This means there’s Wild Zones within the city where Pokémon are allowed to thrive behind locked gates… until pesky trainers of a high enough level stomp in and start chucking Poké Balls at everything that moves and fighting them!</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-brings-real-time-battles-and-mega-evolutions-coming-late-2025/">Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y</a> with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-more-dangerous-after-dark-with-the-z-a-royale-battles/">a day-night cycle</a>, with things getting much trickier after dark. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>
