		<p>Naming your game after one of the tastiest foodstuffs on the planet is one way to strike a tone. Named after the beautiful Indian pancakes you’ll find at the best street food markets, it’s immediately clear that tasty treats lie at the very heart of Dosa Divas. That said, the colourful wrapper created by Outerloop Games is hiding something even more delicious inside.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOSA DIVAS - Release Date Trailer - Steam Demo Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bogYlMcNb80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There aren’t many games that give you the option to pout, photo modes notwithstanding, but that’s exactly what we found during the opening of our hands-on with Dosa Divas. We’re pouting because our sister Amani refuses to cook us some food, and once she gives in, that’s our first quest here. Collect some ingredients. The difference in Dosa Divas is that we’re going to do it in a mech.</p>


<p>It’s one heck of a mech, too. Goddess has the front end of a yellow Tuk Tuk, an old-school folding canopy, and at least one stick-on paper flower. It’s awesome. AND, it flaps its arms like a chicken to double jump. You can forget Gundam; this is the coolest mech of 2026.</p>


<p>Samara and Amani are the Dosa Divas, former restaurateurs turned Spirit-mech pilots, and who are able to enter the Preparation Realm to craft food and consumables through a series of mini-games. You select the ingredients – that’s a Bell Pepper here for the base, before added Basil for flavour. The pronunciation of “bay-zil” upsets me, but that’s the only wrinkle in an otherwise fun and tasty diversion.</p>
<p>The pair are about to set off on a road trip to see their parents – their first after Amani has been away for ten years – before they’re rudely interrupted by their other sibling, Lina, and her floating LinaMeals food billboard. Which she uses to insult the pair. Sam smashes the billboard up, and between that and a spot of sulking, it’s clear that a lot has happened, both in the last ten years, and between the sisters.</p>
<p>Perhaps most obviously, Lina has become a food-based overlord, controlling the populace with her LinaMeals and banning everyone else from actually cooking. She’s even got lawyers out and about to make sure everyone follows her rules. Fortunately, Samara and Amani aren’t about to let that stand, with a spot of turn-based combat coming into play whenever you’ve got someone standing in your way.</p>

<p>This is turn-based combat in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Expedition 33</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, rewarding extra damage or defence if you can time the right button press with the action on screen. I really think that this has become my favourite feature in turn-based games, keeping you on your toes and giving you some much-needed interaction during battles.</p>
<p>The culinary influence continues into combat, whether that’s Sam using a massive Karahi wok to pummel enemies or needing to match your attacks to the enemies’ food weakness. There’s a handy readout like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/octopath-traveler-0-review/">Octopath Traveller</a>, so you can easily remember that they’re weak to spicy or sour attacks, and just like Octopath, there’s also a boost function that lets you add extra attacks to your chosen action. It all comes together really well, and if you’re a fan of modern turn-based combat, Dosa Divas is doing it right.</p>

<p>Dosa Divas also looks and sounds absolutely brilliant. Its chunky, vibrant art style brings bags of character to the world, and everyone in it, with a real penchant for slightly off-kilter food-based visual gags and details. That’s all ramped up by funky, rock-infused riffs that are melded with more traditional Indian tones. The exceptional vibes are less surprising when you find out it’s coming from Outerloop Games, the Washington-based, minority-led team behind the incredible Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, and they’ve brought that same spirit to bear on Dosa Divas.</p>
<p>There aren’t many games that immediately lodge themselves in your psyche in the way that Dosa Divas has. Perfectly struck turn-based combat, killer art direction, and a sibling rivalry that’s enslaved the world set the tone for what looks to be one of 2026’s most intriguing indie releases.</p>
<p><em>Dosa Divas is launching on 14th April across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 1 &amp; 2 and PC, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4316300/Dosa_Divas_Demo/">check out a demo now on Steam</a>.</em></p>
