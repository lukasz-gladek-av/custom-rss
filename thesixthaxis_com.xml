		<p>Netmarble has announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released on May 21st for PC and mobile devices. This Game of Thrones title puts you in the boots of the heir to House Tyre, a small noble House from the North. You are instructed by Jon Snow to travel around Westeros to rally the Great Houses and the lords of the realm to fight against the White Walkers.</p>

<p>Dom spent some time earlier this year playing Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and in his preview he said, <em>“The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos. Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes.”</em></p>

<p>As mentioned in Dom’s preview, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be a free to play title, though people can buy founder’s packs to play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/"> the early access version of the game</a> on PC via Steam.
