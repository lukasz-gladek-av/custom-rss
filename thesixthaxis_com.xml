		<p>Embark has revealed what’s coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another. There’s a new Cold Snap map condition to endure, and Flickering Flames to warm you up when you get back to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flickering Flames Winter Event | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdGMteCqknE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cold Snap is a new map condition from 16th December, as brutal cold and blizzard can roll in and force you to approach scavengine missions in a different way.</p>
<p>Embark say, “The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.”</p>
<p>And with the difficulties above, Speranza is also having to endure food scarcity and rolling blackouts by gathering in candle light and sharing what little they have. Flickering Flames is the name for this event, which runs from 16th December through 13th January.</p>

<p>You’ve got two new major goals when heading above the surface, looking to gather the Candleberry Bush which sustains the city through the winter, and also light and heat sources to boost morale.</p>
<p>Candleberries and light and heat special items will be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li value="1">Raider Tokens</li>
<li value="2">New items</li>
<li value="3">Rare utility items</li>
<li value="4">Weapons</li>
<li value="5">Cosmetics</li>
<li value="6">Merits</li>
</ul>

<p>And then, as a Christmas treat, the second free and permanent Raider Deck is coming to the game on 26th December. This is a string of items to unlock, Raider Tokens and cosmetics,, building up to the hockey-inspired outfit and hockey stick “tool” of The Goalie.</p>

			<p>As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets. When Sleep Awake was first announced, the names involved left me anticipating a thrilling and subversive narrative backed up by a thumping industrial soundtrack. The actual game we got certainly ticks those boxes to some degree, but is it another success story for Blumhouse Games after the excellent Fear The Spotlight?</p>
<p><iframe title="Do. Not. Sleep... SLEEP AWAKE is Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gogkM13Cqcc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developers Eyes Out state on their website that they “believe in a powerful synaesthesia emerging from music, narrative, and interactive experiences,” and this manifesto perfectly explains the nature of Sleep Awake. Mixing traditional first person exploration with surreal live action cutscenes, and with all the action being accompanied by a superbly varied and atmospheric score, Sleep Awake takes the ‘walking simulator’ and makes it far more cinematic in scope and feel. It feels strange that this title hasn’t been released on VR devices to be honest. Regardless, it is essential that you play this through decent headphones if you can.</p>


<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a strange world that has been ravaged by the Hush, a mysterious presence that steals away anybody who falls asleep. The few remaining survivors of this nocturnal apocalypse must find new ways to stay awake by whatever means necessary, but different sects have very different ideas of how to do this. You play as Katja, a young girl who uses combinations of herbs to concoct eyedrops to stave off tiredness whilst other groups prefer pain and/or bodily mutilation to achieve the same goal. Your first actions in the game are to find the herbs around your flat in order to make such a tincture, a tutorial section that works well to immerse you into the game’s world. Once you have made the drops you set out to deliver them to Amma, and then the strangeness really begins.</p>


<p>At times, Sleep Awake is visually stunning with neon drenched skylines and dingy, dilapidated buildings at ground level. Other areas feel a little more repetitive but there isn’t much backtracking so the game is always pushing you forward to see new things. Enemies are present but act as moving obstacles rather than antagonists with their presence mostly restricted to several scripted chase sequences and thankfully short stealth sections. The vibe here is very much that of a walking simulator with occasional horror and puzzles to mix things up.</p>
<p>The narrative in Sleep Awake is mostly relayed through environmental storytelling (and Katja’s frequent monologues in response to said environment) but there are also microfiches to find that reveal some of the backstory and lore of the world. There are also spiritual echoes called void shadows left by some taken by the Hush. Katja is able to tap into these shadows and reveal the trapped memories within. Whilst it is never really explained &nbsp;how she is able to do this, the latter parts of the game point to some kind of family connection to the Hush, a connection that is clearly foreshadowing for future entries in the Sleep Awake universe.</p>
<p>This points to one of the most divisive aspects of the game – it feels very much like the prologue to a greater story and, as such, is quite a short experience. I took my time and found almost every collectable and still didn’t get to the five hour mark.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here, I’m not arguing that games have to meet a minimum number of hours to be considered worthwhile (indeed I’ve given high scores to many shorter and more focused titles) but the story here feels like it stops just as it starts to get going. The pacing within those five hours is a little uneven as so much happens towards the end that the game before it feels more like an opening chapter. I hope that Blumhouse support Eyes Out to continue the story but recent experiences in the world of game development leave me apprehensive.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There's a lot of promise to Sleep Awake, which makes its short runtime all the more frustrating.&nbsp;The fusion of visuals, music, and narrative are reminiscent of peak Remedy titles and the inevitable cliffhanger ending definitely leaves me wanting to find out more about Katja’s story. I’ll be listening to that Robin Finck soundtrack in the meantime and crossing my fingers.	</p></div>

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-revealed-by-larian-studios-who-probably-watched-the-wicker-man-recently/">Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards</a> (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-could-be-imminent-following-sequel-announcement/">some rumours swirling</a>), Larian Studio has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2 –&nbsp;Definitive Edition</a> is now available on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with free upgrades for existing owners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Now Available On Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, &amp; PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Larian’s original fantasy setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was an acclaimed sequel to the studio’s turn-based RPG revival through the 2010s – a revival that eventually led to the even more acclaimed and beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>!</p>
<p>While Larian hasn’t dug into the technical details, you can expect that this upgraded release will offer improved resolutions and frame rates compared to the game on original Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. There was already support for 4K on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but native versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S should allow for 60fps.This isn’t a remake or remaster, just a fairly simple port.</p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now simply a cross-buy PS5 and PS4 game – i<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP3383-PPSA06866_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5">t’s also on sale for £12.49</a> right now!</li>
<li>On Xbox One and Series X|S the game is now cross-gen – <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6">it’s on sale for £14.52</a> currently.</li>
<li>On Switch 2, however, you’ll want to head to the Nintendo eShop and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2988295.html">search for the free upgrade pack</a> if you own the game on original Switch. The RRP is £44.99 for the game on Switch 2, but <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Definitive-Edition-1633057.html">you can currently buy the Switch 1 edition for £22.49</a> and then upgrade for free, so…. uh…. go and do that instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>While free in most locations, Japan has a nominal ¥100 fee on Switch and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>
