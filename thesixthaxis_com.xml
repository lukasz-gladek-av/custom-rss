		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>

		<p>WWE 2K23’s servers have now been shut down, with 2K sunsetting all online functionality for the wrestling game. This means, currently, the only WWE game with online functionality is WWE 2K24, which was released in March 2024. WWE 2K23 was released in March 2023, meaning the online functions of the game lasted less than two years. The game had already been removed from digital storefronts on November 1st, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Even Stronger  | WWE 2K23 Official Showcase Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LRreShTggQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its announcement about the WWE 2K23 server closures, 2K wrote, <em>“WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued.This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point, however if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/29/wwe-2k23-review/">WWE 2K23 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our WWE 2K23 review, Adrian said, <em>“As a wrestling fan, I want to create five-star classic matches, with back-and-forth action, near falls, and iconic moments, but ultimately WWE 2K23 cannot facilitate that. Messy and overly complicated controls hamper those efforts, but it’s 2K’s obsession with players winning matches that ensure this professional wrestling game misses the point entirely.”</em></p>

<p>This server shutdown follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/nba-2k23-has-now-been-delisted/">NBA 2K23’s servers</a> being taken offline on December 31st, 2024, after being delisted from digital storefronts at the end of November. This is standard practice for 2K, as the company turns off servers it’s big sports games only a couple of years after release to focus on the latest titles.</p>
