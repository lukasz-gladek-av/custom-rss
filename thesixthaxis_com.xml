		<p>I hope you’ve all had a lovely Christmas break and are thoroughly refreshed for the year ahead, because we’ve doubtless got some serious gaming to get up to! But what did we all get up to over the holidays? Were there any big new games under your decorated spruce?</p>
<p>Swanning off to visit family, I made sure to pack the Switch 2 for my gaming time. I made a start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>… and then made another start because I quit the game during a cutscene and hadn’t hit the first save point. I duelled other in the micro retro gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. I scrolled through the eShop sale and snagged Fast Fusion. But the main thing I played was actually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. While I’ve often made a start on this classic for its rereleases and remasters on Wii U and Switch, I’d never made it past the second or third cluster of galaxies. So, it was high time to fix that, and I’m now on the cusp of the final showdown to rescue my “special one”, as Rosalina keeps calling them.</p>
<p>I assume Rosalina means it’s Jose Mourinho? But I’ll find out this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> making a start to 2026 with his first review of the year, and it’s the charming and ambitious platforming adventure Big Hops. This was featured in the Day of the Devs stream last year, but to keep an air of mystery, I won’t tell you which kind of hopping animal you play as.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> body is now ready for both a new D&amp;D campaign –&nbsp;he’s made a “silly build” –&nbsp;and for the next Genshin Impact patch. While he waits for both of those, he’s letting his Megabonk obsession carry him through to a score of 200,000… or at least that’s his plan.</p>
<p>We’re amongst gaming royalty, as <strong>Ade</strong> has made it up to Gold Tier 3 in Marvel Rivals – OK, so I’m stretching that definition pretty far, but he’s dead chuffed with himself. Alongside that, he’s been playing a shoot ’em up puzzler called Popucom with Laura for an upcoming review.</p>
<p>And speaking of his better half, <strong>Laura</strong> has continued to dive into the creepiness of Silent Hill f, which she’s pronouncing ‘fffffffff’. She’s also still tending to her dinosaur park in Jurassic World Evolution 3, but is starting to run up against the boundaries of the simulation and is being told her park is too big!</p>

<p>It’s mostly been our Game of the Year winner Ghost of Yotei for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, alongside Borderlands 4, and some Warriors: Abyss thrown in for good measure. His general verdict? “They’re all great.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> tells us that, “In keeping with the festive spirit I played through the ultra bleak and depressing Total Chaos which was great for a game that began life as a mod for Doom II. I’ve balanced that with some family Guitar Hero and Rock Band 3 evenings on Wii (through the WiiU) – even getting to try out the keyboard for the latter. Kids now want me to get Clone Hero sorted out for PC. Finally I started Lost Records Bloom and Rage which is already playing out in familiar Don’t Nod style but I’m interested to see where it’s going.”</p>

<p>And finally, not able to face the cold snap that we’re currently enduring <strong>Dom’s</strong> been playing Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road in the little bits of brain-soothing free time that he has away from the madness of working the festive season.</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What did you play over the holidays?</p>

		<p>Rust’s next major update is going to be released on February 5th, Facepunch Studios has announced as part of Rust’s 12th anniversary roundup. That update is the Naval update and it is going to be adding new content like player made boats that will allow players to sail across the deep seas to find new islands and monuments, along with new encounters. If you want to try the Naval update early, you can do so by joining the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/staging">Rust Staging Branch,</a> which is the game’s insider program.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rust - 12th Anniversary | 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-fvgsGB9QI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition, Facepunch Studios has confirmed it will continue to release updates on the first Thursday of every month, though some will be lighter than others. The development team has also confirmed what else Rust players can expect over the course of 2026 in terms of new content, including new animals like cows and sheep as well as a dedicated animal breeding program. There will also be new monuments, including an apartment complex, and improvements to player animations, looks and movements. The team will also be looking at previous content that has been released that has not been popular and will explore ways to rework them to fit into the current Rust experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to DLC, Facepunch will continue to release new items or skins almost every month, with a dedicated DLC team working on these. Additionally, the studio has announced it is looking into a battle pass system for Rust, but this is still in early planning and it may not materialise if it does not prove to be valuable or rewarding to players. When it comes cheating in Rust, Facepunch Studios is looking to hire more support staff and developers focused solely on supporting anti-cheat methods, along with a new anti-cheat layer that should be coming in 2026. Performance is another area that the team continues to look at as it tries to balance new content with already existing game structures. One of the key improvements in 2025 saw load and server connection times reduced by around 65%. Finally, Rust Mobile is also due to be released this year though a release date has not yet been confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-50-to-46/</link>
            <guid>1395769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>That’s that then. 2025 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2026, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of puzzling, and goblins.</p>
<h2>50 –&nbsp;Titan Quest II</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>


<p>Having leapt into Steam Early Access back in August, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest II</a> is aiming for a full release in 2026, this take on the top-down action RPG feeding off Greek mythology for its setting, world and enemies. It naturally shares a lot of common ground with Diablo, but those who’ve tired of the more MMO-like aspects of Blizzard’s latest could find a home here, with fewer enemies on screen and a more considered approach to combat which we enjoyed in our first looks at the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>49 –&nbsp;Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</h2>
<p><em>NSW2, NSW –&nbsp;2026</em></p>

<p>For how prolific Level 5 were with the Professor Layton series through the Nintendo DS and 3DS eras, it’s been a surprise to see the puzzle-solving sleuth almost entirely skip the original Nintendo Switch era, barring the port of Katrielle and the Millionaries’ Conspiracy. Nearly a decade later, not to mention three years on from its announcement, Professor Layton is finally making his return.</p>
<p><iframe title="【PV】『レイトン教授と蒸気の新世界』PV（TGS 2025 Ver.）" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGg-DYmG3fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Expect Professor Layton and the New World of Steam&nbsp; to be another feel good puzzler, as Professor Layton and Luke face new puzzles amidst the unfamiliar trappings of steam age industry. Just as unfamiliar is the much more lavish 3D animation and graphics, and then there’s the controls, with the Switch 2 version confirmed to have mouse mode support.</p>
<h2>48 –&nbsp;Styx: Blades of Greed</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The grubby, sneaky little goblin is back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> this year with a new obsession driving him forward. He seeks the power of the Quartz to give him a bunch of new abilities, and to strike back at the humans and elves that would oppress him and his kind. That makes him sound like an altruist, but he’s always just been out for himself, really.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>
<h2>47 –&nbsp;Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>
<p>Step into the flesh-ripping world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>, if you dare, with Clive Barker’s latest game adapting this sadistic universe into video game form. Doug Bradley will also be returning to reprise the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades!</p>
<p>The game will follow the story of Aidan, who is uding the Genesis Configuration (a mysterious puzzle box) to try and rescue his girlfriend Sunny from the Labyrinth. That will mean dealing with Pinhead and battling the cult devoted to the Cenobites in this survival horror action game. Will it be as dark and twisted as fans of the books and films would like?</p>
<h2>46 – Crimson Desert</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with a huge open world to explore and a plethora of bosses to battle against. You’ll step into the role of Kliff, a member of the Greymanes, who has been ambushed and fails to fight back against the Black Bears. Managing to survive, there’s a sweeping adventure ahead, spanning the continent of Pywel.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">I got to play the game last summer</a>, sampling a few of the boss battles, saying “We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.”</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today’s grab bag of games. Come back tomorrow for another batch of five!</em></p>
