		<p>Hello everyone. We have a different kind of post for you today from our usual coverage of the gaming industry. You may or may not know that TheSixthAxis has been around for 18 years now, with too many people to name who have contributed to our continued existence. Though we do have a special thanks and mention to TheSixthAxis’ co-founders Alex and Michael, and long-time editor Peter, who defined our site back in the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii era.</p>
<p>Throughout our 18 years, TheSixthAxis has maintained its independence, allowing us to cover the games and news we want, the way we want. We have full editorial control and our team of great writers, past and present, have always been allowed to write the articles they want to, with a little guidance here and there. TheSixthAxis has also been about community. While our forums no longer exist as more than a time capsule, they were a hub for people from all over the world to get to know each other and build friendships that grew. We continue to try and foster a community through our social media channels, and we are always interested in hearing from our readers.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, and with the current landscape of the games media, we are now exploring how to become a partly reader-funded outlet so we can continue to invest in the site, and support our writers, allowing them to continue to pen the news, features, and reviews that you visit us for. To that end, we have launched a new page on Ko-fi where you can tip us.</p>




<p>It is completely up to you how much you want to tip us, whether you want to tip on a monthly basis, or if you want to tip us at all. There is no obligation or requirement. As much as we would love to be fully reader funded, we expect advertising to remain a necessary source of income, though we will always try to remain respectful with their implementation.</p>

<p>Traditional gaming websites like ours are fewer in number which means fewer opportunities for new writers to break into the industry, less coverage of smaller games as sites fight for views, and less content for you to enjoy overall. Your support will mean we can invest in our current writers, and new writers who want to get into games journalism. As much as we’d love to, none of us will be around to write for TheSixthAxis forever, so we want to be able to hand over the site to the next generation of writers when that time comes far in the future. We can invest in improving our website so your experience is smoother. It also means we can allocate resources to cover more games, from AAA to solo developers who right now may be making the next big thing, but too few of us know about it. There is a lot we want to do as a team, and we want to remain independent and to keep the lights on while pursuing balanced and thoughtful coverage of the games industry.</p>
