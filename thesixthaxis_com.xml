		<p>The latest addition to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> library of retro games has arrived, with 2005/6 GameCube game Chibi-Robo! available to subscribers from 21st August, but playable exclusively on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chibi-Robo! - GameCube – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjP6uQflzMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Chibi-Robo’s just this little metal chap who wants to make people happy. At just 10cm tall, Chibi-Robo arrives at the Sanderson house and looks to help them find happiness, helping out however he can. That could be clearning up or finding lost items. You’ll run around completing tasks, but Chibi-Robo has a power cord for a tail, which is thankfully compatible with the local electrical sockets and power grid to charge up!</p>
<p>The Switch Online GameCube library now includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</li>
<li>SoulCalibur 2</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo! (from 21st August)</li>
</ul>
<p>With previously teased titles including for future updates including</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Fire Emblem Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Luigi’s Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>Following Chibi-Robo’s GameCube debut, the little robot that could had a handful of sequels and spin-offs on handheld, culminating in the 3DS game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/12/chibi-robo-zip-lash-review/">Chibi-Robo Zip Lash</a> in 2015, developed with Skip in collaboration with Vanpool. Sadly, Skip went defunct in 2020, so while we might see Chibi-Robo return in another adventure in future, it won’t be with the original studio. That said, a number of former devs started Tiny Wonder Studio in 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFlQ2QdZxA">announcing their first project, koROBO</a> in July of last year, which certainly looks like a spiritual successor to this GameCube original.</p>
