		<p>Artefacts Studio and New Tale have announced the first videogame adaptation of Fantasy Flight Games’ Descent board game, with this first game being Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent. The story of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent will be a new one, and not based on the board game so it will be something new for fans of Descent, as well as an entry point for those who have not played Descent before.</p>

<p>Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent takes place one year before the events of Descent: Legends of the Dark, adding to the lore of the world while introducing new events. The gameplay will be a turn based RPG along with exploring different dungeons with a group of heroes. Additionally, players can choose to play through the entire campaign or play through self contained questlines outside of the main story that can be completed in a few hours. Both the story campaign and standalone quests can be played solo or in co-op.</p>
<p><em>“As fans of Descent, stepping into Terrinoth has been both a huge responsibility and an incredible joy,”&nbsp;</em>said Bruno Chabanel, CEO of Artefacts Studio.&nbsp;<em>“With Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent we wanted to capture the feeling of a tense tabletop dungeon crawl and translate it into a tactical RPG that flows naturally on PC and consoles with a multiplayer cooperative mode to accurately convey the atmosphere of the board game. It’s easy to pick up, but there is always another strategy, another synergy or another build to discover.”</em></p>

<p>There is a demo available on Steam to try out what Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent has to offer ahead of its planned release this Spring for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
