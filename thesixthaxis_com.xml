		<p>Paradox ARC, the indie publishing arm of Paradox Interactive, has announced alongside developer CoolAndGood Games that it will no longer be publishing the space sim Starminer. CoolAndGood Games will continue developing the game independently, but a reason for the split has not been given. Back in October, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/starminer-will-require-more-development-time-before-early-access-release/">Starminer would require more development time before early access release.</a></p>

<p>In a statement, Paradox ARC said,<em> “After several years working together on Starminer, Paradox ARC and CoolAndGood Games have mutually agreed to part ways. CoolAndGood Games will continue development independently and will continue independently as they move towards the release of Starminer. We want to extend our sincere thanks to the CoolAndGood Games team. Building a game is always a journey, and we’re grateful for the vision and dedication they’ve brought to Starminer and our collaboration. To everyone who has followed Starminer’s development so far: thank you for being part of this journey with us. Your enthusiasm and support have meant a great deal. On our end, we’ll be cheering them on from the sidelines as they continue developing Starminer.”</em></p>
<p>CoolAndGames Games also released a statement saying, <em>“After several years of developing Starminer together with our publishing partner, we at CoolAndGood Games will be continuing forward on our own as we prepare for the game’s upcoming release in February. <wbr>We want to thank our friends at Paradox ARC for their support, collaboration, and belief in the project. Starminer has grown a great deal since it was announced, and we’re grateful for the foundation we built together. <wbr>For our community; your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable. Starminer has always been a project driven by passion, and your participation has helped shape the development of the game. As we move into the project’s next phase, we’re committed to delivering the best version of Starminer we can, and we can’t wait to show you what’s coming next!”</em></p>

<p>A release date for Starminer is yet to be confirmed.</p>
