		<p>Creative Assembly has announced that it is delaying the release of the Total War: Warhammer III Tides of Torment DLC from this summer to later in the year, though no new date has yet been finalised. The reason being is that during playtesting the studio came to the conclusion that Tides of Torment was not meeting the standards expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Tides of Torment - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQNKhxbQKuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, Creative Assembly said, <em>“<span><span>In recent playtesting, we asked ourselves if this next DLC met the standards that we’ve set in recent releases, and the short answer was no. However, we know it can and so we want to spend more time working on it, reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring. </span></span><span><span>These changes will likely mean the content we shared in our What’s Next videos for Slaanesh and Norsca is no longer accurate. As soon as we know the final shape of those changes, we’ll share them to you directly as part of the final What’s Next video to give you the complete picture on our third faction in this DLC and the changes to the other factions.</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span><span>We know this is disappointing news. 2025 has been a slower year for many of you in our Warhammer communities, and we’re not oblivious to that. We’re proud of the updates that we’ve released for the game this year, but we know that what you love most about this game is the option to experience more of it, especially through the new gameplay styles offered by new Legendary Lords, all of the unique new units , and the focus we give to reworks and core game improvements.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Whilst the game is in a better space than in previous years thanks to the efforts we made through 2024, we are currently not meeting our commitments to be more active on these fronts, and we apologise for not being more transparent.”</span></span></em></p>

<p>Creative Assembly has also detailed what to expect over the coming months for Total War: Warhammer 3. In July, Siege improvements will be released for public testing, with the studio using feedback to tinker with these changes before fully releasing it. In August, update 6.3 will add quality of life improvements for Tomb Kings and Lizardmen, as well as some skill refreshes for orcs and goblins. There are no major updates planned for September, with hotfixes for 6.3 being a priority along with development of Tides of Torment.</p>
