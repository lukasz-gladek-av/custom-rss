		<p>Sony’s plan to launch twelve ‘Games As Services’ titles has been a complete disaster by any standards, fuelled by mismanagement and poor business decisions to the point that almost all of the titles have been cancelled.&nbsp; Naughty Dog spent years making The Last of Us 2 multiplayer before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">someone pointed out that they’d needed a full time team</a> to work on ongoing content, staff that Naughty Dog simple did not have. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Concord’s demise has been widely covered</a>, the game was good but launching a colourful team shooter and not making it free-to-play meant it was dead on arrival.</p>
<p>Most recently, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">live service games at Bluepoint and Bend Studio</a> have been cancelled, both had been in development for at least four years. This leaves just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/haven-studios-fairgame-playstation-exlcusive/">Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s studio Haven</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Horizon MMORPG</a>, and an unknown live service game from Jason Blundell.</p>
<p>All of this has cost Sony hundreds of millions of dollars, and they’ve had very little success with this strategy.&nbsp;Some of this could have easily been predicted, as launching a game that is competing with the likes of Overwatch was always going to be a massive battle. To do that, you need to generate huge interest in your game and market the socks off it, something Sony failed to do with Concord. Spending millions on a game that looks and feels like ten other free-to-play titles is never going to work – players need a unique hook such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2’s</a> award-winning take on Starship Troopers, or the surefire success of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Those are Sony’s only live service successes so far.</p>


<p>If only Sony had something in its back catalogue, a well-known franchise that has sold millions of copies in the last couple of generations, already has a track record with multiplayer, and runs on an engine that means a PC version could be made. Oh wait, they do: it’s Killzone.</p>


<p>The Killzone franchise began back in the days of the PlayStation 2 with Sony looking for a shooter to rival Microsoft’s massive hit, Halo. It did not quite reach those heights but a sequel was soon green-lit and developer Guerrilla Games was purchased by Sony.&nbsp; Killzone 2 was released in 2009 and is widely agreed to be the best of the franchise with a Metacritic score of 91, with Killzone 3 following on in 2011. The next game, Killzone: Shadow Fall was a showcase launch title for Sony’s next-gen console, the PS4, while Killzone: Mercenary was a boundary-pushing title on the PS Vita.</p>
<p>The franchise has sold well over six million copies which these days doesn’t sound that good, Shadow Fall certainly fell short of sales expectations, but the fan base still exists and calls for a new game are heard regularly. Guerrilla Games has moved on to the Horizon franchise, which has now sold over 32 million copies and no one can blame them for wanting to do something different, but Killzone is still recent enough that it could be revived.</p>
<p>One of the best things about these games were their multiplayer modes, built around complimentary classes, large 32-player battles in Killzone 2, and shifting game objectives in the main Warzone mode. From Killzone 2 through to Shadow Fall, there’s more than enough maps, modes and ideas to draw upon that would stand out against the main multiplayer games of the last few years. Even just having a grounded, militaristic sci-fi style would contrast to the over-the-top cosmetics of Call of Duty.</p>

<p>Now, I am not a game developer and will make this sound much easier than it actually is, but ripping out the multiplayer from Killzone: Shadow Fall and using this as the foundation for a new game would be much more cost-effective than creating a brand new game from scratch. It’s still one of the best-looking games on PS4, and with eleven years of updates to the Decima engine, on which it runs, there should be some straightforward technical improvements to make beyond that.</p>
<p>Warming up the Shadow Fall servers probably wouldn’t be flashy or new enough, and it could be desirable to roll back to having more classes and roles, as in Killzone 2 and 3. Even starting from scratch, Killzone could easily provide the basis for a new game in the free-to-play market, and it’s far more obvious to greenlight a shooter than to keep trying to bring back Twisted Metal or God of War multiplayer, as Bend and Bluepoint were rumoured to be doing.</p>
<p>There’s even easy wins when looking for ongoing content. There are plenty of maps from older Killzone games that could be rebuilt, and a seasonal story could be wrapped around it, maybe retelling the franchise’s main narrative as maps are added. For cosmetics, Sony could raid their back catalogue with skins. There’s the recent Killzone cosmetics for Helldivers 2, so it’s only fair that they repay the favour, and stylised Resistance: Fall of Man cosmetics would go down a treat without breaking the sci-fi military tone too much. Halo Infinite has had some pretty out-there cosmetics, like the samurai armour and other alternate universe designs, but always manages to keep the sci-fi tone running throughout.</p>
<p>The main question would be who could take this project on? Guerrilla themselves have no real interest in returning to Killzone – they’re busy making a Horizon multiplayer game, anyway – but there’s obviously idle hands at Bend Studios and Bluepoint. Maybe they don’t have the specific expertise for a first person shooter, but Bluepoint has excelled in the past at remaking games, and with some guidance from Guerrilla to get the right feel, or Bungie who are pretty great at shooters themselves, this could be a good fit.</p>
<p>Sadly the obvious path is rarely the one Sony follows lately, but perhaps after being burned to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a cheaper, almost ready made F2P title could be just what they need.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> update has been previewed ahead of its February release, with Patch 6.0 set to introduce a new PvP map, Datavault, Tyranid Biovore and more.</p>
<p>There’s also the dangled thread that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. As we head into Season 3 of content for Winter 2025, there’s just Season 4 and Spring 2025 left to come, but the team writes, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>


<p>But back to the (almost) here and now, the 6.0 update has got a fresh batch of new content for players to take on:</p>
<ul>
<li>New PvP Map – Tomb</li>
<li>New PvE Enemy – Tyranid Biovore</li>
<li>New Battle Barge Feature – Datavault</li>
<li>Aboslute Difficulty</li>
<li>Perks Rework</li>
<li>FoV Slider for PC</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Salamander Champion</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Raven Guard Pack</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig in a little deeper.</p>


<p>The new PvP map, Tomb, takes place under the surface of Demerium, digging into the creepy environs of a Necron tomb. It’s a map that is closed off with narrow passages, so there’s plenty of blind spots to be aware of, though there is also a more open arena for a change of combat range.</p>
<p>In PvE, the Tyranid Biovore can now appear in all Operations featuring the Tyranids. This is an Extremis enemy that shoots out Spore Mines that you need to dodge and destroy before they impact, but it can also be deadly at close range.</p>

<p>The Datavault on the Battle Barge is a new area to give unlockable information on different parts of the game and cosmetic rewards. You’ll nead to earn special currency from completing the in-game Ordeals achievements across all modes. These could be thinks like making a Carnifex stun itself, knocking back Spore Mines to kill Tyranids, or completing missions in Operations at specific threat levels.</p>
<p>Through the rest of the update, there will be a perks rework, though Saber didn’t go into details here, an FOV slider on PC – useful for ultra-wide monitors – an Absolute difficulty level, and the following smaller improvements and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New finisher animations on Zoanthropes, Scarab Occult Terminators and Rubric Marines.</li>
<li>A new functionality will be added, allowing you to upgrade your Master-Crafted and Artificer Armoury Data to Relic by trading them. You can also sell your Armoury Data to get Requisition Points.</li>
<li>Absolute Difficulty (unlocked after completing 1 Operation in Lethal Difficulty) will unlock a bloodstained Knife Combat and a new pauldron.</li>
<li>Base Decals available for Right Pauldrons</li>
<li>A new option to share your skin between PvE and PvP modes will be added. This option also allows you to share your patterns between classes.</li>
<li>PvP Crossplay Toggle On/Off: allows console players to play with PC players. You now have the option to be matched with either PC players or Console players independently.</li>
<li>New Emotes – Strengthen the bond with your fellow Brothers with the new emotes! So go ahead and use them without moderation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding things out for Season Pass holders, the Salamanders Champion will be available for the Sniper class, and the Ravens Guard cosmetic pack will bring the classic MK VI ‘Corvus’ helmet design, a fan-favourite beaky look that dates back to the earliest versions of Warhammer 40,000.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/indiana-jones-hits-4-million-players-but-xbox-revenue-and-hardware-sales-fall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft’s Q2 earnings call has provided a number of highlights for the Xbox gaming division, including strong game and Xbox Game Pass performance, but the most important statistic is that the company saw a 7% revenue decline, year-on-year, in large part because of a huge 29% drop in Xbox hardware revenue through the final few months of 2024.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has brought in over 4 million players across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this is an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5 in the first half of this year.</p>


<p>Microsoft CEO <a title="People > Satya Nadella [120 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/satya-nadella/">Satya Nadella</a> also touted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> as having a record breaking launch quarter, as it topped sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation, showing the value in multi-platform releases for Microsoft going forward.</p>
<p>Both of these launches fuelled a 30% growth in Game Pass subscribers on PC, which also indicates the potential of this subscription service, after a few years of slower growth than Microsoft had wanted. This helped Game Pass set a new quarterly revenue record, with the overall Xbox content and services revenue growing 2%.</p>
<p>However, in the quarter ending on 31st December 2024, the gaming division made $6.6 billion in revenue, which was a drop of $530 million year-over-year. That’s quite significant and revealing, as 2023’s figures had the massive bump of acquiring <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard in October 2023</a>, flooding the financial report with all the sales of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Diablo revenue. That helped to mask whatever else was going on with Microsoft’s gaming business through 2024’s quarterly reports, but we’re now seeing a meaningful comparison once again.</p>

<p>It’s really looking like Xbox’s decline as a console manufacturer is now irreversible, and little in Microsoft’s new multiplatform release plan is going to arrest that slide. The company has a huge deficit to PlayStation this generation, without the impetus of exclusive games, there’s little reason for gamers to really consider jumping to Xbox in future. Things could slide even further as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 releases later this year</a>…</p>
