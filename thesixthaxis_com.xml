		<p>It’s been a while since we heard a peep out of Quantic Dream. While they’re now publishing titles, as well as developing their own, most people are waiting on tenterhooks for more news about Star Wars Eclipse, the game they’re working on for Lucasfilm/Disney. However, they’ve clearly got time to work on other things as well, with today’s announcement of Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play, 3v3 online multiplayer title.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmI8nzNHR8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the reveal trailer, Spellcasters Chronicles has plenty going for it. It looks like it merges MOBA-style gameplay with a more direct, third-person viewpoint, and it’s definitely looking the part, utilising an anime-inspired art style to bring its world to life. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, and the fact that it’s free-to-play will mean there’s very little reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>“We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios,” said David Cage, Founder and President of Quantic Dream. “Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players’ feedback and to perfecting this journey together.</p>
<p>This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative. It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars Eclipse.”</p>


<p>If this sounds like your sort of thing, there’s a closed beta coming up that you can sign up for now, with dates due to be announced soon. You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/beta">https://www.SpellcastersChronicles.com/beta</a>.</p>

		<p>If you’re into anime, chances are you’ve watched Solo Levelling. It’s been one of the best shows of recent years – albeit one that’s a massive power fantasy, but then, aren’t they all? One of the most anticipated RPGs of next year, Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive, looks to bring that power fantasy to life in stellar fashion, and publisher Netmarble will certainly be pinning a lot of their hopes on its success. Things are definitely looking good though, and in preparation for the game’s appearance at TwtichCon San Diego in the US, the developers have dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some of the game’s combat features.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. What’s great about the series is that he spends the first couple of series hiding these newfound abilities, but there’s definitely the sensation that things might take a turn for the worse in the near future, as he gets more and more powerful.</p>
<p>There’s lots of levelling up and fighting off fantastical creatures in Solo Levelling, so it’s little surprise to see Arise Overdrive focusing on that. As it’s a series based on the idea of a world that’s being experienced like a video game, it’s a perfect match, and one which I can see Netmarble doing a good job with. Combat looks swift and flashy, and there’s definitely some similarities to be found with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XVI, taking on huge creatures with melee weaponry and visually impressive special moves. </p>


<p>Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive is due to launch on November the 17th for PC via Steam and Xbox Series consoles. If you fancy checking the game out before that at Twitchcon San Diego, that’s going to run over this weekend, from the 17th to the 19th of October. </p>
