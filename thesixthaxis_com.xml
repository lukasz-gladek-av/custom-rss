		<p>Transformers: Reactivate has been in production since 2019, when Certain Affinity developed the game under a different name, Transformers: Rise. Splash Damage re-announced the game at The Game Awards in 2022 but since then, there has been radio silence, with just a leaked video of an old build showing us what the game was like.</p>
<p>Splash Damage have now announced they are cancelling the game and there will be redundancies as they “refocus on other projects”.&nbsp; Why the game has been cancelled is unclear, although it’s obviously had a rocky development path.&nbsp; Hasbro have said they really want to move in to video games themselves so maybe they pulled the plug and have another game with their own studio waiting in the wings.</p>


<p>Transformers: Reactivate was set in the future where Earth has already fallen and the Autobots are our last hope, fighting a new enemy called The Legion, “the greatest threat the Autobots have ever faced.” This explained the generic robots enemies in the trailer and not a hint of a Decepticon. Apart from that leaked information suggested the game was a free-to-play multiplayer PvE game, perhaps similar to Destiny.</p>
<p>Transformers games should not be that hard to get right, you already have the classes, you have the combat, and most of all you have over a thousand characters to choose.&nbsp; The Cybertron games got it right, as did Devestation, but since then attempts at Transformers games have been fair at best.&nbsp;The most recent Transformers game, Galactic Trials, is downright awful and should be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>Clearly I should never have championed the game on our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/30/our-most-wanted-games-of-2024-15-to-11/"> Most Wanted of 2025 list!</a></p>
