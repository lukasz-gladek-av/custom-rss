		<p>A new update for Battlefield 6 will go live today, it is a “smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6”. The patch changes melee attacks, ladders, and jet fighter combat amongst other things.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes:</p>


<h2 id="major-updates">Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li>
<li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li>
<li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changelog">CHANGELOG</h2>
<h3 id="vehicles">VEHICLES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</li>
<li>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weapons">WEAPONS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li>
<li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li>
<li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li>
<li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li>
<li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks. Sprint is now only interrupted until the attack reaches its target, rather than for the full duration of the animation.</li>
<li>In the Firing Range, target dummies can now take damage while in the process of getting back up.</li>
<li>Shooting with a suppressor now emits a small muzzle flash when viewed from close range only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gadgets">GADGETS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GDPIS was not destroyed when targeted by the XFGM-6D Recon Drone, Defibrillators, or the Repair Tool.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Sniper Decoy did not properly hide scope glints from nearby snipers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assault Ladder</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where ladders positioned above the player could not be entered.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where soldiers could be launched unexpectedly when attempting to enter a ladder.</li>
<li>Improved the soldier animations while climbing ladders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ui-hud">UI &amp; HUD:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new option allowing players to customize the reticle colour inside weapon and gadget scopes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where home screen focus navigation could become locked to the bulletin.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where weapon menus displayed incorrect Reload Time stats for LMGs.</li>
<li>Soldier lightning improvements to the front-end</li>
<li>Improved front-end lighting to enhance the visual quality of soldier characters.</li>
<li>The Reticle Colour option now correctly updates reticle colours for Thermal Scopes and other supported gadgets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfx-video">VFX &amp; Video:</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="redsec">REDSEC</h2>
<h3 id="weapons">WEAPONS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where jump landing movement speed reduction behaved inconsistently in REDSEC compared to other multiplayer experiences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="map-modes">MAP &amp; MODES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an edge case in Gauntlet mode “Data Extraction” where the drone could disappear permanently if drives were deposited at the exact moment it landed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ui-hud">UI &amp; HUD:</h3>
<p><em>Battle Royale</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the armor bar could disappear intermittently.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Airburst Incendiary Launcher icon appeared as a grenade in the loot feed.</li>

		<p>The Sims Mobile is no longer playable as EA has turned off the servers for the game, having removed it from the Google Play Store and App Store back in October, along with monetary purchases. It had been a pretty long running game, having launched in March 2018 receiving regular content updates right through to October 2025.</p>
<p>On January 6th 2026, EA had made build mode and create a sim items free, having told players to spend any in game currency before that date as there would be no monetary refunds for unspent currency. Unlocking everything meant those who still had the game installed could try out everything in the game without restriction.</p>


<p>As The Sims Mobile requires an internet connection there is no way to play the game going forward, unless EA decides to suddenly resurrect it. When the announcement was made in relation to The Sims Mobile’s shut down the development team said, <em>“Thank you for making&nbsp;The Sims Mobile such a creative, kind, and imaginative community over the past seven years. We’ve loved seeing everything the community has created, and we hope this final chapter helps complete everything you have planned and more before we say goodbye.”</em></p>
