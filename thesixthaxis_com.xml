		<p>Hello Games has announced and launched a new update for No Man’s Sky, calling it Breach. The Breach Expedition is a limited time event that will run for three weeks, taking players to an abandoned universe filled with corvette wrecks that can be salvaged for parts. The end goal of the expedition is to find the Fireship Arcadia, but to get there players will need to venture into hostile environments including the purple star systems.</p>

<p>The purple star solar systems were first teased in the Worlds Part II update, and players venturing to these areas will need to be fully prepared as these are pretty hostile areas environmentally. The prizes of stripping the Corvette wrecks may be worth it though. Equipped with your multi-tool laser you will able to take parts from the wrecks and use them to build ships at a Corvette Workshop. The items you can get as scrap include landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and wedge-shaped modules. The rewards going into the Breach include Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars posters, Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates, the Atlas-themed Wings of Aeron wing module, the Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade,&nbsp; the decorative Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid, the Aeron Starship exhaust trail and the Aeron Powershield which can boosts your ship’s defences.</p>
<p>Fixes have also been released since the launch of Voyagers, with Hello Games improving snapping, making collisions more robust, and adding the option to apply a colour palette to a Corvette at the workshop.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that there will be a free update for Pikmin 4, coming in November, and it has released a trailer to confirm what will be present. The main takeaways are a photo mode, Decor Pikmin, and new difficulty levels. In addition, the Pikmin 4 demo will be updated on the same day on the main game’s update release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pikmin 4 – Update Overview – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pikmin 4’s photo mode, you can take pictures anywhere using the Field Camera. This will let you capture moments from the game, and customise those photos with frames and stickers. The world of Pikmin 4 will also see the introduction of Decor Pikmin, which are Pikmin with unique features hiddent around the world. There will be clues present to find them, and when you do you can export them to Pikmin Bloom. Finally, the two new difficulty levels are Relaxed and Fierce. In Relaxed mode, creatures will not attack you unless you attack them first. They will also be easier to defeat compared to normal mode. Lethal mode is for players who want more of a challenge from Pikmin 4, with creatures being more aggressive and harder to take down.</p>

<p>In our Pikmin 4 review, Stefan wrote, <em>“There’s a pleasing mixture of the familiar and the new within Pikmin 4. The fresh camera view and tweaks to the gameplay make it feel more accessible, but for returning players, the focus on the Dandori ethos of planning, efficiency and adaptability provides new arenas to test your skills. Oh, and Oatchi’s a real cutie too.”</em></p>
