		<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay has received a brand new mode as part of update 1.09, challenging players to take on the Boss Rush Challenge. To access the Boss Rush Challenge players need to complete the main campaign. The Boss Rush Challenge will vary the number of bosses per stage with higher difficulty, and they will get progressively stronger. HP and army strength will carry over through a stage and when a Patapon falls they will do so without dropping a cap, but all health will be restored once fully completing a stage. Along with the new Boss Rush Challenge, there are some additional fixes too.</p>
