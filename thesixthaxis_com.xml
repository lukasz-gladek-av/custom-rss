		<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>


<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/ara-history-untold-update-and-dlc-roadmap-revealed-as-stardock-takes-production-management-role/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A fresh update roadmap for historical 4X game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been shared, alongside fresh information for the game’s first premium DLC, Untold Scenarios.</p>
<p>Oxide Games won’t be going it alone in supporting the game going forward, though, as Stardock Entertainment (best known for Galactic Civilizations and publishing Sins of the Solar Empire) is assuming production management. Oxide is still lead developer on the title, and the game is still being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this is a rejig of the game’s ongoing support, with Stardock having already collaborated with Oxide in the run up to release in September 2024 and through post-launch updates since then.</p>


<p>“With our decades of experience in delivering high-quality strategy games, Stardock is uniquely equipped to lead development on future content for Ara: History Untold,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games. “By listening closely to players, we’ll elevate the game’s history-defining potential for players everywhere.”</p>
<p>On the roadmap, May and June will build up to Version 1.4 (with a preview build), which will bring warfare updates, AI improvements in several areas, performance optimisation and more.</p>
<p>June will also see the paid Untold Stories DLC release with with new scenarios, maps, events, amenities, and technologies.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, this summer will bring Version 2.0 with more significant overhauls.</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>
