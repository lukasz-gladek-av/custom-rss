		<p>EA and Full Circle have confirmed that Skate will be entering early access on September 16th, with the game available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One. The game will be free to play and feature both cross platform progression and cross platform play.</p>

<p><em>“Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;skate.,”</em> said Jeff Seamster, Head of Creative on Skate<i>.</i><em> “From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community – listening, learning and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in,&nbsp;skate.&nbsp;is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers – just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</em></p>
<p>In Skate, players will be able to roll, grind, and ollie around the city of San Vansterdam which will be a large open world, with plenty of places to pull of tricks. San Vansterdam is split into four different neighbourhoods which are Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich. Each area has its own challenges and unique designs. To pull off various moves, the Flick-It system is going to be the key as it will be offering precision and control. New tricks are being added to Skate as well, and these are wallies, slappies and firecrackers. Additional features like Quick Drop will allow players to add ramps and rails to areas, allowing customisation that will allow refreshing of areas.</p>

		<p>Here is a blast from the past! Acclaim has announced that it will be revealing details about new games including exclusives on September 10th. It seems very much that Acclaim has some projects already signed up but has opened pitches for developers to reach out to the company with their games for the chance to get Acclaim as their publisher.</p>
<p><iframe title="#PlayAcclaim Transmission Received: A New Era is Coming" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>According to the official website, <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">PlayAcclaim</a>, this iteration of Acclaim, <em>“is founded by a passionate team of industry veterans with a focus on empowering developers and creators to bring their games to the widest possible audience. We provide funding and publishing services to video game developers, including production, PR/marketing support, distribution and more.”</em></p>
<p>Acclaim was a massive publisher from the late 80s through to the early 2000s, with games including The Punisher, The Simpsons: Bart vs the Space Mutants, WWF Royal Rumble, Mortal Kombat, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and South Park. We do not know what games this new Acclaim will be bringing, so we will find out on September 10th.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/lumines-arise-is-a-brand-new-entry-in-the-series-showcasing-everything-the-team-learned-on-tetris-effect/">Lumines Arise&nbsp;</a>was first announced back in June during Sony’s State of Play, marking a new entry into the Lumines series. Today, Enhance Games has released a new limited time demo for Lumines Arise on PS5 and PC via Steam, allowing players get a first taste of the game. The limited window to experience the Lumines Arise demo lasts from today until September 3rd. After that, players will have to wait for the now confirmed release date of November 11th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Demo Explainer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_s7uLivr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Lumines Arise demo will feature three stages, with those being Arise, Duo Soul, and Chameleon Grove, along with the multiplayer mode of Burst Battle. The Burst feature is indicated by a percentage score that increases as you play, and when it hits 50% or 100% you can activate it. Activating Burst means a shift in how Lumines plays. Instead of blocks clearing when the line passes through them, you will build up blocks to grow the Burst area. The aim is for you to clear as much of the area as possible when the timer expires. In the multiplayer Burst Battle, garbage builds up making the playing area smaller and smaller, but activating burst stops the garbage falling for a time. You want to be able to build up your score and use the Burst at the opportune moment to beat your opponents. To grab the Lumines Arise demo, head to the following links.</p>

<p>The last game Enhance released was Tetris Effect, and in our review we gave it a 10/10 saying, “<em>There’s a point when you’re playing Tetris and everything else seems to fade away. Tetris Effect takes that one step further by bringing the game to PSVR alongside its regular 4K HDR presentation, where the closed circuit of headset, player and controller is the only reality. In the main Journey mode – a collection of stages strung together in a series of EP-like sets – you’re still attempting to remove lines from the playing field by fitting shapes together, but when you combine the low latency response of the PSVR’s screens, the ever-changing visuals and wire yourself up to the music, Tetris Effect’s heady melody of the physical and the experiential offers one of the most compelling arguments for virtual reality yet.”</em></p>
