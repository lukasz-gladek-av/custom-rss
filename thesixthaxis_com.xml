		<p>Long-time readers will know I am a massive Bubble Bobble fan, and may also know that recent games based on the classic Taito arcade game<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/bubble-bobble-4-friends-the-baron-is-back-review/"> have been lacking</a>. That brings us to Bubble Bobble: Sugar Daddi.. er, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons!</p>
<p><iframe title="Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons | Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsuoLXelpv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the negatives, boo, this seems to be single player only. Apart from that it does seem to be very faithful to Bubble Bobble but with some new twists that make it appealing.</p>
<p>You can still run about as Bub, fire bubbles to trap enemies, and burst them to kill them off. You can still bounce on bubbles, launch fire and water bubbles, and the boss battles look like they are from Rainbow Islands, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Rather than one set of levels that must be passed sequentially, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is going a bit indie and will feature randomised levels so every play is different. You will not have to wipe out every enemy to progress either, just make it to the Donut Gate to exit. There’s also a new power up system in which you can use ingredients collected in your run to buy special powers to help you along.</p>

<p>That is pretty much it, and again that’s a good thing, Bubble Bobble was nigh on perfect so adding anything too different to the mix always spoiled the classic gameplay.</p>
<p>Arc System Works will be handling the publishing on PS5 and Switch (that’s Switch, and not Switch 2) in the West and most of Asia, and they will also be publishing worldwide on PC via Steam, and all of these will be out this Winter. Japanese players will have the game published by the OG creators, Taito, and that versions will be out in 2026.</p>
<p>I am cautiously optimistic, roll on Winter.</p>
