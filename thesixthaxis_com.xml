		<p>The morning after The Game Awards, and anyone over here in Europe is likely reaching for the caffeinated drinks right now. There were an amazing batch of announcements, including massive franchise entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, through to exciting indies like Coven of the Chicken Foot. My highlight might be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, but then, I’m weird. I’ve been playing some great games this week, and that includes Aaero2 which I’ll have a review of next week, and the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> was first up, and he’s been on an indie game tear, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/">Death Howl</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/unbeatable-review/">UNBEATABLE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/aethermancer-early-access-review-when-creature-collecting-goes-rogue/">Aethermancer</a> for review. He told us, “I didn’t really gel with Death Howl, unfortunately, despite it having some decent gameplay. UNBEATABLE is fun but the story mode is all over the place. The arcade mode is a much better experience. Aethermancer is shaping up to be a fun roguelike where you capture monsters to fight for you, but lose them at the end of a run. It makes you experiment with different party setups. I’ve also started Star Wars Outlaws, which I think I got as a present last Christmas. I’m still very early in the game but looking forward to exploring every inch of the map.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> stopped up late working on our TGA coverage with Tef, but that didn’t stop him from posting his stellar <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/terminator-2d-no-fate-review/">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a>, which he definitely enjoyed for its throwback 90s arcade charms. That was the pitch and it absolutely lived up to it.</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> was next up, and he’s been playing Wizard of Legend 2 in local coop with Laura. He explains, “Apparently, the game wasn’t too well received back when it was launched but it’s great fun now! Like a multiplayer Hades really.” He also spent time with one of December’s biggest releases, saying, “I’ve also just started Metroid Prime 4 and I can exclusively reveal that it’s good and that I’m not finding Myles MacKenzie nearly as irritating as the internet told me I would. Actually, I shockingly – whisper it – find him quite endearing.”</p>
<p>When <strong>Laura</strong> wasn’t playing Wizard of Legend, she got up to more family making in Jurassic World Evolution 3, saying, “This week a baby T-Rex was born and frankly that’s trumps anything else anyone will tell you today!”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> told us that, “Megabonk has claimed me” which feels like a cry for help. He continued, “I’ve nearly got every achievement and am trying to beat the high scores of my mates. I’ve also played a little of World of Final Fantasy, as I want to replay it, but not as much as I want to be a skeleton on a skateboard.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has had a fancy hat on and been playing Thief VR for review, while sneaking in a spot of Cyberpunk and Megabonk.</p>
<p>Sadly, <strong>Steve</strong> has only been playing ‘being off work with the flu’ so we all hope that he gets better soon!</p>
<p>Finally, a somewhat sleepy <strong>Tef</strong> has dipped back into Metroid Prime 4, finding all the collectibles but still contemplating a fresh run to do a 100%. Aside from that he dabbled with a bit of Nintendo World Championship NES Edition and Loop Hero.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Highguard is a new PvP raid shooter from the creators of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=apex+legends"> Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Titanfall">Titanfall</a> which mixes guns with magic, plus some light horseback riding.&nbsp; You play as a Warden who must fight for the Shieldbreaker, which in turn lets you smash into the enemy base.</p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh6Pi6h_css?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The rest of the game is being kept under wraps but we can see from the trailer it looks good, and while the hero character designs are impressive they do seem to fall in to the usual stereotypes. Maybe one day we will get a hulking, growly, muscle brute who’s actually a wizard with long-range attacks rather than a rage-filled, close combat animal.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows some of the abilities the heroes have and they are suitably splashy and spectacular and remind me of the Supers found in Destiny 2. In fact some of them seem very similar, the animations are very close, but I guess there’s only a finite number of ways you can wave your hands around to cast a spell.</p>
<p>There’s some horseback riding, but you can also ride a bear (don’t get any ideas), or a panther. Also in the mix is what appears to be medieval take on the Thundertank from Thundercats. The only thing that made me wince whilst watching the Highguard trailer was the blonde character shouting “Bring the heat”,&nbsp; that phrase has been used so many times in video games it is cheesy as hell.</p>

<p>The game is free-to-play which should give a decent start but the world of F2P shooters is already packed with the likes of RedSec, Fortnite, Overwatch 2, and COD Warzone and we have seen many games try and break in to that market and fail</p>
<p>Highguard will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on January 26th, 2026, will you be singing up to play?</p>

		<p>I know I really like Ace Combat, but in the world of gaming storylines, I couldn’t tell you one little detail about the somewhat crazy geo-political shenanigans that the series is known for. Still, we can all hope that the story becomes a touch more affecting with the announcement of the latest entry, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve, with its Top Gun-inspired aerial combat due for release at some point in 2026 and coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Project Aces and Bandai Namco, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is a direct sequel to Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown which released all the way back in 2019. This time out, you’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. The ageing vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines.</p>
<p>On this ship, you’re given a new name: “Wings of Theve”. A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But, as it turns out, that legend was a lie; it was just a story made to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies with three new comrades at your side, fighting to reclaim your lost homeland.</p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 earned a hefty <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">9/10</a> when it launched, where I said, “In Ace Combat 7, dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>

<p>I definitely can’t wait to check out some more aerial combat, and I’ll certainly try to remember more of the story this time out, with the new first-person cutscenes looking like they’ll put you right at the centre of the action.</p>
<p><em>You can already wishlist Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288340/ACE_COMBAT_8_WINGS_OF_THEVE/">Steam</a>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’ve had a lot of Star Wars games over the years, across a heap of different genres, but racing games have been few and far between. Star Wars Episode I: Racer – which appeared on a bunch of great consoles like the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 – was centred on the hyper-fast pod racing scene that George Lucas made a highlight of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, and, somewhat unbelievably, remains the highest-selling sci-fi racing game of all time. Ahead of Wipeout and F-Zero! It makes sense then that we would eventually see a new game set in a galaxy far, far away, and it’s called Star Wars: Galactic Racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Galactic Racer™ - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiavNl4qxWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set after the fall of the Empire, the trailer shows a variety of different Star Wars vehicles racing across places like Rey’s home of Jakku and what looks like the ice planet Hoth, with vehicles including speeders and speeder bikes. There are things that look like Luke’s X34 Landspeeder and the iconic Endor Speeder Bike, but I’m sure the red-and-black vehicle is a Sparrow from Destiny. That would make sense after the recent Renegades expansion took Star Wars into the Destiny universe, and Sparrows were ultimately based on Star Wars’ own vehicles in the first place. </p>
<p>At the end of the trailer there’s a reveal for anyone who knows Star Wars, with the Dug, Sebulba, appearing while stroking his beard fronds, and the iconic sound of a pod racer engine rumbling in the background, so you have to assume that pod racing is included, or at least some of the vehicles. Sebulba was famously Anakin’s key rival in The Phantom Menace’s race scenes, where the arrogant alien sabotaged Anakin’s pod racer, before proceeding to ram all the other racers off the track. Here’s hoping you’ll be able to return the favour in Star Wars: Galactic Racer!</p>
<p>Star Wars: Galactic Racer is due for release in 2026. </p>

			<p>“The guiding principle of Terminator 2D: No Fate’s development was always to make it feel like the kind of arcade game that could’ve come out in the 90’s alongside the release of Terminator 2: Judgement Day,” say the developers, Bitmap Bureau, and it’s fair to say that is exactly what they have made. I am old enough to have been gaming in the 90s and Terminator 2D: No Fate reminds me of the excellent RoboCop 2 game that was released on the Commodore Amiga.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE – Official Launch Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPzOPAJpYDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story follows the plot of Terminator 2 fairly closely, with a few extra missions set in the future. All the key scenes from the film are brought to life in chunky pixel graphics with even chunkier pixel text explaining the plot before you set off on your rampage of violence.</p>


<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is a side scrolling shoot ’em up in which you play one of the famous characters from the game and run around shooting bad guys until you reach the boss and finish the level. You can only fire in eight directions, starting with your basic pistol or automatic rifle, with bonus weapons such as spread fire lasers hidden throughout the levels. These pick-up weapons only last for a limited amount of time rather than a number of bullets – in true action movie style, those are infinite. Shotgun, pistol, or laser cannon; it doesn’t matter what you use, the weapon never needs reloading.</p>


<p>To mix things up a little, there are two driving sections, both based on the chase sequence from the film where the T-1000 has a truck, and Arnie is on his bike. You also get to play as a completely naked Arnold – his nether regions naturally being pixellated to hide anything saucy – in a beat ’em up sequence set in the Biker bar.</p>
<p>There are four difficulty levels and the harder you make the game the more enemies you get, the less health you have, and other additional factors are added such as time limits and limited continues. The developers suggest playing the game on Hard and that does give you a true arcade experience. By that, I mean you will be cursing a lot, and gradually working your way through each level over many, many attempts, as you learn the positioning and patterns of the enemies and commit them to muscle memory; 90s games were as much a test of your memory as of your joystick skills.</p>

<p>While the game does use the 90s aesthetic there are a few modern improvements. Most notable is just how slick the animation is, which has many more frames than you would have got back in the day when one megabyte was considered a lot of memory. The music is also rather epic with a couple of licensed songs that play out under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The big question is, does this retro gameplay work in the modern day? For me it absolutely did, I found myself playing just like I did in 90s, learning the enemy patterns and firing in their direction before they even appear. Terminator 2D: No Fate is a challenge on the harder levels, but deaths rarely feel cheap and it does have that much needed “one more go factor” that will have you playing in to the small hours. That said there is one level where you are chased through entire level by the T-1000 and if you miss-time opening a door or take a misstep then you will get speared through the eye with a metal spike. It verges on being frustrating but does feel like an achievement when you finally make it through.</p>

		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000, leaping from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/total-war-warhammer-3-review/">Warhammer Fantasy</a> setting to the grimdark future and galactic warfare.</p>
<p>A release date has not been given, but the game is in development for PC as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/total-war-medieval-iii-announced-at-series-25th-anniversary-total-war-engine-gets-ready-for-console-gaming/">as was teased at the 25th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER 40,000 - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVgCDqLTaJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the brief snippets of gameplay hint at, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will actually look to adapt the war for the galaxy and planets as opposed to settlements and cities – a more thematic, but no less significant change for the feel of the game.</p>
<p>You’ll still have the same empire expansion gameplay here, capturing planets, upgrading your fleet and having a war economy to feed further growth. Sieges become orbital bombardments, assaulting the walls of the castle becomes sending in the drop pods and landing and army. And if you need to, there’s always planet-killing weapons.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Four factions will be playable to start with – Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and the Astra Militarum (AKA the Imperial Guard) – and you’ll have the ability to customise your troops, choosing colours, emblazening uniforms and armour with particular iconography and also affecting their gameplay style. Change a combat philogophy, arm them with tactical abilities, signature traits and arcane wargear.</span></p>
<p>Game director Attila Mohacsi said</p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">“Hi everyone!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to finally share this with you: Total War is heading into the Warhammer 40,000 universe! For so many of us on the team, this isn’t just another project. It’s a dream come true. We spent years imagining what Total War could look like in the grim darkness of the far future, and now we’re in the process of making it a reality.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">A lot of us are lifelong Warhammer 40,000 fans, so this is personal. We want to do justice to the scale, the drama and the sheer intensity of this universe while staying true to what makes Total War special. It’s the start of a brand-new chapter for the franchise, and we couldn’t be more excited to go on this galactic journey with you.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">We’ll have more to share, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.”</span></em></p>
<p>So… whaddya think? For more details, the studio will be hosting a round table discussion for broad strokes about this game’s development and direction.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly are going to be busy with developing Total War 40K as well as Total War: Medieval 3 (as was announced last week) and building their game engine to better handle consoles.</p>
