		<p>Jaw Drop Games has stated ahead of the early access release for its dinosaur horror game Deathground, that the operatives roster will be expanded by two more characters. These characters first appeared in the Kickstarter concept art and have proved popular enough that they have been deemed worthy to be hunted by dinosaurs. The two new operatives are The Observer Finn Voss and The Hunter Cooper Calloway.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is Deathground? | Dinosaur Survival Horror Game | Down-low with the devs!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs_z0zcy6Qg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Finn Voss is a former war correspondent and military photographer, and in Deathground she has a motion detector so danger can be detected before it finds you first. Cooper Calloway is an Australian hunter who specialises in hunting dangerous animals, so it is only right that he is armed with a rifle to take down the dinosaurs that are trying to make a meal out of the players. The dinosaurs will be a challenge to avoid as they will use all of their senses to stalk players, and they will not follow the same patterns across playthroughs.</p>
<p>Deathground will be entering Steam Early Access soon, with Jaw Drop Games saying it will be before the end of September.</p>

<p>Stefan was spending his summer playing Le Mans Ultimate, and said, <em>“All in all, first impressions of Le Mans Ultimate are a little mixed. It’s certainly disappointing that a 1.0 launch doesn’t come with any kind of championship or career, but the authentic recreation of WEC, the full field of cars (if you’ve got the DLC), and the solid VR support all make this enticing for motorsports fans – it feels destined to become a staple of the genre on PC. I’m certainly keen to strap in and race some more.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced a trio of new games in a digital showcase for Tokyo Game Show 2025, all three of which can be played by visitors to the Makahuri Messe this weekend. From the residential care of D-topia, to musical RPG action of People of Note and classic action-adventuring of Demi and the Fractured Dream, let’s dive in:</p>
<h3>D-topia</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="D-topia | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Marumittu Games, assume the role of a resident maintenance worker at the D-topia residential facility, addressing citizen’s concerns, solving puzzles and uncovering secrets. Is this AI managed utopia everything it seems? There’s puzzle-adventuring with exploration and narrative choices that aims to get back to the human heart as opposed to the AI management.</p>

<h3>People of Note</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="People of Note | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note is a musical narrative adventure wrapped around a turn-based role-playing game. It’s a full-on musical with heartfelt song and choreography through musical sequences, but that’s also fed into the battle system and game mechanics through musical expressions and abilities.</p>
<h3>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Demi and the Fractured Dream | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Demi and the Fractured Dream is a tribute to classic action-adventure games from developer Yarn Owl, focusing on nostalgic hack and slash combat and environmental puzzle and platforming. Demi is a voidsent person who’s been born into the world of Somnus and is now seeking away to escape his fate, following a mysterious voice and helped by an acolyte on his adventure across dangerous lands.</p>
