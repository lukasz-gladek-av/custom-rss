		<p>A trio of Resident Evil games are heading to Nintendo Switch with Resident Evil 7, aka Resident Evil Biohazard, and Resident Evil 8, aka Resident Evil Village, all launching on the same day as the new game, Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p>You can read our hands of preview of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/"> Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and there’s a handy video as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>

<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>

<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>
<p>All three Resident Evil games will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>

		<p>One of the early exclusive highlights of the Switch 2 era, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is getting just that little bit bigger with a new tandem DLC pack that adds DK Island and Emerald Rush to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, out now! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tkyp0u73cPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>DK Island adds… well, it adds Donkey Kong’s home island to the game, letting DK and Pauline explore the idyllic scene. That’s nice, but Emerald Rush adds a new challenge mode through the full game. Taking the chance to join the Void Crew (after the end of the game, of course) you’ll go on an emerald smashing romp through each world, having to clear as much of the green stuff as possible to unlock the mode in later stages.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re on the fence about DK Bananza, you’ll be able to download a free demo on Switch 2 and check out the deformative platforming action.</p>
<p>The game is a lot of fun. In my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, I said, “Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It’s a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world.”</p>

		<p>The Metroid Prime 4 release date has been confirmed, the game set to launch for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tSSTH0Z8_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Also revealed through this announcement was a big new gameplay feature. Samus is able to hop onto a rad looking stretchy motorbike and race across the alien landscape, not just exploring, but also battling enemies at high speed.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game back at the Switch 2 reveal event in April, saying “For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

		<p>Nintendo is out to kill off the PSVR 2, announcing the return of Virtual Boy games as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, debuting on 12th February 2026 for both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s the catch? Well, since these are all stereoscopic 3D games, you will need a dedicated Virtual Boy accessory in order to play, giving you split lenses for each eye. Thankfully, while there is a full-on plastic recreation of the Virtual Boy which you drop your Switch or Switch 2 console into, there is also a cardboard counterpart –&nbsp;likely similar to the VR Labo contraption from early in the last generation.</p>
<p>Mario’s Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer had their specific shout-outs, but 14 games will be dished out for the Switch Online library in due course.</p>


<p>The full line up will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D Tetris</li>
<li>Galactic Pinball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>Innsmouth no Yakata</li>
<li>Jack Bros.</li>
<li>Mario’s Tennis</li>
<li>Mario Clash</li>
<li>Red Alarm</li>
<li>Space Invaders</li>
<li>Teleroboxer</li>
<li>V-Tetris</li>
<li>Vertical Force</li>
<li>Virtual Bowling</li>
<li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves a few games out from the complete library of 22 games that were originally released, some exclusively in Japan or North America. These are Nesters’ Funky Bowling, Panic Bomber, SD Gundam Dimension War, Space Squash, Virtual Fishing, Virtual Lab, Virtual League Baseball and Waterworld.</p>
<p>The Virtual Boy was an ignominious flop in the mid 90s, selling only 770,000 united before being discontinued, though has later come to be appreciated for its bold step toward what has eventually become VR gaming. Part of its failure has to be put down to the technology of the time, so while it offered stereoscopic 3D, it exclusively used red LED lights to render the graphics and give a sense of depth. Additionally, instead of being strapped to your head like a modern VR headset, the Virtual Boy sat on a tabletop mount, providing a fixed view to players of its games and giving an awkwardness to how you engage with the system, no doubt contributing to the headaches, dizziness and eye strain that the system became known for inducing.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s desire to constantly experiment and innovate has seen them return to 3D on various occasions, though. The most famous, of course, was the Nintendo 3DS, which featured an autostereoscopic top screen that could create 3D without the need for glasses. While impressive, the impact of this diminished over time until Nintendo released 2D-only versions of the 3DS. A fun little aside for the Nintendo Labo project on original Switch had a cardboard VR adapter, similar in concept to early VR adapters for phones, where you slot the screened device into a box with lenses to get the same effect. It’s this notion that is being revived for emulating the Virtual Boy in 2026.</p>
