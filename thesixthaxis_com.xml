		<p>It’s been an exciting little day at TSA towers what with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2 announcement</a> and everything, but not everyone is into plumbers who drive around in go-karts, or consoles where you can take the sides off. If you’re more of a multiplayer extraction shooter type of gamer, then the news that Exoborne, the latest game from Sharkmob, the team behind Bloodhunt, is getting a playtest next month might raise your pulse a little more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GZwprbl0ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Exoborne certainly looks the part, with players wrapped up in mechanical Exo-Rigs. These versatile tools are designed for survival and combat and they can be customised depending on the mission at hand. We got to take a look at the game during last year’s Gamescom, and storms seem to play a massive part, providing both visual impact, and deadly gameplay scenarios.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of gunplay and action on show, with some nods to previous Exosuit-equipped games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and even a touch of Bioware’s Anthem. It looks hard-hitting, chaotic and all kinds of fun. Of course, they’re entering into a crowded genre, so the playtest is a perfect way to gain feedback from players and to garner interest ahead of its launch later in the year.</p>
<p>Brynley Gibson, Executive Producer says, “We’ve been conducting closed tests both online and in our studio for quite some time, but this marks our first large-scale test, and it’s an incredibly exciting milestone for us. By entering this stage of open collaboration with the community, we’re eager to gather invaluable insights and feedback that will drive us to elevate the game to new heights.”</p>


<p>The Exoborne playtest will run from Feburary 12th to February 17th, and while the game will launch on console alongside its desktop brethren, the playtest is limited to PC only. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">sign up for it right here</a>, and don’t forget to check out the new trailer as well.</p>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO, the latest entry in the popular sim-racing series, has debuted on Steam Early Access today, starting the long journey through to a full 1.0 launch, expected later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Early Access is priced at €39.99 | $39.99 | £32.99 with an additional launch discount of 20% off for a limited time.</p>
<p>This is a more direct sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-console-review/">Assetto Corsa</a>, as opposed to the motorsports focused <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/01/assetto-corsa-competizione-ps5-xbox-series-xs-review/">Assetto Corsa Competizione</a>. As such, there’s cars that include everything from modern road cars to classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>For the start of early access, Assetto Corsa EVO has 5 tracks and 20 cars, alongside free practice, quick race, driving academy and special event modes.&nbsp;This will grow to include 100 cars and 15 licensed circuits for the 1.0 launch in Fall 2025, with 5 more tracks to follow after launch as free updates.</p>

<p>For now, though, the tracks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands Hatch</li>
<li>Imola</li>
<li>Laguna Seca</li>
<li>Mount Panorama</li>
<li>Suzuka</li>
</ul>
<p>And cars include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abarth 695 Biposto</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce</li>
<li>Alpine A110 S</li>
<li>Alpine A290B Concept</li>
<li>Audi RS 3 Sportback</li>
<li>BMW M2 CS Racing</li>
<li>BMW M4 CSL</li>
<li>Chevrolet Camaro ZL1</li>
<li>Ferrari 296 GTB</li>
<li>Ferrari 488 Challenge EVO</li>
<li>Ford Escort RS Cosworth</li>
<li>Honda S2000</li>
<li>Hyundai i30 N Hatchback</li>
<li>Lotus Emira</li>
<li>Mazda MX5 ND Cup</li>
<li>Mercedes-Benz AMG GT2</li>
<li>Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup</li>
<li>Toyota GR86</li>
<li>Volkswagen Golf Mk 8 GTI Clubsport</li>
</ul>
<p>The first content update has already been laid out to add Circuit of Americas, five more cars, custom race weekends, and more. Five more updates are planned through the year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this is following the path laid out by Gran Turismo and other always-online racing games. There’s early reports that server issues are blocking players from accessing the in-game licensing events, and thus blocking them from unlocking more than an initial five cars. Great.</p>
<p>Hopefully they can address the server troubles, and I’m sure many will be hoping they reconsider this kind of digital locking system, because the rest of what AC EVO promises is incredibly promising. There’s a new proprietary race engine that is designed specifically for racing games. It features a full 24-hour race cycle, dynamic weather and track conditions, full support for VR and triple-screen set-ups and more.</p>
