		<p>The classic GameCube game Kirby Air Ride is getting a sequel with Kirby Air Riders coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1C4XSLAacNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are pretty thin on the ground outside of the reveal trailer, but we see Kirby riding on his jet-powered star and joined by three other Kirbys on a variety of different craft.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is in development with Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai at the helm. Sakurai is a truly beloved figure for the openness with which he led Smash Bros. development over the past decades, often in the foreground to demo new fighters that were coming to the smash hit series. Given the labour of love that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> was for him, it’s great to see that he’s taken a bit of a break from the series to lead a different classic series revival.</p>
