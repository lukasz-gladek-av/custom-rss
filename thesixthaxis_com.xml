		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has released a new<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid"> Metal Gear Solid</a> Fox Hunt update that includes various tweaks to the publisher’s new multiplayer game while adding a much requested feature.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Trailer | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c46xM5-wScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The most significant change here is how matchmaking works. Previously, players would need to manually select their region which could prolong waiting times depending on your chosen region and the time of day. Now the game will detect if matchmaking is taking too long, widening the search to all regions.</span></p>
<p><span>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Fox Hunt patch 1.2.3 is available to download across all platforms and will need to be installed in order to access the game. Here’s a rundown of what changes have been made.</span></p>
<h3>Metal Gear Solid Fox Hunt Update 1.2.3 Patch Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Added ability to place enemy detection pings while aiming with a knife or gun.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>XP can now be earned in custom matches.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Players will now be matched with others from different regions when matchmaking on their current server takes too long.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Extended the duration of invincibility after respawning.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixed an issue where invincibility after respawn was canceled by rolling or using Naked Sense.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Minor bug fixes and adjustments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fox Hunt launched on October 30th as part of the Snake Eater remake. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/18/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-review/">In our review</a> we scored the multiplayer mode a strong 8/10, saying:</span></p>

<p><span>“Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt multiplayer mode rounds off one of the best remakes of 2025. It offers a surprisingly robust spin on existing battle royale and extraction shooter concepts, with smaller maps and match times working in its favour, successfully incorporating those stealth and strategy elements fans have come to expect.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite our praise, we also noted the game’s lack of content at launch with two modes and a handful of maps. In some ways, this minimal offering works in Fox Hunt’s favour though the lack of a future roadmap is somewhat concerning. Hopefully we’ll hear more from Konami very soon.</span></p>
