		<p>While 2024 has not arguably been one of the biggest years for exclusives, Sony has still had some big hitters come in. Those include remakes and reimaginings of beloved favourites, the dawn of new IPs that could go on to establish themselves as part of the PlayStation Pantheon, and more memorable experiences that will live on in memory whether you’re new to gaming or have been part of the PlayStation journey since the beginning. With that in mind, there could only have been one clear winner for this award.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> is pure, unfiltered joy. What better game to win Best PlayStation than one that celebrates everything PlayStation from its 30 year history? Astro Bot is more than just a celebration though. It is the culmination of a character that found its beginning in the original PSVR era, and then introduced players to all the features of the PS5, and now being cemented as the current PlayStation mascot.</p>
<p>Astro Bot has so many elements to it that make it great. Levels are based on classic franchises, there are plenty of Bot characters to find hidden away, tons of secrets to uncover, and it is getting regular free updates with even more content to play through. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and the gameplay of Astro Bot is really smooth too. Astro Bot captures the very core of the message Play Has No Limits.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was one of those gaming phenomena where it feels like literally everyone is playing the exact same thing… or at least trying to, as servers inevitably crumbled during the early days and weeks. Taking Arrowhead’s familiar formula of friendly fire filled co-op action, but adapting it now to a third person shooter, just being able to blast bugs like its 1999’s Starship Troopers was enough to grab everyone’s attention, but that initial drop would lead to another, and then another, and then another.</p>

<p>The initial hook was the humour of the excessive military might you could call upon for backup, while being inherently very, very squishy and prone to being caught in the explosion that you or your friends just called in. Throw in a meta-game of planetary conquest/liberation played against a DM within Arrowhead, and a wild obsession with a planet that quickly became dubbed ‘Space Vietnam’, and Helldivers 2 was pretty much all that anyone was talking about for a month or two following its release. That’s the stuff that GOTY contenders are made of!</p>
<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>It’s a little wild to think that a remake of a game that’s more than two decades old could be hemmed in by technical limitations, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> leaving the PS4 behind and going all in on the current generation, that seems to have been the case. This middle chapter in the remake trilogy goes all in on having broad open areas that are stuffed with things to do, whether that’s fixing chocobo stops, settling in for a round of Fort Condor, or getting stuck in with some challenge battles to perfect your use of the subtle new tweaks in combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the real draw is still going to be the retelling of the JRPG classic’s story, which is handled masterfully well as it fleshes out the middle third of the tale, further exploring the cast of characters and additional backstory in ways that the original couldn’t. It’s a good thing there’s so much side content to help tide fans over until the series’ conclusion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/29/game-of-the-year-2024-best-xbox-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With Microsoft’s numerous acquisitions in the late 2010s, many expected a year like 2024 to come much sooner. As it is, the wash of good games and blend of first and second party exclusives has arrived seemingly just in time for the tech giant to completely upend its gaming strategy and pivot away from exclusives almost entirely.</p>
<p>It’s a shame in some ways, the old tribalism of console wars still having a certain appeal like sports fandom, but in the fullness of time, it’s probably better that you can play whatever you want, wherever you want.</p>

<p>From its first announcement through to release, there was no small amount of concern for what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> would be like. MachineGames are best known for the Wolfenstein series where you mow down hundreds of Nazi goons at once, and less for the Uncharted-y style third person romps that were inspired so heavily by those original Indy films. Of course, the end result is pretty much nothing like either of these games.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own path, the largely first person view shifting the pacing of the game’s exploration and puzzles, the relative lack of guns pushing you more towards stealth and quick whip-assisted fisticuffs. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable adventure, and it also feels like Indiana Jones throughout, thanks to a solid rendition of the character by Troy Baker, and some excellently directed cutscenes that capture the madcap nature of the films.</p>

<p>This is a must for Xbox gamers today… and PlayStation gamers won’t have to wait too long to see for themselves.</p>
<h2>STALKER 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2</a> on its own is a remarkable achievement in survival horror. The immersive worlds, tense inventory management, and realistically raw and brutal combat that made this series so iconic are back in full effect – the awkward glitches and bugs that accompanied those original entries in the franchise also see a return as well. There’s a charm in that blend of seriousness and clunkiness, though, and it’s endearing to be scared for your life wading through irradiated swamps only to see a pig ragdoll across the sky or an NPC to promise he’s got the best goods for sale only to offer you moldy bread and a rusted knife.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful and unforgettable gaming experience, but the unprecedented dedication and perseverance of the Ukranian team behind the game deserve’s just as much recognition and admiration as the game itself.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Asobo’s rebooted Microsoft Flight Simulator was an absolute marvel in 2020, and it only got better over time. Built around a computer-generated rendition of the whole world, smartly adapted from satellite and flyover imagery, it lacked some of that human touch to start with, which was gradually fed in over time with region-specific overhauls.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, then, seeks to build more of a game on top of that framework. There’s a whole career to work your way through, which will introduce you to specific mission types like air search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, mountain rescue, commercial aviation and much, much more. There’s also new aircraft types, with gliders, airships and hot air balloons, and if you want (as it required for a number of photography missions), you can land your plane and go walk around. And again, that’s with MSFS 2024 featuring the entire world…</p>
<p>There’s some bugbears, though, and launch was plagued by server issues, no doubt partly related to the new fully dynamic download process that keeps the initial install as small as possible – the kinds of issues that make you thankful the 2020 game still exists! The future is bright for this one, though, and we’re keen to see what’s next from the team at Asobo.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-pc-game.1070508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Time was that PC gaming was synonymous with mouse &amp; keyboard gaming, this being the best way to play twitchy first person shooters, clickathon real time strategies, and the like. But PC gaming has morphed to be so, so much more than that. In fact, PC has become something of the urplatform for those who can afford it, as it has gobbled up former console exclusives, opened the floodgates to indie devs and early access, and controller support has got better and better to the point that Steam Deck and other handheld gaming PCs are now totally viable.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to our Best PC Game award, drawing from across the breadth of what PC gaming can offer. And no, they won’t be pushing your 4090 or ray tracing to the max.</p>

<p>It might be a little unfair to be putting a single release that contains 50 separate games (51 if you count the secret hidden one) up against more traditional releases, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/ufo50-packs-50-retro-styled-games-into-one-amazing-package/">UFO 50</a> truly stands out as a modern day classic. Inspired by the infamous Action 52 cartridge from the NES days (but with no sign of the woeful CheetahMen, thank goodness), UFO 50 sets itself up as the complete catalogue for an unreleased console from the 80s. Contained within are a dizzying array of NES-like games from all kinds of styles and genres, many of which would be fantastic taken on their own.</p>
<p>Completing each title unlocks content for the framing narrative but there is also plenty of high score and speedrun potential for the more skilled gamers. That being said, you will need to make use of old-school techniques and learning level designs and enemy patterns to succeed. There is little of the modern handholding that AAA games rely on here.</p>

<p>I’ve put most of my time into UFO 50 on the Steam Deck so it has felt like a console experience and it really comes into its own here. Whether you remember the halcyon days of dodgy multi-game cartridges or not UFO 50 is so full of charm and originality that it fully deserves to be seen as the standout PC exclusive title of 2024.</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Hollowbody – Runner-up</h2>
<p>I’d been looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody’s</a> release for a long while after playing an early demo and enjoying its novel take on survival horror via a Blade Runner aesthetic. This excitement was proved entirely well placed when I got my hands on the full game. The fixed camera angles, traditional feeling combat and excellently designed environmental puzzles all combine to make a true modern day classic, all topped off by the futuristic dystopian UK setting.</p>
<p>Since release, Headware Games have added plenty of new features and fixed the few bugs that remained to make an even more complete package. Most recently an over-the-shoulder third person camera perspective has been patched in to appeal to gamers who don’t share my nostalgia for the old school tank controls and fixed views. So good is Hollowbody that I’m planning to go back and replay it to look for extra stuff I missed before I do the same with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. If you have access to a PC that can run it, then you owe it to yourself to check it out.</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Ara: History Untold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>The last few years have seen a rush of new historical 4X games launch, as all manner of developers seek to put their spin on this subgenre before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">the next big Civilization game hits</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">Ara: History Untold</a> brings with it a fresh perspective and emphasis on the empire building and cultural aspects of the genre, almost deemphasising warfare and combat as you manage supply chains, production lines and more to get ahead.</p>
<p>There’s and arresting visual style to how your cities will sprawl across the map, but the framing of the game through the passing of ages and distinct technological eras will have a much greater impact for those who love to sink turn after turn after turn into this genre.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-nintendo-switch-game.1070424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-nintendo-switch-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This time next year, we’ll hopefully be talking up a storm about the delights of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, how Nintendo has handled their own cross-gen transition and the games that have straddled the generations. With that in mind, 2024 has felt like Nintendo playing for time, leaning heavily on remakes and remasters once again – trawling the GameCube and 3DS libraries for inspiration – though with a clutch of new entries in beloved series that absolutely had the capacity to delight and surprise. Notably, the princesses got to step out of the shadow of Nintendo’s leading men and have adventures of their very own.</p>

<p>One of the longest-running jokes in video games came to a head this year as Zelda finally got to star in her own adventure, with Link having to play second fiddle for once. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> could so easily have been a character transplant with Zelda picking up sword, shield and boomerang just as Link would – and Zelda has been a badass warrior, pirate, ninja and more in the past – but as is often the case, Nintendo and developer Grezzo sought to do something a little bit different.</p>
<p>Leant the ability to summon objects and creatures, and attach to them in multiple ways, everything from simply navigating the world to fighting enemies becomes a magic-infused puzzle, lending this game its own distinctive tone and style. Sure, it does fall back on classic Link combat in short bursts, but for the most part you summoning blocks of water to swim through, attaching to a spider that will then clamber up a wall or over a tree for you, setting field alight with an arsonist Zol, or simply stacking beds in gravity-defying fashion to create a set of stairs.</p>
<p>It’s thoroughly enjoyable and a wonderful surprise that has us keen to see Zelda step into the limelight much more often in future.</p>

<h2>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island –&nbsp;Runner-up</h2>
<p>So many roguelikes and dungeon crawlers place an emphasis on build-crafting, and how the emergent gameplay experience can be dished out through satisfying skill combinations or optimized weapon upgrades. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-review/">Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</a> is a delight because your build, and your optimized run, and your upgraded gear are all affected by the environment you find yourself in and the way the elements of the game-world naturally bounce off of each other.</p>
<p>Like the chemical reactions in Breath of the Wild that cause burning grass to create flight-enhancing wind gusts, there are layered systems in this game that crash together in consistently unexpected and hilarious ways. It’s an excellent twist on the usual number-crunching ethos of the modern roguelike, and perfect for a quick commute play-session on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s approach to remasters and remakes has been fairly scattershot on Nintendo Switch (outside of quickly porting across all the major Wii U games in the first few years of its replacement’s arrival), but as part of that, they’ve also struck a rich vein of 20-year-old games from the GameCube era.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> transplants what is widely considered to be the very best Paper Mario game into a modern game engine, giving it a buff and polish to help it stand up alongside more modern titles on the system, and in doing so gives us a perfect reminder of why Mario RPGs are so beloved, with all the quirkiness and charm of the story and character alongside the original Paper Mario combat style.</p>
