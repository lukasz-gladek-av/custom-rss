<p>In Moon Mystery you play as Sam, an astrobiologist who is alone on the Moon aside from AI assistant TOBY. Sam becomes stranded on the Moon after all contact with Earth is lost, prompting him to find out the cause of the issue. It soon turns out that Sam is not alone on the lunar surface, so needs to run, gun, explore, and use his head to solve puzzles to get out of this predicament. The Moon is not the only location that Sam will end up exploring, as he travels to alien planets and an orbital city.</p>
<p>We did not review Moon Mystery, but the game is currently sitting on mixed reviews on Steam, though recent user reviews are a bit more positive.</p>
