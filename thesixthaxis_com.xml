		<p>Developer Red Thread Games has announced its next game which is titled Hello Sunshine, and it looks like one inspiration could be The Iron Giant. The teaser shows you character, who is the last employee of the Hello Sunshine corporation, who is looking for something to quench their thirst. Unfortunately, the bottle they find is empty so they chuck it and, inadvertently, wake up a hostile robot. Luckily, a friendly robot comes in to save the day. A release date is yet to be confirmed, and Hello Sunshine seems to be PC only at the moment.</p>

<p>Hello Sunshine is a survival RPG in which you and the robot are journeying along a road to reach the tower at the end of it. That tower holds the fate of the entire world. There is a day and night cycle in the game as well. In the day, the sun’s heat can be deadly so staying in the robots shadow gives some relief. During this time scavenging for supplies and looking for puzzle pieces is the key focus, while at night you will need to make camp while the robot recharges, crafting supplies and carrying out any repairs for the robot. You will be able to craft smaller robots to help with scavenging and other tasks. As an employee of Hello Sunshine you can complete tasks that improves your employee rank, which in turn unlocks bonuses such as vending machines and rest areas, which will be needed in this desert. Hello Sunshine will also feature co-op.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dustborn-review/">Dustborn Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Dustborn review, Gareth said, <em>“While some of its gameplay diversions miss the mark, Dustborn is an excellent example of how to craft engaging characters and wrap a story around them. The game is filled with surprisingly natural sounding conversations, whether they’re serious and detailed or funny and light. It’s very rare that I encounter characters that are so believable in a game. Quite the achievement considering one of those characters is a gruff, bearded New Yorker with dwarfism who heals people by reciting poetry, who I honestly wish I got to spend more time with.”</em></p>
