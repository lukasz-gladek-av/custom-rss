		<p>A new gameplay overview video has been released by Rebellion for its upcoming survival action game Atomfall. Set after the real Windscale nuclear accident in British history, Atomfall is an alternate take on what happened after the events, with much more having gone wrong. Players are held within a quarantine zone where soldiers, bandits, and other dangers lurk.</p>

<p>The Atomfall gameplay video gives us a look at the world, including the village where you will spend a lot of time, plus the wilds and bunkers nearby. The start of the game will be quite Fallout-esque, in the sense you wake up and are unfamiliar with the world outside. The player character is a complete amnesiac, which gives a large amount of freedom in how you survive in this world. You could try and help everyone or be a menace to different groups. One of the groups present is the British military, who were sent in to establish the quarantine zone. However, under the rule of the military things are very strict with even the slightest indiscretion being an excuse for them to punish you.</p>
<p>The military are not the only potential threat. Outside the borders of the village, things are more dangerous. Outlaws and bandits roam this area, posing a real danger to the player. They will attack on sight, without a care of whether you could be friendly. The old quarry, the surrounding hills, and other locations all have their own secrets to discover. They also have resources that you will need to survive the world of Atomfall, The bunkers are home to irradiated creatures and patrolling security robots, both of which will attack players on sight too. But, these bunkers are key to discovering what happened so they will need to be explored.</p>
<p>Combat will be a mix of close up melee combat, with cricket bats being a weapon of choice. There are guns like pistols, shotguns, and rifles too, but as this is England ammo will not be easy to find. Using items found in the environment, weapons can be upgraded so they are more effective against foes. Crafting will be crucial to survival too, allowing players to make things such as bombs and healing items. A metal detector will be part of player’s inventory too, letting player’s search the ground for buried supply caches. Manuals will be found in the world of Atomfall too, unlocking new skills for your character like weapon throwing. The skills are grouped within four categories; ranged combat, melee combat, survival, and conditioning.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4 from March 27th, 2025.</p>
