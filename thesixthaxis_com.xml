		<p>1047 Games has made some major announcements today regarding Splitgate 2, the original Splitgate, and changes at the studio. First, and most importantly, staff are being let go from 1047 games as the studio reassesses its resources to work on Splitgate 2. Splitgate 2 will be going back into beta though will remain available to play, and the original Splitgate servers will be going offline next month due to the costs associated with keeping it running.</p>

<p>In its statement, 1047 Games stated it was shutting the servers of the original game to minimise job losses at the studio. As the rebuild for Splitgate 2 gets underway, 1047 Games has said that it will be carrying out more playtests and player surveys, so feedback shapes the way the game evolves to meet player expectations. You can read the full statement from 1047 Games below.</p>
<p><em>“We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it’s been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we’re more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.&nbsp;<wbr></em><em>We’ve heard your feedback and we agree with you:&nbsp;we launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn’t give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>So we’re going back to beta.&nbsp;We’ll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special. That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you’ve been asking for, and more, which we’ll share soon.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>Now more than ever, we need your help.&nbsp;We’re returning not just to our roots in what we build, but in how we build it – with you. That means more playtests, more surveys, more listening, and truly being community first. Our goal is to combine the DNA of the first game with the best improvements from the second.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>Rebuilding the core experience isn’t a quick fix; it’s a long-term commitment. To give ourselves the time to build the Splitgate you deserve, we’ve made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles and shift our resources to focus on this rework. This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today. They’re receiving severance and job placement support, and we’re committed to doing everything we can to help them through this transition. We hope to bring them back when we can.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In an effort to retain as many team members as possible, we’re also going to be shutting down OG Splitgate servers in a month. While we’d love to keep servers online indefinitely, it’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team. Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches. And when we return, we plan to have a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In the meantime, Splitgate 2 will remain playable,</em> and we’ll still be shipping Chapter 3, as well as fixes and high-priority changes. We hope you will continue to play and support the game. As always, please keep the feedback coming. <wbr><em>We’ve faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we’ve learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. We’ve got work to do, but we aren’t giving up. <wbr>We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won’t.”</em></p>
