		<p>Sega has announced that a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds single player demo is coming on 17th September, letting you check out the arcade kart racer ahead of its full release on 25th September.</p>
<p>The demo will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Nintendo Switch, but while the game is coming to PS4 and Xbox One, those platforms are being left out of the fun for now. This&nbsp;single player demo is following on from the Open Network Test that took place at the end of August – which had similar platform restrictions.</p>


<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Sega’s latest crack at the kart racer, bringing an interdimensional twist to the familiar racing game formula. Each race will warp you to a zone known as a CrossWorld for the second of its three laps, while there’s an influx of non-Sega characters, including Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like A Dragon, Joker from Persona 5. and even Pac-Man.</p>
<p>Perhaps more impactful, though, is the depth of customisation available to players through the Gadget Plates system.These let you equip a whole bunch of car-modifying Gadgets with two rows of three slots to fill up how you see fit. Gadgets take up a number of slots and then modifying everything from the vehicle speed and acceleration, to letting you carry three items, doubling boost, increasing the chances of particular item types, and making certain items more powerful.</p>

<p>We’ve been hands on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds a couple times, most recently experiencing the Race Park modes at Gamescom. I said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/sonic-racing-crossworlds-preview-teaming-up-in-the-race-park/">our preview</a>, “Is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds going to be able to shine as brightly as a certain plumber’s karting escapades? You’d doubt it, but I certainly appreciate how different it looks and feels. This game is trying to put its own stamp on the genre, the visuals are right out of the classic blue sky Sega arcade game style, the racing is fast and snappy, and the customisation potential for the Gadget Plate is crazily broad. Adding various twists and spins on the core racing is just the icing on the Sonic-shaped cake.”</p>

		<p>Frontier has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> Sorcery Pack will launch for their theme park management sim next week on 16th September, bringing a bunch of magical rides and theming to play with in your creations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Sorcery Pack Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pYoeMLX-5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sorcery theme will let you create new regions that can range from Fantasia to Hogwarts, with castle spires, candlelit courtyards, gargoyles, bubbling cauldrons and more. It’s going to straddle that divide between magic and Halloween, it looks like. There’s also a new entertainer known as Vesper, while new VFX and SFX options will let you make it even more immersive.</p>
<p>Five new rides will be included with the expansion, which can all be customised to your heart’s content:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OUTMAX – LSM Raid Coaster, offers quick switch tracks and swing launches that blend sophisticated engineering and adrenaline-pumping excitement to any park.</li>
<li>The OUTAMAX – Bike and Sidecar, introduces a sleek steel coaster powered with explosive acceleration.</li>
<li>Something for all (m)ages arrives with the VECTOR – Child Coaster, a gentle yet exciting adventure.</li>
<li>An awe-inspiring immersive simulation experience awaits with FLYING THEATRE, where every twist, dive, and turn feels as if you’re truly soaring through the air.</li>
<li>Lastly, GALE FORCE brings guests a dizzying pendulum flat ride where guests will feel every twist and tilt.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also some free additions for all players included in Update 7. A new Challenge Mode will test your park management prowess, there’s new creative options like being able to rotate buildings on three axes, new path customisation options and more.</p>

<p>Planet Coaster 2 arrived at the tail end of 2024, a continuation and improvement on the 2017 theme park revival.&nbsp;In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/planet-coaster-2-review/">our Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Frontier’s park-building sequel is a vibe, it is a mood, and it is sunshine wrapped in a very bright bow. Minor control frustrations aside, it’s the best theme park builder out there, with impressively deep customisation, beautifully detailed visuals and the ability to make hours of your life melt away.”</p>
