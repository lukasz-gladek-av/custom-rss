			<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> set a new gold standard for the genre back in 2020, the mechanics and structure of the isometric action RPG roguelites have become somewhat staid. The maze of rooms, the choice of exits, the array of collectables, the slowly progressing unlockables, the narrative that teasingly develops after every run; let’s face it, most of us could play a new genre entry in our sleep. Sure, we’d die a lot, but it’d be doable. So, it’s refreshing that Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree attempts to do something new with the standard formula, even if it isn’t always successful in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it42ZeHoj2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In what can charitably be described as an unbelievably tedious opening cut-scene, we learn that Towa, a priestess of Shinju, has been tasked with defeating a vile demonic entity dubbed Magatsu. She’s not alone in this endeavour, and is joined by eight guardians on her journey, the Prayer Children, and it is the addition of these guys and gals that mark the game’s first deviation from standard genre form. See, rather than a player character fighting their ways through hordes of demons solo-style, they are joined by a tag-team partner to form a dynamic duo. The first character takes the lead on movement and combat, whilst their colleague, tethered to them by a magical leash, provides defensive and offensive spells.</p>


<p>It’s a neat dynamic, and one that offers a vast variety of tactical options. You are given complete freedom to ally each distinctive member of your team with another, and in whatever combination you prefer. Highlights amongst the wonderfully bonkers Prayer Children include Nishiki, a buff Koi fish, and Bampuku, an enormous fluffy warrior chef cat.</p>


<p>Due to the variety of characters, and the tremendous quantity of build customisations each possible team provides, the loadout options prior to a run can be overwhelming. On the plus side, there’s always a new approach to try when you run up against the inevitable brick wall of a particularly nasty boss. Get the combination of characters and abilities just right – perhaps more by luck and experimentation rather than skilful intention – and it’s undeniably satisfying to wipe the floor with a previously untouchable boss. However, this delight is tempered by the confusion of never quite getting to grips with the unending variables and the complexity of character builds. The poorly designed menu screens don’t help, making even basic skill upgrades a chore to decipher, let alone navigate through.</p>
<p>Indeed, for an action roguelite, there’s almost too much here, of everything. Fully voiced text conversations between characters go on for an absolute age, with everyone talking a lot but saying very little. A lot of waffle then, the video game equivalent of two lovers refusing to be the first to hang up the phone. Meanwhile, the capability to forge your own swords is comprehensive, offering a level of complexity that would make Kingdom Come: Deliverance II envious. However, some of the forging system also seems… oddly pointless. Why bother tinkering with the appearance of your sword, when it ends up in the hands of an isometric character so small that you can barely even see the thing once in combat? Thankfully, you can just get the local blacksmith to do all the forging for you, benefitting from the stat boosts, whilst also saving on a lot of button bashing QTE’s in the process.</p>

<p>If all the mission preparation is an exhausting drag, it’s in the combat itself that Towa truly shines. Fast and responsive, your fighters look gorgeous as they dash around the environment, unleashing some spectacular screen-covering special attacks. Enemies are fairly dumb, though have enough IQ to seek to overwhelm you with their numbers. As such, controlling the space is key, ensuring you can hit as many foes as possible with every attack, whilst leaving yourself room enough to dart away from any reprisal. In a neat addition, each of your lead character’s two weapons begin to dull as you hack away, requiring you to swap over to the alternative weapon on a regular basis to boost your damage, giving the combat a satisfying rhythmic pace.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, despite not being able to directly control your partner, they still have a health bar and take damage, which feels particularly tight when you can’t get them out of the way of an area attack and thus lose your support spells in the process. This tag-team approach also serves to undermine the local co-op, forcing your partner to take on the role of the support character and restricting their role to casting a couple of spells. As such, they can’t take part in combat directly. This is disappointing, as a more focused co-op mode, one that stands apart from the single player campaign’s tag-team mechanics, would definitely have been welcome.</p>
<p>Even for a roguelite, difficulty spikes can be brutal, certain bosses are sword and spell sponges, whilst annoyingly having the ability to near insta-kill your player character. It forces you to get back to base and tinker with your abilities, settings and unlockables to even stand a chance. Thankfully, if it’s all too much, an easy mode takes the edge off the pain of the difficulty somewhat.</p>

<p>Visually, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree is completely gorgeous. Charismatic character design, phenomenal use of colour, and sumptuous environments make this a real looker of a game. Whilst the dialogue remains over-written and dull throughout, the visual storytelling leads you to connect with each and every member of your team. Which makes the most memorable aspect of Towa also likely its most divisive. As you progress in each run, the characters you choose are gradually sacrificed for the greater good and removed from play. This is both emotionally gutting – Bampuku is too cute and cuddly to die – as well as adding an additional challenge to the game; forcing you to vary up your builds, even in the late game, and demanding you continue to experiment to complete future runs. This is a fascinating addition, one that elevates Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree above being merely ‘inspired-by-Hades’ fodder, into something far more demanding and – most thrillingly – unique.</p>

			<p>Sonic’s kart racing series should have usurped that red dungaree-wearing handyman years ago. This is a character whose very reason for existing is to go fast, while Nintendo’s portly plumber would only really be rushing to deal with a nasty water leak. However, that’s not the case. While Mario Kart is a literal system seller, the Sonic Racing series tends to drift into second place, a valiant effort, but one which can’t make its speedy hero quite fast enough. Can Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds be different?</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Come Race on Our Level Commercial" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYOfP1a7xjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds feels as though someone saw Ratchet &amp; Clank’s dimension-hopping mechanic and decided to borrow it for a racing game. After the first lap of each race the leader can choose the CrossWorlds track, shifting the action to a completely different zone and introducing a random element into the mix. You might be zipping along through one of Sonic’s casino tracks when suddenly you’re transported to a watery pirate world, or flying through the air above a glorious technicolour meadow.</p>


<p>In theory, it’s an interesting idea, but in practice, it doesn’t give you the same sense of wonder that you might expect, serving instead to take away from the sense of racing on a single track, perfecting the racing line or finding shortcuts, and besting your opponent. It’s just… a bit random, and this is a racing game that already has a lot going on. That’s compounded by many of the tracks just not being all that engaging, and for all that they’re drawing on Sonic’s back catalogue, they might just show that Sonic’s levels aren’t all that interesting…</p>


<p>There’s multiple mechanics at work in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and the Gadget Plate gives you a level of customisation to tailor your kart to your particular preferences. Each Gadget alters your kart’s performance in some way, giving you additional boosts or upgrading specific weaponry to give you an edge against the cavalcade of characters that fill out the game’s roster. They introduce an element of customisation that’s clearly a bit unbalanced, with Gadgets turned off for online modes just days before the game released, but they certainly add something interesting to your offline loadout.</p>
<p>That customisation extends to your vehicle as well. Having definitely looked over the fence into Mario’s garage, you can now select different front and rear parts and alternate tyres for your kart. These also alter your kart’s performance, as well as giving you a dose of visual flair to play around with, letting you customise the colour scheme and add decals too.</p>
<p>It’s an odd mix of decals, filled with gaming partners like ROG and MSI, but then with Air Asia and Beyblade ones too. It’s nice to have the option, but it feels a bit half-baked, with decals unable to be stacked or placed on the side of your car, and if you change any of the parts, it completely resets the decals for that section. The result? You’ll probably give up on decals.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the shift from Sonic and Sega All-Stars to Sonic Racing means that this is a character roster largely made up of the hedgehog’s pals, rather than from the wider Sega lineup, and it’s a real shame. Sure, we’ve got Hatsune Miku at launch, with Joker and Ichiban coming in a month or two, but the other external characters from Minecraft and SpongeBob – and their associated tracks – are only available as paid DLC, and it’s not out yet.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, beyond Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik this is a bunch of characters that will probably raise little more than a shrug, even for Sonic fans. OK, I’ll give you Big the Cat, but who wants to play as Charmy the Bee?</p>
<p>That contributes to an overall lack of charm. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is certainly bright and colourful, and there’s the odd cheesy Sonic song, backtalking between rivals, and the occasional track that really stands out, but it feels relatively lifeless next to Mario’s last two karting outings. Sonic Racing Transformed was a real celebration of Sonic and the Sega brand, but this just lacks the same soul.</p>

<p>It does at least provide a fairly decent dose of karting. Drifting for speed boosts, performing rapid tricks and flips in the air, and battling it out with rivals can easily have you on the edge of your seat, and as you’d hope, playing with others in multiplayer only makes that stronger. It is chaotic though, and there’s a sense of unfairness that lurks in each corner. The overall lack of identity extends to the weaponry too, and there’s nothing here that’s as iconic as you’ll find in Mario’s series, or even earlier Sonic racing games.</p>
<p>Besides the regular Grand Prix modes, and the selection of speed classes, there’s also the option of Time Trials and the Race Park, a collection of different racing challenges that’s ideally set up for multiplayer, but can be played solo with an AI team if you want. They mostly mess with the formula a bit, so you can race in a team where hitting your teammates gives you both a burst of speed, or a multiplayer battle race where your team have to get the most item hits in. They’re an OK diversion, but they only really serve to emphasise the chaos of the races. I soon headed back to the regular Grand Prix.</p>

<p>There’s elements here that do work really well, from the customisation of the Gadget Plate and your kart to the Jukebox that lets you mix and match your racing soundtrack. Fundamentally though, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds biggest problem is that it doesn’t feel like it rewards you for racing well. Rivals shoot off into the distance, never to be seen again, while rubber banding keeps everyone bunched up behind you. That’s not fun, it’s frustrating, and no amount of dimension hopping and DLC characters can cover that up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a number of grand mysteries laid out before you in the opening hours of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">which I previewed last month</a>. Who, exactly, are you? Why have you been trapped in torpor for the last century? Who is this voice that’s in your head? And is there any saving Seattle’s vampire community as the Prince is murdered and everyone suddenly struggles for power?</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of these mysteries are quickly unpeeled –&nbsp;Phyre, your player character, is a legendary Elder Vampire known to many as the Nomad, while Fabien, the voice in your head, was until very recently a PI, who’s been indelibly bonded into Phyre’s mind at the time of his death –&nbsp;while others are deepened as the politics, backstabbing and coterie of characters starts to come to the fore.</p>


<p>Our second hands on with Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 picks up right after where we left off with our first, but it’s still a sudden change of pace. You see, instead of playing as Phyre, I suddenly find myself as Fabian, who’s been called in by the club’s owner to meet with Pandora. Pandora, though, has been murdered in a particularly grizzly fashion in the club’s backroom, staked on lengths of rebar and with her head ripped off.</p>
<p>Exploring the scene highlights plenty that’s odd or wrong about this, but there’s something nagging at the back of Fabian’s mind. As he engages his Malkavian abilities to gain more insight, he’s bounced back even further to when he was a baby of a vampire in the 1920s, and an eerily similar murder of a cigarette girl, scouring this site now for clues to take back to his sire and the sheriff of the time.</p>


<p>I love this layered narrative approach, and while the opening hours of Bloodlines 2 are clearly rather guided to get you into the story, I’m really keen to see how the ties between different time periods and the mystery wrapped around Phyre and Fabian continues to unfold.</p>
<p>Brought back to the present as Phyre wakes up –&nbsp;this was just a dream of Fabian’s memories, it turns out –&nbsp;and there’s more pressing matters at hand. The new Prince has one especially troublesome thorn in their side that you might be able to help with, as Sheriff Benny has gone completely rogue and gone on a bloody rampage across Seattle to kill anyone he deems to be too inferior –&nbsp;Thinbloods and Ghouls, in other words. Would you mind helping out, and maybe the Prince will let you stick around in the city?</p>
<p>There’s a clear lead we can take here, trying to trace Benny to his usual hangout, a garage in a corner of town, which is being staked out by the Anarch Ghouls that he’s been waging his single vampire war against. It’s here that we find Benny’s own Sire, a surprisingly young-looking vampire who brought the tempestuous Benny into the fold, way back when. We’re able to use dialogue and persuasion to get him to open up, convince him that Benny needs to be caught and brought back to the Prince to face justice, while learning a bit about Benny’s personality along the way. Can we catch up to Benny and bring him in without a fight?</p>
<div id="attachment_462937"><p id="caption-attachment-462937">Not Anarchs, but these are enemies.</p></div>
<p>The trail takes us to a building site, once again surrounded by Anarchs, and with a clear bloody trail that Benny’s left behind him as he’s been both hunter and hunted, and plenty inconveniences in my way to catch up to him. On this occasion I specced up Phyre as a Tremere, able to use blood sorcery for long-range attacks, and rapid hit and run strikes and it was immediately a lot of fun trying to figure out and plan how I was using my abilities, saving up and spending blood charges earned from draining enemies while taking them out – easier when being sneaky, but vital when in the thick of combat to also restore health.</p>
<p>I leant on three key abilities during this, with Recall letting me place a warp point somewhere safe that I could teleport back to after striking at an enemy, perhaps gliding across or dropping from above before fading away. At the same time, I could cast a Blood Curse on an enemy so that they explode the next time that they take damage, which is hugely useful for taking out tougher enemies, but comes with a time cost to cast at longer distances and when they have higher health. Still, cursing someone from a distance and then hitting them with a brick was eminently satisfying. Finally, Cauldron of Blood could paralyse and fix an enemy in place, screaming from the torment, which is great for temporarily thinning out a group of enemies or letting you close a gap.</p>
<div id="attachment_462938"><p id="caption-attachment-462938">The Blood Curse ability in action.</p></div>
<p>Working through a string of combat encounters, I really enjoyed stringing these together, scrapping through moments that didn’t go quite to plan, and happening across some fun surprises. You know, things like being able to pick up guns – using telekinesis, of course, because who’d want to touch a gun? – and blast away at enemies. It makes a nice change from yeeting bricks.</p>
<p>It built up to a big battle with Benny, having failed to talk him down, and here using a mix of Cauldron of Blood to freeze him in place to I could Blood Curse him was massively effective. Alas, I never quite had the chance to grab guns of any Anarchs that dropped in to interfere with our fight.</p>

<p>With Benny brought low once more, the narrative side of the game could kick in once more. Katsumi, the leader of the Anarchs stepped out of the shadows demanding that Benny be left to face their own justice, and after wriggling my way through that, the Prince saw fit to offer me a job.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that the game will really open up and, while I could have explored Seattle before this point, the narrative will look to take advantage of the open world setting. While it might not play into the specific fantasies that the original Bloodlines did, of creating your own character and navigating this world as a Thinblood, I can’t deny that I’ve enjoyed exploring this character of Phyre, their inherent power and some contrasting abilities and combat styles, and the narrative possibilities that Fabian offers. There’s just around a month to go before the full game’s release on 21st October, but I’m looking forward to venturing into the snow-blanketed nights of Seattle.</p>
