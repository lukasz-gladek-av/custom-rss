		<p>I’m a big fan of both The Last of Us games. The first game is easily one of my favourite games ever, and the second game is up there somewhere too. Combat is a real highlight for me, specifically its scrappy, improvisational nature alongside all the attention to detail that Naughty Dog lavished these games with to make each situation incredibly intense, but if I’m honest a huge part of why I love these games is the story. My only real issue with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2</a> is that the narrative pacing constantly drags me out of all the artfully built up tension with flashbacks and diversions. With the recently released Chronological Mode, I was very interested to see if that could improve, to my mind, the flow of the storytelling.</p>
<p><em><strong>BEWARE:</strong> As we’re going to discuss the story of The Last of Us Part 2, there will be spoilers for both The Last of Us games… and the TV show. Shocking, we know.</em></p>



<p>So what is chronological mode? Well, it does exactly what it says on the tin: you play through the entire game but, instead of flashing forwards and back wildly, it’s all in strictly chronological order. That means that the experience of playing the game, particularly towards the beginning, is drastically different. You actually start here playing with Abby in a brief fifteen minute intro to the character where you’re also introduced to her zebra-saving father… only to see how he’s so cruelly wrenched away from her and Joel’s role in this – it cuts to Joel cleaning his guitar whilst telling Tommy about it. Before you get to shoot a gun, you’ll be seeing all the big revelations that were saved for later parts of the game, including that incredible dinosaur/space museum scene, Owen and Abby finding an aquarium, and more.</p>
<p>So much of The Last of Us Part 2’s early narrative was hung around this mystery about Abby and her motivations for killing Joel so close to the start of the game, those revelations being held back to be revealed in flashbacks later on. Seeing everything laid out in order bring so much more depth and understanding to Abby’s character that was, for many players, masked by the same kind of instant, uninformed hatred that Ellie felt. There is, of course, an artistic link to having players so aligned with their character, but the end result was arguably too visceral for many.</p>

<p>After the introductory scenes, as the game moves on to Seattle, the chronological reordering helps to eliminate the pacing issues that I felt with the original game. Instead of the long stretches where you see just one character’s story, where the story builds up to a huge climax, only to be sent back in time and have to wait for it to build up all over again, the two sides of the timeline are interwoven. The experience of playing two characters in opposition to each other like this is quite unique.</p>

<p>There are a few oddities that are a result of this, though I’m not sure they could have really been avoided. Specifically, because Abby and Ellie are both in the same storm at one point early in the game, you witness that storm starting up twice in quick succession, but from each perspective. It’s chronological, but there’s nothing being cut, so some of the bits overlap each other anyway, and that can be a little strange.</p>
<p>It’s also fair to say that this story and the game was not designed with a chronological telling in mind. I wasn’t exaggerating when I said you don’t fire a gun for a good two or three hours and there’s lots of stuff that was saved for the latter half of the game that take up the beginning. It’s all incredibly emotional, it looks gorgeous, and contains some of the best performances in any game ever, but it’s definitely a much slower start.</p>

<p>By contrast, recutting a film or a TV series to would be much easier, but for a more natural feeling video game, the ebb and flow of gameplay would also need to be considered and adjusted, which this mode doesn’t do. Had this game been designed with a chronological story in mind, it would have been stitched together very differently, and perhaps still have had space for some of the flashbacks, like the museum visit, to be kept in place. This is&nbsp;an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem, and it does mean that it is still better to play The Last of Us Part 2 as originally designed for the first time through, with a Chronological Mode playthrough being more rewarding as a second play.</p>
<p>I do still prefer Chronological Mode so far. I haven’t finished it – it’s a long game after all – but I’m planning to just to see how different its finale hits like this. The pacing issues were my only real issue with the standard campaign anyway, and this has improved the game for me once you get passed the slower start, seeing how both sides of this conflict react to each other’s movements in sequence. I do applaud the ambition of Naughty Dog to cast Abby as a villain for the original release and then unwrap her motivations and backstory to make her sympathetic, narratively speaking, but that’s a huge undertaking to redeem a character after seeing them only through their enemy’s eyes and one that didn’t land for a large part of the audience. I can’t help but feel that the game suffered because of that angle. Perhaps doing things in the “proper” order would’ve been better?</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has been released, exploring a bit more of the game’s story and world that you’ll get to explore when the game launches for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">16th October 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Make the Most of Your Adventure in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo7PmXkP0LA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer reveals more about the story of Pokémon Legends Z-A, as your character arrives in Lumiose City and is quickly invited to join Team MZ, an organisation that is intent on protecting the city of Lumiose. In the group is Urbain or Taunie – gendered characters that will be your main buddy in the game – then the fashion desinger Naveen and aspiring dancer Lida.&nbsp;They’ll be your allies when going up against the main threats to the city.</p>
<p>Lumiose, you see, is transforming into a city that’s friendlier to both Pokémon and humans, letting them cohabit in the space. What this really means is that Pokémon will wander around in Wild Zones during the day, just waiting for you to come along and chuck a Poké Ball at their heads. During the day you’ll also be able to go shopping, changing up your character’s hair style, looks, and picking from a wide range of outfits to look all stylish. If you’ve got a Furfrou, you’ll be able to give them fancy haircuts too, like a Pokémon poodle kind of thing, and then just hang around at various spots around the city with your Pokémon.</p>


<p>By night, you’ll enter into the Z-A Royale with the Pokémon you’ve caught, looking to climb the ranks… from Z… to A. As you do so, you’ll end up facing off against bosses, such as Corbeau, the leader of the very nefarious-looking Rust Syndicate.</p>
<p>They are up to no good, I have absolutely no doubt, but there’s two other characters that will help to unpick the game’s core mystery. Emma, the so-called best detective in the city, will ask for your help to investigate things, while Mable, the acting director of the Pokémon Research Lab, is probably using you to pad her portfolio and CV when applying for the main job, getting you to catch Pokémon to aid in her research and then using this to claim that she’s got great management skills and is able to motivate workers to get results, all while keeping the budget in check. Bet she calls you on the weekends for work updates too.</p>
<p>Anyway, the big new mystery is that wild creatures are suddenly able to go Mega all on their own, with Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon running rampant! You’ll have to Mega Evolution your own creatures to fight back, perhaps using the newly revealed Mega Dragonite, who now has wings sprouting out of its head and a big pearl on its tail.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and Switch 2, and fans will be keen to discover what this means for performance and graphics, after the frankly abysmal state of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on original Switch. That game was patched with Switch 2 support and now plays a whole lot better, but it’s still very rough on the original console. Z-A will bring improved resolution and performance to the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but how will it run on the base console?</p>

		<p>The Pokémon Company and Wallace &amp; Gromit creators Aardman Animations have announced the stop-motion animation Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om_7wKXw1XE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The animation is set to come out in 2027.</p>
<p>Little is known about The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu, though we can infer from the teaser trailer that Pichu and Sirfetch’d get up to mischief. Don’t believe me? Well, I don’t really know what to say.</p>
<p>The trailer blurb says:</p>

<p><em>Sirfetch’d and Pichu are front and centre as the heroes of the show, which is set in a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart. The series will offer a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the perspective of Pokémon, with the signature Aardman sense of character, comedy and craft.</em></p>
<p>Partnering with Aardman is sure to deliver some wonderful animation, with the studio having a litany of award-winning animated hits, starting with the original claymation Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts before getting much more ambitious with full cinematic productions like Chicken Run, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! Shaun the Sheep Movie and last year’s TV movie Wallace &amp; Gromit Vengeance Most Fowl.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Netflix show Pokémon Concierge is set to continue with new episodes arriving on 4th September. The first season of four episodes released in 2023, with&nbsp;Dwarf Studios adapting the world of Pokémon into animated figurines and felt creatures. It’s a lovely art style.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW Pokémon Concierge Episodes ????️ | Coming September 4 to Netflix | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzL8NUUgwdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The series follows Haru, a down on her luck workaholic who gets away from it all by visiting the Pokémon Resort and becoming a concierge, working to care for Pokémon visitors to the island. The second season looks like there’s a romantic storyline.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive/">Saber Interactive</a> and Boss Team Games are bringing an iconic horror franchise back to life&nbsp; with Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, a single-player survival horror action game set in the flesh-ripping world of Hellraiser.&nbsp; They’ve also managed to persuade actor Doug Bradley to return to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Hellraiser, or at least the books and the first movie, have always leaned heavily into sex and BDSM where pain also means pleasure, and judging by the trailer Boss Team Games have kept that element as it begins with a very intimate scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The fact that the game looks so authentic may have something to do with Clive Barker himself being onboard for Hellraiser: Revival.</p>
<p>“Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,” said Barker. “The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence—the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque—and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p>

<p>Hellraiser: Revival follows Aiden who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration puzzle box and save his girlfriend from the clutches of Pinhead himself. The puzzle box is not just the McGuffin for the game, you can use it to unleash hellish powers while you battle the Cenobites.</p>
<p>The game is coming to &nbsp;<a
