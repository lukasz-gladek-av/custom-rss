		<p>Marking the first birthday of Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, the game is out now for PlayStation 5, and a meaty anniversary update has been released for the game on PC and Xbox Series X|S. The game is also now available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> tier, having originally been tied to ‘Day One’ elligible tiers.*</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Anniversary Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NO_uAjEhEpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On a high level, the anniversary update has added three new races that you can create your character as – dwarves, orlan and aumaua – and there’s a new quarterstaff weapon that you can adopt.</p>
<p>While the game wasn’t designed with it in mind, New Game Plus has also been added for anyone that has a save that’s passed the point of no return and beaten the game. Starting over, the only real caveat is that weapon levelling will not persist, but that’s fine because you’ll be nice and mighty in other ways.</p>
<p>And you can show off how mighty you are with a photo mode to capture specific moments while you’re playing.</p>

<p>Avowed was one of the highlights for Xbox and PC gamers last year, though one a little overlooked for launching in February and perhaps not being as broad as some might have liked, following on from the PIllars of Eternity games. “Avowed is an incredible RPG,” we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">our review</a>. “Its vibrant world and stellar cast make every moment a joy to take part in, enhanced by a script that gives equal measure to drama, action and humour. Coming hot on the heels of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Microsoft’s software revival is well underway.”</p>



<p><wbr><br>
<b>New Game&nbsp;Plus</b>&nbsp;is now available after completing the main story. This mode is designed to reward mastery, experimentation,&nbsp;and making the all-powerful build.&nbsp;<wbr><br>
<b>When starting a New Game&nbsp;Plus&nbsp;save,&nbsp;players will bring along with them:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>All&nbsp;unlocked abilities (with the exception of&nbsp;godlike abilities which are gained through story progression/world exploration)&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All spent attribute points&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unique weapons and armors—but they are reset to level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unlocked enchantments&nbsp;remain&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All unique gloves and boots&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All necklaces, all rings, and all trinkets&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Any&nbsp;<i>equipped</i>&nbsp;Common Weapons or Armor items are kept, but they are reset to level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The following&nbsp;are&nbsp;removed from the player at the start of a New Game Plus:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>All common weapons and armor that&nbsp;<i>aren’t</i>&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Companions must be picked up via story progression&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Companions keep their talent points and start at level 1&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>All resources that had been collected</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Gold&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Upgrade materials&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enchanting materials&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Food ingredients&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>All consumables that had been collected</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>All potions&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>All food&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>All quest items&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>All god totems/trinkets&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>Fast travel points/fog of war&nbsp;</b><wbr></li>
<li><b>The&nbsp;aforementioned godlike&nbsp;abilities</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>To ensure challenge scales alongside player power:</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enemy stats are increased across the board&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Enemies now have a chance to have modifiers applied to them&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Elemental Modifiers&nbsp;</b><wbr></p>
<ul>

<li>Attribute&nbsp;stat cap&nbsp;rises&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>15 to&nbsp;30</b>&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>An important note for those who have already completed&nbsp;<i>Avowed</i></b>: Since New Game Plus is being added post release and the game was not initially designed with it in mind, a completion save will be necessary&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;take advantage of the mode. You will need to load a point of no return save or later and beat the game to make a proper New Game Plus save.&nbsp;<wbr></p>

<p>Included in the anniversary update is a major expansion to character creation:&nbsp;<b>three new playable species</b>&nbsp;join the existing Humans and Elves.&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dwarves</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;The most well-traveled species in Eora, the stout dwarves are known for their great strength and tenacity.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>Orlans</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Their two-toned skin, prominent ears,&nbsp;and&nbsp;hirsute bodies all in the smallest size of Kith&nbsp;make them stand&nbsp;outs&nbsp;in Eora.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><b>Aumaua</b>&nbsp;– Towering, powerfully built, and physically imposing.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do the&nbsp;different species&nbsp;change how you look,&nbsp;the team&nbsp;has also added in stat bonuses for all species adding another layer to character creation.&nbsp;<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Humans</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>+1 Might&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>+1 Resolve&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Elves</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>+1 Dexterity&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>+1 Perception&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Aumaua</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>+2 Might&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Dwarves</b>&nbsp;<wbr>

<li>+1 Might&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>+1 Constitution&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Orlans</b>&nbsp;<wbr>
<ul>
<li>+1 Perception&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>+1 Resolve&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, players will receive stat bonuses depending on their chosen background.<wbr></p>
<ul>

<p><b>Improved Character Creation</b><wbr><br>

<wbr></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda has released update 1.2 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skyrim</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, fully addressing the woeful performance that blighted the game’s latest port. It follows on from an update shortly after its December release that quickly removed the frame rate cap to improve latency, but now tackles this with a full 60fps performance mode, fixes to visual glitches, and more.</p>
<p>The game performance is the most significant improvement, a new toggle under the Display settings letting you prioritise visuals or performance. This tweaks visual settings and resolution targets in order to deliver 60fps, which from anecdotal online accounts seems to be pretty solid. Additionally, the 30fps visuals have been locked back to this frame rate and the graphics tweaked to give steadier performance.</p>


<p>It’s a huge shame that the game couldn’t have had this degree of performance and refinement at its original release, as it led to a lot of bad reviews – we ended up having to give it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-switch-2-review/">a 5/10 because of the issues</a>. However, it does give a glimmer of optimism for the Fallout 4 port to Switch 2 which is set to drop next week.</p>
<p>The Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 patch notes are as follows</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.</li>
<li>In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Performance Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.</li>
<li>Fixed an audio-related crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.</li>
<li>Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations:
<ul>
<li>during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove</li>
<li>during combat at Secunda’s Kiss</li>
<li>when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location</li>
<li>when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visuals Issues Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.</li>
<li>Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.</li>
<li>Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.</li>
<li>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.</li>
<li>The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.</li>
<li>The “Delete” prompt remained grayed-out within the Load menu when swapping between mouse and controller mode.</li>
<li>Deleting a save in the Save/Load menus reset the highlighted selection to the top of the menu list.</li>
<li>While in mouse mode, the cursor remained stuck within a smaller section of the screen when changing between docked/undocked modes or interfacing with GameChat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The “Eagle Eye” Archery perk remained active after switching between mouse and controller mode.</li>
<li>Holding down the Right Joystick while reassigning a button caused that button to disappear from the Controls list.</li>
<li>The Joy-Con 2 controllers provided haptic feedback while in mouse mode.</li>
<li>Buttons became unresponsive when controls were remapped while moving the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode.</li>
<li>Rotating the map in mouse mode was slower and less smooth than in controller mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio Issue Fix:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrolling SFX continued to play while holding up or down on the Left Joystick or buttons at the top or bottom of the Save/Load menus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localization Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Amiibo” appeared as plural in Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new translations for the features listed above and UI updates.</li>
<li>Updates were made to the game credits.</li>
</ul>

		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </a>advert that screened on YouTube and on streaming services for ITV and Channel 5 has been banned by the UK’s advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).</p>
<p>The ad shows a ‘replacement’ airport security guard frisking a man and asking him to remove “everything but the shoes”, before a female guard snaps on a rubber glove and gleefully adds, “Here comes the puppet show.”</p>


<p>The Advertising Standards Authority received nine complaints from people who believed the ad trivialised sexual violence.</p>
<p>The ASA acknowledged that there was no explicit imagery in the advert, but the humour was “generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man”.</p>

<p>They concluded the advert “trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - The Replacer &quot;Airport Security&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH1csdj8oMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Activision has clarified that the advert was not shown around children’s programming. Black Ops 7 has a PEGI 18 rating for “graphic violence, decapitations, dismemberment, strong language,” so it should not be sold to children.</p>
<p>We scored Call of Duty : Black Ops 7 a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">6/10 in our review.</a> “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>“It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>
