		<p>We’re still in the outer fringes of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, so you can still expect a little bit of everything to appear. We’ve got indie takes on classic genres, we’ve got a bit of musical hotel renovation, sci-fi horror, and ambitious multiplayer games within this crop of five…. so what are we waiting for?</p>
<h2>45 –&nbsp;Mars Tactics</h2>
<p><em>PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p>Who doesn’t love a bit of turn-based tactics? The XCOM-alike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mars-tactics">Mars Tactics</a> has a simple story, with Labor Revolutionaries looking to usurp the domineering Capital army, and there’s the traditional back and forth of this genre… except there’s also environmental destruction!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Trailer and Release Date Announcement: May 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPB_1Ngqs9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No good cover within walking distance? Just chuck a grenade to “dig” a whole. Enemies raining down first from a rooftop? How about you blow up half the building? And with a suppressing fire system as well, there’s plenty of new and fresh tactical options to take advantage of.</p>

<h2>44 –&nbsp;There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>While it might start off as a quirky hotel renovation game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</a> soon reveals its true colours, whipping up a story about strange supernatural terrors that haunt much more than just the hotel you’ve inherited.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a lovely musical lilt to this as well, so story beats and cutscenes don’t just play out in raw emotion, but instead see characters breaking out into song, often with a bit of reggae, and with the ability to shape the story through choosing a verse for your protagonist to reply with. I can’t wait!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">Catch our preview of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand here</a>.</p>
<h2>43 –&nbsp;Directive 8020</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>Where Supermassive spun out the first series of The Dark Pictures anthology games in rapid succession, the wait for the new generation of the studio’s horror games is extending into 2026. Yet we’re still very keen to see how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> comes together.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Directive 8020 | Gamescom 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmqh6m7vSBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in Supermassive’s series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship. The game is really pushing Supermassive’s breed of horror into action game territory, the sci-fi setting, the tight third person control and needing to stealthily sneak and evade the alien monster that’s hunting you.</p>
<h2>42 –&nbsp;Highguard</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 26th January 2026</em></p>
<p>There’s some mixed feelings out there about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, and I reckon that an awful lot of it is simply from the fact that a free-to-play mythic fantasy hero shooter was the game that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/">closed out The Game Awards</a> last month with its reveal. When you ideally want to save the best until last (especially for the time zone suffering incurred on anyone outside the Americas), this wasn’t it. But… when you mention that this is coming from some of the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall? Well, that should be pretty intriguing, so <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/13/why-are-gamers-hoping-highguard-will-be-dead-on-arrival/">why do people seem to want to see it fail</a>? Not us!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, what is Highguard? Well, they themselves describe it as “a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<h2>41 –&nbsp;Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, NSW, PC –&nbsp;5th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Square Enix know a thing or seventy-two about remastering their classics, and it feels like every remake and remaster takes a different approach to the visuals and gameplay changes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Adventure Log Part 1 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtcnET6lQwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too. Absolutely one to watch for classic JRPG fans.</p>

<p><em>Another five in the bag. We’re going to keep things rolling through the weekend, so expect five more of our Most Wanted games of 2026 to be discussed tomorrow!</em></p>

		<p>How have you been getting on in the new year? I’ve just about remembered that it’s ’26 and not ’25 anymore for this round up, so we’re off to a good start, I’d say.</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a chilly one with the thermostats dipping below 0ºC and some snow and ice on the ground. As if you needed one, it’s a good excuse to continue your holiday gaming, isn’t it?

            <title><![CDATA[Original co-founder Michał Kiciński has acquired GOG.com from CD Projekt Group]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/03/original-co-founder-michal-kicinski-has-acquired-gog-com-from-cd-projekt-group/</link>
            <guid>1396366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The DRM-free PC game store <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gog">GOG</a> has been acquired by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt</a> and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński, branching it off from the CD Projekt Group and going private.</p>
<p>There’s no plans to change GOG’s business model, which continues to focus on providing a source for classic games, now with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">a dedicated preservation programme</a> to ensure a select library continue to run on modern systems, and to sell all titles (old and new) without DRM.</p>


<p>While now independent of CD Projekt Group, they have immediately penned a deal to ensure that CDPR games remain on GOG going forward.</p>
<p>So, why the change? Was GOG in trouble? All parties say that no, it was doing well and is profitable on its own terms, but the CDPR want to focus fully on developing games.</p>
<p>“With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move,” said Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD Projekt. “For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes.”</p>

<p>Kiciński was a co-founder of both CD Projekt in 1994, and then also their digital storefront Good Old Games (rebranded simply as GOG) in 2008. He left the company at the end of 2010, but has remained one of its largest shareholders, with 9.99%, and his brother is a chair on the board.</p>
<p>In the announcement, he said, “CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p>
<p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,” said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director of GOG. “In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>
