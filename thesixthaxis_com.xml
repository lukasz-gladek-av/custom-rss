		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced a trio of new games in a digital showcase for Tokyo Game Show 2025, all three of which can be played by visitors to the Makahuri Messe this weekend. From the residential care of D-topia, to musical RPG action of People of Note and classic action-adventuring of Demi and the Fractured Dream, let’s dive in:</p>
<h3>D-topia</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="D-topia | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Marumittu Games, assume the role of a resident maintenance worker at the D-topia residential facility, addressing citizen’s concerns, solving puzzles and uncovering secrets. Is this AI managed utopia everything it seems? There’s puzzle-adventuring with exploration and narrative choices that aims to get back to the human heart as opposed to the AI management.</p>

<h3>People of Note</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="People of Note | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note is a musical narrative adventure wrapped around a turn-based role-playing game. It’s a full-on musical with heartfelt song and choreography through musical sequences, but that’s also fed into the battle system and game mechanics through musical expressions and abilities.</p>
<h3>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Demi and the Fractured Dream | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Demi and the Fractured Dream is a tribute to classic action-adventure games from developer Yarn Owl, focusing on nostalgic hack and slash combat and environmental puzzle and platforming. Demi is a voidsent person who’s been born into the world of Somnus and is now seeking away to escape his fate, following a mysterious voice and helped by an acolyte on his adventure across dangerous lands.</p>

		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, a long-awaited remake of a classic entry in the series and a new spin-off to go alongside. The bundled pair will launch on 11th February 2026 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, PS4, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9rjoTdG_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 is exactly what you’d want it to be, a modernising remake of the first PS3 Yakuza game, revitalising another chapter in Kazuma Kiryu’s story for current consoles. While the game has been playable through a port of the PS3 era trilogy, it was a pretty sharp step back from the quality found in the PS4 remakes of the first two Yakuza games – Yakuza Kiwami and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> – which made use of newer game engines and technology built for Yakuza 0 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/16/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-review/">Yakuza 6</a>. Even those remakes are getting on a bit, though. Kiwami 2 was released way back in 2017 (and localised in 2018).</p>
<p>Still, Yakuza 3 did have its own innovations compared to the PS2 originals. Seamless Battle allowed for more connected fights without a loading screen, Chase Battle added higher paced fights through more environments, Revelation brought a new way to learn Heat Actions, and there was a first person view.</p>
<p>One of the great things here is that the Nintendo Switch 2 is being included on day one. Switch 2 owners had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/yakuza-0-directors-cut-review-switch-2/">an enhanced port of Yakuza 0 at console’s launch</a>, which is being followed up by a fresh port of Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 later this year. Clearly this was all part of the plan to bring this new audience up to speed in time for Kiwami 3!</p>

<p>Alongside the remake of Yakuza 3 is Dark Ties, telling a brand new story around the character Yoshitaka Mine. Here’s a little blurb:</p>
<p>Having once led a succesful startup company, he plunged himself into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat, and a variety of engaging side experiences.</p>
<p>Two men will walk different paths that converge to shake the very foundations of fate.</p>
