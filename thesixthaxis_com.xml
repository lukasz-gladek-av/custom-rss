		<p>Expression Games and Team 17 have announced a follow up to the 2021 WW2 multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a>, with this new game taking us to an altogether different war. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be set during the Vietnam War, which took place between 1965 to 1973, moving players from the battlefields of Europe to the jungle terrain of the South East Asian nation.</p>

<p>When Hell Let Loose: Vietnam launches it will feature six different maps where teams of 50 will face off against each other to fight for victory and, much like the original, communication between players will be essential to getting the advantage. The Vietnam War was fought in entirely different ways to WW2, and that means there are new additions coming to in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p>These additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>
<p>A release date for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is to be confirmed, but it will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Expression Games has also confirmed that the original Hell Let Loose will continue to get support and updates too.</p>

<p>Given just how persistent the calls are for Battlefield to return to a Vietnam War setting, this is bound to be a popular announcement. We’ll have a preview of the game shortly.</p>

<p>In our Hell Let Loose review, I wrote, <em>“Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.”</em></p>
