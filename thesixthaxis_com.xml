		<p>Inkle has just revealed Expelled!, a sequel to their reverse murder mystery <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overboard">Overboard!</a>, coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and iOS on 12th March.</p>
<p><iframe title="Expelled! Official trailer - release date announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzUjGieWQIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Someone has pushed a school prefect out of a window on the top floor of a school, and all fingers at this 1920s boarding school are being pointed right your way. Starring Amelia Tyler (Baldur’s Gate 3) as Verity, you have to find a way to reveal the “truth”, no matter the cost, trying to get away with the deed. Truth be told, I’m jumping to conclusions, considering the plot of Overboard!, so there’s a chance that Verity really didn’t do it – it does look quite 1920s Mean Girls.</p>
<p>You’ll have to get through the school day, talking to other characters, sneaking around and revealing the secrets of student and teachers to use to your advantage. But you’ll have to do your best not to be caught, with a simulated world where other character move and act independently and remember everything they see and hear you do. You’ll have to act fast and be smart to make it through the day without getting expelled.</p>
<p>A play-through will last for around 30-45 minutes, whether you succeed or fail, making this eminently replayable as you make your way through the story.</p>

<p>It’s all in the same vein as Overboard!, a game in which a lady has decided to give her husband the old heave ho, knocking him over the side of a ship and to his demise. She needs to try and get away with it, pinning the blame on one of the five other passengers in order to get the life insurance money – suicide won’t cut it for that!</p>
<p>Overboard was one of the highlights of 2021, building on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inkle">Inkle’s</a> storytelling pedigree with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/80-days">80 Days</a>, and Expelled! looks like it’s taking that core idea to the next level.</p>
