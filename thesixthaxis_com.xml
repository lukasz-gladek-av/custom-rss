		<p>What next for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer Poncle? Well, more Vampire Survivors, kind of. Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard is a first person dungeon crawler with a streak of playing tons and tons of cards from your hand.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and it’ll be a day one game into Game Pass. It’s expected for release in 2026, but poncle just say it’ll be along when it’s good and ready.</p>

<p>Speaking on Xbox Wire, Poncle founder Luca said, “This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs! The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff! With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on something, but we’re not talking about that just yet.”</p>
<p>Such a tease!</p>

		<p>IO Interactive shared a little glimpse of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview stream today, showing off about the car in the game… the Aston Martin Valhalla.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Aston Martin Valhalla Reveal | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0wLsLm8OlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Valhalla is stuffed with F1 technology and really slots into the supercar category in a way that probably feels a bit excessive for a spy, even of Bond’s stature. You’ll have to earn the number first, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all a little bit of a let down when thinking this would be a bigger gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>
<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

		<p>Mintrocket’s diving and sushi bar running sensation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver,</a> is out now for Xbox Series X|S, arriving as an Xbox Play Anywhere title that also nets you the game on PC via Microsoft and Xbox Cloud. This means you can play it on the Xbox ROG Ally X and Xbox Series after buying it once, which is nice.</p>
<p>Then, coming in early 2026, is a new expansion for the game that will take Dave over to the jungle. It’s quite simply called Into The Jungle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dave the Diver - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFbcVdZRKwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s been a couple years now since Dave the Diver arrived on PC. It was honoured with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/27/game-of-the-year-2023-best-pc-game-steam-deck/">Best PC Game award in our 2023 Game of the Year awards</a>, with Dom saying, <em>“With Dave the Diver you should prepare to be constantly surprised. On the surface, this is a game about diving with a portly man called Dave. You know he’s out of shape because everyone comments on it within the opening moments of the game, but it soon becomes clear that this is a man, and a game, with hidden depths.”</em></p>
