		<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been announced by The Coalition, which has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war">Gears of War</a> franchises is taking its first foray into being a multiplatform series. The game will be available from August 26th for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and PS5, making it the first time Gears of War has been made available on a PlayStation console.</p>

<p>Developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, Gears of War: Reloaded is a complete remaster of the original game, with this version supporting 4K resolution, 120 FPS support, and it will have cross-play across all platforms through the game’s two-player co-op campaign and 8-player versus multiplayer. Interestingly, no Microsoft will be required for cross-play, though signing in will enable cross-progressions for Campaign and multiplayer.</p>
<p>The full list of upgrades is as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>While the game coming to PS5 is obviously the biggest shocker, this is still great news for Xbox and PC fans in general. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition launched early in the Xbox One era, and was never updated to support the Xbox One X, so the game has been trapped at 1080p where Gears 4 and later had better compatibility through to Xbox Series X – through backward compatibility it did get 60fps, though. On PC Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the game has some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp1Rcvi01zo">major performance issues (per Digital Foundry)</a>, reportedly introduced through Windows 10 a few years ago. With this remaster, this brings the original game back into focus once more.</p>
<p>When Gears of War: Reloaded launches, all the DLC that has been available as part of the package including the bonus campaign the multiplayer maps, characters, and cosmetics. Those of you who bought <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> before today, 5th May, will get a free upgrade for Gears of War: Reloaded. Otherwise it will cost $39.99, though the game will be available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only Gears of War game in the works, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War: E-Day</a> in development as a prequel to this original game with previous series collaborators <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">People Can Fly co-developing</a>. The one thing that we can seemingly put to one side, though, is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/gears-of-war-collection-multiplayer/">the rumours of a Gears of War Collection remaster</a>, which was also rumoured for an August release.</p>
