		<p>Lion Shield has announced that players will be able to get their hands on the Roman city builder Nova Roma, with the date being January 22nd 2026. The Nova Roma early access release will be available on both Steam and Epic Game Store. The game is not just about mimicking Rome, but striking out and building an improved version.</p>

<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly.</p>
<p>Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>
