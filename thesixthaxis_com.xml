		<p>Nintendo has brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-boy">Game Boy</a> platformer Donkey Kong Land to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the company having remembered that there’s another rich vein of Rare’s DK adventures that had previously gone untapped.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Land – Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iYkwaVyGTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Donkey Kong Country trilogy from the SNES was added to Nintendo Switch Online library back in 2020, the celebrated platformers being a key part of Rare’s legacy from when they were a part of Nintendo. But alongside those games, they also released a trilogy of Game Boy games, following the naming convention of &nbsp;Super Mario Land to mark them as a bit different.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Land was released by Rare and Nintendo in 1995, ahead of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest, and while they couldn’t hope to capture the technicolor wonders of playing on a colour TV, they absolutely kept they same art style adapted to the green-tinted greyscale – greenscale? – of the original Game Boy screen. Add to that being able to retain a lot of the same platforming controls and style, and this was another hit for Rare.</p>
<p>There’s two more Donkey Kong Land games (plus a Japan-exclusive Game Boy Color port of the third game) that could be released in future, so keep an eye out for those!</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> Title Update 1.4.0, which makes a huge change for one of the most hated aspects of the game. Stealth sections have been revamped to remove instant fail conditions, letting players blast their way out of a sticky situation, instead of being booted back to a save point.</p>
<p>As well as removing this condition, the enemy AI has also been tweaked so that players will be better signalled if they’re being detected, letting them make the choice of whether to try and back up and get back into cover, or just reach for their blaster and start going for it.</p>


<p>Elsewhere, enemy weak points have been added to add some explosive new options, Kay’s blaster has been returned and you can use two-handed weapons more often, and there’s a new toggle for the cinematic lens, which could clean up the image for those who hate fake camera effects.</p>
<p>Hoping to bring a bunch more players into the fold, Ubisoft has chucked Star Wars Outlaws into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales this week, cutting 25% off the price of the game digitally. Of course, shops might have other ideas if they’ve got a few too many discs that they want to shift, so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>‘s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> update is here, with Polyphony Digital bundling the PS5 Pro enhancements in with a regular content update for the enduring racing game. So, in addition to higher quality visuals on the mid-gen upgraded console, there’s also five new cars to hop in and drive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - November 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OodQr_i9Ovs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>But for PS5 Pro owners, it’s the support for their new console that will be the most important thing. The PS5 Pro enhancements include a mode that combines visuals and performance modes of the base PS5, using PSSR to get smooth out any kinks in the process – though people were already able to get a huge performance boost at 120Hz even before this update.</p>
<p>Additionally you’re able to add ray traced reflections in race, with the option in the Display settings that lets you “Prioritize Ray Tracing/Resolution”. There’s also options for 8K resolution output here.</p>
<p>PSVR 2 owners will also get a boost with enhanced render quality in VR mode and smoother video playback by using reprojection.</p>

<p>Outside of that, you have five new cars – a Ford, a Merc, two Porches and a Suzuki – the Sophy AI has been added to Trial Mountain and Tokyo Expressway East Clockwise, there’s adjustments to the price of Legend Cars courtesy of Hagerty, and a smattering of other tweaks and fixes.</p>
