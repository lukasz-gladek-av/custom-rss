		<p>Another week is in the books, and we’re just a month away from Gamescom, so I’ve spent a good bit of time cleaving through emails and trying to put a sensible schedule together for previews and hands ons. Still some more to do on that front, but my calendar is pretty packed…</p>
<p>But enough about that, because with the cooler, wetter, windier weather, it’s been a good time for a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/le-mans-ultimate-v1-0-can-fill-my-endurance-racing-void-this-summer/">Le Mans Ultimate</a> to come out, luring me to put on my fancy hat to check out a game dedicated to one of my favourite sports. It’s pretty darned good!</p>
<p>With a poorly baby in the house, <strong>Nic</strong> hasn’t played much this week, but did give the new Pokémon puzzle game a quick try –&nbsp;“It’s not worth downloading…” So let’s move swiftly on to <strong>Jason</strong>, who’s been playing an awful lot of the “basically perfect” Monster Train 2, but has also jumped back into Final Fantasy XV after losing his enjoyment for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy old week for <strong>Steve</strong>, as usual, and he’s been playing an unholy mix of Hellclock, Once Upon a Puppet, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/s-p-l-i-t-review-hacking-horror/">s.p.l.i.t</a>, while also having another two indie horror games on his forthcoming review list. We can also add in the Chibi-Robo spiritual successor Misc. A Tiny Tale, the classic CRPG A Necromancer’s Tale and a certain 2D Ninja platformer. It’s lucky it’s not term time right now!</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> week has been filled with Neverwinter Nights 2 Remaster and Peglin for review, but he’s also been playing Death Stranding, Civ VI, Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>Having been able to sneak a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, <strong>Aran</strong> has also had Birdigo and Atomic Owl on the go for review. It’s a rather different sci-fi zombie and horror future for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, though, who’s been reviewing Killing Floor 3, and sinking back into The Callisto Protocol: “I think I’m on the last boss battle I’ve kinda enjoyed the whole thing. However I never ever, ever, ever, ever want to see a character stand on a platform only to have it give way under the so they are separated from their partner, ever again. The game does it about ten times!”</p>
<p>While he’d been looking forward to playing it, <strong>Ade</strong> was thoroughly underwhelmed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> –&nbsp;“Maybe I’m just all soulsliked out?” –&nbsp;so it’s good that he’s been able to move swiftly along to Achilles Survivor for review, which offers an Ancient Greece twist to the Vampire Survivors formula.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing his car combat quest with Twisted Metal World Tour, where he grabbed the platinum trophy. “It’s a shame the genre has been left behind – Sony’s Destruction All-Stars was a fun time even if it had some glaring flaws.” He’s also been playing Wildgate, which has a rough onboarding, but which he’s enjoying for its spaceship extraction shooter shenanigans.</p>

<p>And we come to <strong>Dom</strong> to wrap things up, and he’s been playing a mix of Donkey Kong Bananza, Wild Hearts S and the recklessly titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/super-mario-party-jamboree-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. There’s also been some CarX Street, and some real life chess, which I assume means he dressed up as a bishop, went to a field, and moved diagonally when someone told him to.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>
