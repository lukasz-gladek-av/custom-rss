		<p>Digital Sun has shared a little look at what’s coming down the line for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/moonlighter-2">Moonlighter 2</a> roadmap as it goes through Early Access, the team keen to emphasise that this game is being built in collaboration and around the feedback of its players.</p>

<p>There’s two content updates planned between now and the 1.0 release, which will have a further batch of things to do and the ending to the story.</p>
<p>The first content update will include a fifth challenge, a new skill tree at Eris, a balance patch for perks and relics, and general balancing and quality of life improvements. The second content up date will add a sixth challenge, a fourth shop level with more space, showcases and decorations, new patches, and a pet seller with new bonus-granting bloblets.</p>


<p>This is not set in stone, however, as Digital Sun explain that “additional mechanics, features, and improvements are planned, but we’re not sharing those just yet, as we want to hear more from you beforehand!”</p>
<p>Jason delved back into Moonlighter 2 for its early access, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">enjoyed the original game</a>. In his first impressions he said, “On the whole, I’m enjoying Moonlighter 2’s Early Access release. It’s a decent mechanical upgrade over the original game in the majority of areas, but it’s also fair to say that it’s losing a little something in the transition, and I find it a bit less whimsical. If you want more stuff to do and love a meta-grind though, then this game should satisfy that nicely.”</p>
