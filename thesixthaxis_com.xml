		<p>One of the most exciting projects we’ve been able to check out recently has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/prologue-go-wayback-playerunknowns-glimpse-of-a-digital-future-that-teaches-us-to-survive-in-the-present/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. There’s a whole host of reasons as to why it’s exciting, but the first amongst them is that it’s coming from PlayerUnknown Studios, the development team headed by Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene, known globally for the smash hit battle royale PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds, or PUBG. This new trailer is the first true taste of the game’s gameplay outside of our press viewing and selected beta testing. You should definitely join us in the excitement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Prologue uses procedural generation and machine learning to create an 8km by 8km map every single time you play. For context, that’s the same size as Skyrim’s map, and just as with Bethesda’s RPG hit, if you can see it, you can walk there. In fact, that’s the whole point of the game. Your task here is to survive, with each iteration of the map liable to cause you immense stress and strain as you fight against the elements, and your own hunger and thirst. You have to stay warm, dry, fed and watered, and that is far harder than you might first think.</p>
<p>Your task is to make it to the weather station. Each time you drop into the game you’ll start in a cabin, and the weather station will be somewhere between 3km and 6km away. There’s no mini-map, or route finding, you have to use an in-game physical map that your character holds up to read, while then referring to your compass to choose the direction. Just as you would in real life if you were lost in the woods, you have to navigate by the monuments and landscape details that you can see, finding other shacks or cabins along the way that hopefully contain better clothing or additional food to keep you going through the night.</p>


<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the perfect survival game, and it can really look quite beautiful, assuming you’re able to survive long enough to see it. Prologue: Go Way Back will release into Early Access this summer for PC.</p>
