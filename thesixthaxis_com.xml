		<p>It feels like I’ve spent most of this week playing the game ‘avoiding the Christmas crowds’, but I did get to enjoy my own version of Thanksgiving where I just watched NFL for six hours, and didn’t have to think about turkey for another month. In terms of gaming, I’ve been playing a truckload of Octopath Traveler 0, as well as some more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Tomb Raider Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Besides that, I’ve been checking out Assetto Corsa Rally, and messing with GeForce Now across a bunch of platforms to see how it performs.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/sweet-surrender-review/">Sweet Surrender</a> for review, as well as Halls of Torment and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Bizarrely keen to try and take on the Marvel Rivals PlayStation Cup challenge next week, <strong>Ade</strong> has been practicing by polished off his review of the retro-styled scrolling beat ’em up Marvel Cosmic Invasion. The embargo for that is on Monday, so check out his review then!</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has had a much quieter week. After flitting between a glut of new multiplayer games, he’s back to Ghost of Yotei as he focuses on finishing the main quest.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Duskpunk for review, which is a mix of Citizen Sleeper meets the rough life in a town full of opportunities and misfortune. Sounds great to me!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing the natural pairing of Terrifier: the Artcade game and Spongebob Square pants: Titans of the Tide. This weird gaming concoction has had mixed results, with Steve telling us, “The first was unfortunately pretty rubbish but the second is a solid, albeit short, 3D platformer” He continued, “With those wrapped, I’ve moved onto an indie space horror that’s been years in the making and is wonderfully atmospheric.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been curling himself up into a ball for an upcoming review, while also dabbling with some upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide DLC, and dipping into some cheap Black Friday sale pick ups, like Loop Hero.</p>
<p>And what about you? Have you played anything this week? Why not tell us about it!</p>

			<p>As a known lover of card games, it wasn’t especially surprising that Cross Blitz really appealed to me back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/29/cross-blitz-early-access-review-hearthstone-with-the-heart-of-a-lion/">when I first tried its Early Access launch</a>. Two whole years later, does it still feel as good now that it’s fully released? To put it simply, yes.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all busy people, I’m not going to lead you on, so if that’s all you wanted to know, then you’re done here, but do feel free to leave the page open for a few minutes to help our metrics, and maybe open a couple of other articles too. Thanks!</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an RPG deckbuilder with multiple modes and multiple stories to play through as campaigns, thanks to its cast of different characters. Each of these characters have their own starting decks, and different potential build options as you progress as well. You’re bound to find a character or two you love the most, but at the end of the day, I think they’re all very well-designed and a lot of fun. It’s incredibly cool to nip around maps getting not only upgrades, but also more story about them all as well.</p>


<p>Along with that though, there’s also a roguelike mode, and it’s what can give Cross Blitz a near unlimited lifespan, whether you’ve finished the stories and find yourself wanting a bit more, or just want to snack on the gameplay and aren’t in the mood for reading. Yes, reading is very good for all of us, but some of us get four hours sleep, work too much, and just wanna demolish some enemies, you know?</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t quite hit me in with the Early Access release is just how much Cross Blitz feels like a really polished Game Boy Advance game. I think it’s the visual style mostly, but the whole vibe could easily have been from 20 years ago, and I mean that as a truly gargantuan compliment. Cross Blitz just feels like it’s laser-focused on its core gameplay and deck-building, doing a lot without wasting excess tech on stuff it doesn’t need. It masters mechanics to allow you to min-max, and it wants you to do so to push through some of the hardest battles as well.</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an even better game now as it has even more to do, which is usually how these things go. The full release brings with it a new story campaign, which is in a similar vein to what’s come before, and it remains a lot of fun. The result is a more complete experience with even more cards and mechanics to mes around with, and just so much variety. It feels like you’re getting into the weeds with a really good TCG, but you don’t need to pay for all of it.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cross Blitz is a beautifully made deck builder that feels not only incredibly inventive, but also mechanically dense, and just very satisfying to sink into. On top of that, the looks are exceptionally charming, the music is good, and the vibes are just on point. If you love a good deckbuilder, then you’ll love this, but the campaign modes also mean that this could be the one that grabs you if you’ve only ever bounced off of others due to the roguelike focus.	</p></div>
