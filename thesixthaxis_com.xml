		<p>Sci-fi RTS Falling Frontier has been pushed to 2026, development studio Stutter Fox Studios has announced today. This is so the team can focus on implementing the systems properly as they head to develop a demo for Falling Frontier and hit Early Access. This is not the first delay for Final Frontier, having been delayed from 2022 to 2023, and then from 2023 to 2025.</p>

<p>While there has been a delay for Final Frontier, Stutter Fox Studios has been working on various systems as it ventures on its journey to bring the game to the public. The first port of call is the art of Falling Frontier, where the team has developed a shared colour language for ships so players can see understand their function at a glance, while also allowing for designs that reflect the factions the ships belong to. The combat system has been changed from arcade to more of a simulation with ships being able to fire thousands of rounds each minute, and when ships break apart you can see the individual decks within them. Explosions and destruction will be physics based with the team combining &nbsp;volumetric spheres with animated sprite sheets which use motion vectors which allows for a consistent visual flow no matter if you are zoomed in close or watching battles from afar.</p>
<p>Planets have been updated so they are no longer flat textures, with each now being fully 3D worlds populated with ridges, mountains, craters and ravines, and gas planets will have mesh driven volumetric systems. Players will be able to create planets at a later phase of Early Access with the release of the Scenario Editor. In the editor, players will also be able to edit ship colours so players can change the colours of the various factions to their own preferences. There are also pirate ships in the game which can have their own unique designs as well.</p>

<p>The development team has also wrote, <em>“That covers some of the main areas that have seen progress recently. Each part of the project has been about refining what is already there rather than adding more for the sake of it, and that work will continue as we move toward Early Access. If there are areas of development you would like to hear more about, let us know. We will be taking questions from the community to help decide what we cover in future updates, alongside the milestones we reach internally. Thank you to everyone who has continued to follow the project. Your support means a great deal and helps make it possible to bring this world to life the right way.”</em></p>
