		<p>Following its release for virtual reality at the end of 2024, Alien: Rogue Incursion is coming to PS5 and PC with a non-VR Evolved Edition launching on 30th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“FEAR HAS EVOLVED,” the trailer blurb declares. “Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition has been re-envisioned for PS5 &amp; PC in full HD at 60fps.”</p>
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion casts you as ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks, who’s intent on exposing Weyland-Yutani experiments on the planet Purdan. With a synth companion Davis 01 alongside her, you have to get into the research facility and then survive what you find there – xenomorphs, of course.</p>
<p>This is also described by developer Survios as part one of a two-part story, so while there is a conclusion to this story, there’s also a big cliffhanger leading to a sequel. This flatscreen launch no doubt intended to grow the game’s audience in anticipation of a second game.</p>

<p>Sadly, this wasn’t quite the Alien: Isolation VR successor that we hoped for with its initial launch. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">our review of the game on PSVR 2</a>, Tuffcub said, “I really wanted Alien: Rogue Incursion to be good and it starts so well, but then things just fall apart. There are many bad design decisions in the game so that you feel like you are fighting them rather than the Xenomorphs.”</p>
<p>Hopefully the Evolved Edition can improve upon and enhance the quirks and complaints we had.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/starbreeze-acquires-rights-to-self-publish-payday-3-from-plaion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has acquired the publishing rights to their co-op heist shooter from publisher Plaion, intending to self-publish the title going forward and accelerate the game’s continued support and development.</p>
<p>To fund this, Starbreeze is issuing new shares in the company, looking to boost capital by around 10% and raise 33 million SEK (which is roughly £2.55 million). 29 million SEK (~£2.24 million) is being used to repay Plaion for certain obligations.</p>


<p>“This agreement enables Starbreeze to fully acquire the publishing rights to PAYDAY 3 from Plaion, significantly accelerate our content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the PAYDAY franchise as a whole. We appreciate PLAION’s support, which underscores their confidence in Starbreeze’ future and strengthens our strategic alignment with major global industry players.” says Thomas Lindgren, Board Member of Starbreeze.</p>
<p>Despite the split, Starbreeze says that there could still be a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion for future Payday games and projects.</p>

<p>Payday 3 launched in late 2023, but failed to hit the highs and expectations from its predecessor. While it made a solid first impression – “a welcome return for the heist ’em up series, and a reminder of why the first two games were so popular,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">I wrote at the time</a> – it faced an uphill battle with its fans and launched into a much more competitive and time-demanding market for co-op games. After around 18 months of hefty reworks and patches, and the addition of the classic World First Bank heist in December it could be worth diving in. The game was a part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-payday-3-high-on-life/">PS Plus monthly games back in February</a>, and is currently on sale with <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/05/weekend-deal-consoles/">60% off on Xbox and PlayStation consoles</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/what-we-played-doom-the-dark-ages-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Another shortened week is in the bag, and for plenty of gamers the weekend can’t come soon enough. Game Pass subscribers in particular are getting a lot of good games of late, with Revenge of the Savage Planet now out on there and DOOM: The Dark Ages set to follow next week.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing both those games this past week, as well as the newly announced grand strategy epic of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/europa-universalis-5-preview-hands-on-eu5/">Europa Universalis V</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>… with me, funnily enough. We had a good fun time running around the multiple angry planets in this quirky Metroidvania sequel, but Dom took the lead and played a good bunch on his own as well. And for more of his alone time, there was Tetris and Spirit of the North 2.</p>

<p>While we’ve come to the end of the review train, <strong>Aran</strong> is closer to the start of his, playing the blacksmithing adventure of Blades of Fire – more on that sometime soonish. He’s also started a new save in Football Manager 24 with Ebbsfleet, who he’s dragged to a playoff spot for promotion to League 2.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> polished off some reviews of Kiborg and Spiritfall, a pair of roguelites with different levels of charm, and has also been really enjoying his time with Atomfall.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> been playing Oblivion Remastered, “which is great despite an awful loot system and repetitive and hard to navigate caves/dungeons”, and made starts on Split Fiction with his sister, on Sea of Stars for yet more RPG-ing, and Chains of Freedom.</p>

<p>And who’s this? A wild <strong>Reuben</strong> has dragged himself out of his most intense studies to play some games for a bit. He’s been playing older titles while waiting for new ones, finishing FUGA again and about to make a start on FUGA 2, what with the third one coming along soon, and has been refusing to play with “modern controls” or visuals while working through Tomb Raider I-III Remastered.</p>
<p>In total agreement with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">our 10/10 review</a>, <strong>Steve</strong> has been having a fantastic time with Clair Obscur, so much so that he’s doing all the&nbsp;Gestral trials and unlocked all the swimsuits – “for research purposes, of course”. Besides that, he’s still grinding through Lego Star Wars, and enjoyed the throwback that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/captain-blood-review-original-pirate-material/">Captain Blood</a>.</p>

<p>And finally we come to <strong>Miguel</strong>, who had the special task of reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and enjoyed it, even if not quite as much as DOOM Eternal. He’s also been carrying on with&nbsp;Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>
