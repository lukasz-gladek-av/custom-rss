		<p>We’re back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2026, and you can look at them in two ways. Either they fell just outside the top 20 and failed to break into the upper echelons, or they made it into the rarified air of the top half of our list. It’s a classic glass half empty/full situation, but either way, keep on reading for another eclectic mix of games including horror, action, strategy, and Batman.</p>
<h2>25 – Valor Mortis</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>As if warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries wasn’t brutal and dispassionate enough, as columns of men just march headlong into volley and cannon fire, One More Level’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a> twists it into an even worse situation. William is a soldier resurrected after death, only find himself confronting twisted versions of other soldiers as a plague descends upon Europe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis | Gameplay Trailer - The Crimson Plague" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjGtfrFmxxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis is a first person roguelike so expect to die a lot. As resurrections occur, William will learn new abilities and skills that can be utilised to take on twisted versions of soldiers, including historical figures. Those skills include using a variety of melee and ranged weapons, as well as fire to push back against enemies.</p>

<h2>24 – Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 2026</em></p>
<p>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">announced back in September</a>, bringing a different tone for Nintendo’s much loved tactical RPG series. What we do know about the game, and it isn’t much as Nintendo keeps details scarce, is that Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will centre around the Heroic Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave – Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The tone of this announcement indicates that this game is drawing inspiration from the classic Olympic Games of Ancient Greece along with the Coliseum and other influences of Ancient Rome. Then the name Fortune’s Weave lends itself to the image of the Fates weaving the Threads of Life, again from Greek mythology. We will have to wait to learn more about Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave, but it’s sure to be one of the biggest games for Switch 2 this year.</p>
<h2>23 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally aiming for a 2025 release, Frogwares confirmed in October that The Sinking City 2’s release would be pushed to early 2026 with more time being needed. This primarily due to the war in Ukraine, where Frogwares is based, with the studio having to deal with power outages and missile attacks from Russia.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtyEOb2IBZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> changes up the formula from The Sinking City, changing the game style from a primarily investigative affair to a survival horror experience. The setting is the drowning city of Arkham which is being consumed by the waves, and you can explore its crumbling mansions and hospitals on foot and by boat. Horrors lurk in all parts of Arkham and players are going to have to try to deal with them with scant resources and a limited inventory.</p>
<h2>22 – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 29th May 2026</em></p>
<p>Arkham is likely to be a significant part of our next game on the list too, but any horrors here won’t scare our protagonist so easily. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is going to be the biggest LEGO Batman game both in scope and depth. This is a celebration of all things Batman from the very beginning to his most modern iterations, with a Gotham City that moves with the times and is open to exploration however you see fit.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gets-a-new-trailer-stuffed-with-villains-and-heroes/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> draws from a history of Batman comics, shows, and movies to celebrate Batman, the Bat-family, and the villains that have all become iconic characters in their own right. The game itself will move through different generations, with key moments from the different eras providing a foundation for the game’s story. The story is not going to be the sole focus, with the open world Gotham City providing plenty of opportunities for Batman to stop criminals.</p>
<h2>21 – Stranger Than Heaven</h2>
<p><em>TBA – TBA</em></p>
<p>Originally going by its codename Project Century in 2024, it was back in June <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/rggs-project-century-revealed-as-stranger-than-heaven/">we got a new look at Stranger Than Heaven</a>, one of the big new games from Yakuza/Like A Dragon’s RGG Studio. Again details are still rather scarce about the gameplay we can expect from Stranger Than Fiction, but the trailer really sets a stylish tone.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What we do know about Stranger Than Heaven is that it will follow the story of Mako Daito, and it will be set across different time periods. It seems things will begin in 1915, but 1929 and 1943 have been confirmed as the other years in which the game will take place. The location will be the city of Osaka too. Hopefully we will find out more about Stranger Than Heaven soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Duel Corp. Early Access release date has been confirmed for January 21st]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/duel-corp-early-access-release-date-has-been-confirmed-for-january-21st/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dreameffect Entertainment has confirmed that its third person openworld soulslike Duel Corp. will be launching into early access on January 21st. Duel Corp. is described as having an MMO feel as you will be able to meet other players in the world, and tackle the game in co-op with up to three other players too. There is no linear story path with players working out what has happened by interacting with the various factions that populate Duel Corp’s world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Release Announcement #shorts" width="563" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iESGgcI-qY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the world of Duel Corp everyone has been cursed with darkened eyes which has also caused everyone to be immortal. This curse has also raised all of the dead that are a danger to the living. The factions in this world have been borne out of the fallout from the curse, with each faction having its own theories and ways of coping with the new reality. In this world, players will have access to an unrestricted class system so different builds can be experimented with to suit different playstyles. The world of Duel Corp will react to player actions. For example, destroying a caravan will mean a village does not get vital resources. This can be used to cause friction between different factions, or weaken the village so you can take it over yourself. It is not just villages that can be taken over, with cities ripe for conquering. There are co-op quests to take part in as well as 1v1 and 2v2 PvP encounters. Duel Corp also contains procedurally generated encounters that can have unique items and NPCs to encounter.</p>
<p>Duel Corp will be launched with a 20% discount, priced at $19.99.</p>
