		<p>Skeleton Crew and developer Panic Stations have announced Frog Sqwad, a slapstick physics-based multiplayer game for up to eight players.</p>
<p><iframe title="???? Frog Sqwad ???? Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2BGF12nGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a frog with a sticky tongue, and that’s how you’ll get around and solve puzzles in Frog Sqwad. You’ll swing from pipes, drag giant food through tunnels, catapult friends, grow in size to become a megafrog, and more. Why are you doing this? Why are you and all your buddies in the sewers? That’s because of the Swamp King.</p>
<p>The Swamp King is endlessly hungry, and will demand for more and more food each and every day. You’ll go on runs, trying to earn gold to unlock more physics toys and gadgets, and just try to keep meeting quota.</p>
<p>Frog Sqwad – this is seriously hard to type out and not get letters jumbled up – is the first project from newly founded studio Panic Stations, which has been founded by a clutch of ex-Fall Guys developers who just want to make co-op games.</p>

<p>This game – that’s much easier to type – will be launching in 2026, but wait! You can play it tomorrow! A Steam Playtest will start on 11th December and runs through the weekend.</p>
