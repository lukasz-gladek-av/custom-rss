		<p>Today’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has disappointingly been met with a wave of complaints from PC players over the game’s performance.</p>
<p>With the game’s Steam reviews rating sat at Mixed, Capcom has responded and offered some basic troubleshooting tips.</p>


<p>A post by the official Monster Hunter Status social media account says,&nbsp;“If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings.”</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry’s analysis</a> of the PC version of the game highlights a number of fundamental issues that they found with the game. In particular, there’s a very lengthy shader compilation stage that could last 13 minutes on a Ryzen 5 3600. The automatic graphics settings seemingly fail to handle adjusting texture quality to match available VRAM on 8GB cards (leading to hefty stutters), and even if that’s adjusted, they continued to see stutters during camera movement. Even with more than 8GB VRAM, they suggest keeping texture settings reduced at this time, and suspect that there’s some issues with GPU-based DirectStorage texture decompression overloading the hardware.</p>
<p>This seems to be a bit more than just needing to have your drivers updated, and it’s yet another wonky PC game release – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/01/spider-man-2-pc-port-gets-a-rough-reception-over-performance-and-graphical-issues/">Spider-Man 2</a> at the end of January. Here’s hoping that further driver updates and some game tweaks in updates can help with performance as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Still, here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Capcom’s troubleshooting steps</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for the game.</li>
<li>Update your Video/Graphics Drivers.</li>
<li>Check for Windows Updates and ensure all of the latest programs are installed to your OS.</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try performing a clean installation of the video driver set.</li>
<li>Update DirectX to the latest version.<br>
For details on how to update DirectX, please visit the Microsoft support page or Microsoft Download Center.</li>
<li>Add the game’s folder and files to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds\MonsterHunterWilds.exe</li>
<li>Add folder and files for Steam.exe to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
*Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe</li>
<li>Give administrator privileges to Steam.<br>
To run Steam.exe in administrator mode, right-click on the .exe file and select “Run as administrator.”</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try logging into your PC in administrator mode and then run the game’s execution file (MonsterHunterWilds.exe).</li>
<li>Verify the game’s files on Steam.<br>
To verify your game’s files, follow these steps:<br>
(1) Restart your computer and launch Steam.<br>
(2) From the “Library” section, right-click on the game, and select “Properties” from the menu.<br>
(3) Select the “Installed Files” tab and click the “Verify integrity of game files” button.<br>
(4) Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.<br>
Important: One or more files may fail to verify. The files that fail to verify are local configuration files that should not be replaced as part of this process. You can safely ignore this message. If problematic files were detected during this process, Steam will automatically download and / or replace those files.</li>
<li>Disable Compatibility Mode for “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” if enabled.<br>
(1) Right click on “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” located in the following folder:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
*The above is the default location.<br>
(2) Go to Properties<br>
(3) Open Compatibility tab<br>
(4) Untick “Run this program in compatibility mode for:”<br>
If the above does not resolve the issue, please disable the Compatibility Mode for “Steam.exe” located in the folder below.<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, please also try the troubleshooting steps on the Official Monster Hunter Wilds Troubleshooting &amp; Issue Reporting Thread posted on the Steam community page as they contain more detailed and additional steps that may help resolve your issue.<br>
*Some steps mentioned in this article is also mentioned in the troubleshooting guide below, but please try all the steps in the guide again.</li>
