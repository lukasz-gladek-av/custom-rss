		<p>Rebellion know more than anyone how satisfying it is to blow the nuts off a Nazi. While that might not particularly trailer-friendly fare, it’s safe to say we all know that’s the first thing that anyone is doing when Sniper Elite: Resistance launches on the 30th of January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. The second thing you might want to do is indulge in some of the all-new features that Rebellion are bringing to bear in this entry in the storied series, with a fresh new trailer here to give a deeper dive into them all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfhRzW2lUfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, there’s a new Operative in the shape of Harry Hawker – excellent alliteration there – and an all-new threat for you to overcome, and you can enjoy shooting Nazi’s in whatever body part you choose in either solo or online co-op. Bring a friend, then you can shoot Nazi’s in two places.</p>
<p>There’s also the new Propoganda missions, which are individually unlocked by discovering Propaganda posters hidden within the main Campaign. This new game mode lets you play as a Resistance fighter in thrilling quick-fire challenges against the clock and they look very cool indeed.</p>
<p>This is currently the only aspect of the game that we haven’t been able to check out, as Tef has been hands-on with it at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">Gamescom ’24</a> and at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-spending-the-night-in-lyon/">another event</a>. He came away suitably impressed, calling it “Stealth action comfort food”, before continuing, “Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.”</p>

<p>So there you have it. Watch the trailer, find your comrade, and prepare to shoot some Nazis in the nuts on the 30th of January, 2025.</p>

		<p>It’s the new year, and it seems as though game developers believe that in amongst all that spring cleaning and remodelling you’ll fancy a bit of digital renovation as well. Following this week’s earlier announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/learn-how-to-design-a-house-with-architect-life-a-house-design-simulator/">Architect Life: A Design Simulator</a>, it’s now the turn of your derelict local sports hall, with Sports Renovations from Goat Gamez set to arrive on March 27th for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPORTS RENOVATIONS - Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfU2BjKMeAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Published by Dear Villagers, Sports Renovations will set you on the path to sports-hall remodelling stardom, as you find yourself tasked with fixing up a series of dingy, broken and graffitied arenas and training facilities, using a variety of tools to bring them back up to code and ready for the next generation of sports stars to begin their journey.</p>
<p>There’s a heap of different tools available to you, nabbing a little pinch of Powerwash Simulator to help you clean things down, while providing you with what looks to be an oh-so-satisfying vacuum cleaner to suck up debris. Beyond that there’s a bucket for you to put rubbish in, and plenty of paint for you to daub on the walls of your facility. </p>
<p>The trailer showcases just how grimy things are when you start out, and the possible end product too, with gleaming new facilities that look absolutely fantastic. You get to design and lay everything out inside your venue too, placing rowing machines, exercise bikes and weight racks in just the right spot for your imaginary gym buddies.</p>


<p>The additional content here looks stellar, and there’s reams of historical sports memorabilia from posters through to trophies and even radio broadcasts to give you a window into sports history that’s unlike anything else out there. This sounds like an amazing idea, and I can’t wait to check it out when the game releases on the 27th of March.</p>
