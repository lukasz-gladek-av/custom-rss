		<p>Well, here’s an unexpected announcement. Thief is back and this time in VR form. Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is being developed by Vertigo Games, the team behind Arizona Sunshine and Metro Awakening, and it will take players back to The City. In this Thief game, players are the thief known as Magpie and she is on a mission to steal and find the secrets of this world.</p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says, <em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>As a Thief you have to be stealthy and precise. Pickpocketing, opening compartments, and lockpicking will all be part and parcel for success.</p>

		<p>A remaster of the 1997 PlayStation classic, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles has been revealed. The game is coming out for PS5 and PS4 on 30th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSC0eQdzM20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles can be enjoyed in two ways. There’s the enhanced version, which has somewhat modernised graphics, tweaked gameplay, full voice acting and more… but there’s also the original game which you can switch back to, if you want something classic –&nbsp;though it does have the War of the Lions translation wrapped around it.</p>

<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p><em>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS – The Ivalice Chronicles includes two different versions of the game: enhanced and classic. The enhanced version adds fully voiced dialogue, an optimized and updated UI, graphical improvements, and a number of other quality of life features. The classic version unites the graphics and gameplay of the original game with the renowned War of the Lions translation and includes convenient features such as auto save.</em></p>

		<p>Konami have dropped by Sony’s State of Play broadcast to deliver a new trailer for Silent Hill F, a reinvention of the franchise that is set in Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill f Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5m9uALtSyn0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“In the remote mountain town of Ebisugaoka, teenager Shimizu Hinako leads an unremarkable life—until a thick fog descends, transforming her once-familiar home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles, and battle horrifying entities to survive.”</p>
<p>“Faced with impossible decisions, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, confronting the horrors that await within the fog.”</p>
<p>The narrative has been written by Ryukishi07, renowned for his work on&nbsp;<em>Higurashi</em>&nbsp;<em>When They Cry</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Umineko</em>&nbsp;<em>When They Cry.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>“To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL,” he said. “It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It’s an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I’ve poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don’t think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.”</p>
<p>“To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind. It’s my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you’ll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.”</p>
<p>He is joined by celebrated illustrator and monster designer kera, and composer Akira Yamaoka who has scored the games for the last twenty five years.</p>
<p>Silent Hill F will launch on September 25th 2025 on PlayStation 5 and XBOX Series X|S consoles or on PC via Steam, Microsoft Store and the Epic Games Store.</p>
