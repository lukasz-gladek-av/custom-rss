		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has rather nonchalantly revealed that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> remake is on the way. Not only that, Bloober Team – the studio that worked on the recent Silent Hill 2 remake – is back on board.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher didn’t give us any more information, other than announcing that the project is now in development. However, it did give us another good look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill F</a>, with insights from the game’s developers.</p>


<p>They touched its core themes – namely the juxtaposition of gorgeous natural beauty with bone-chilling horror – and its Shōwa timeline, transporting players back to a Japan where customs and superstitions contrast the world of the original Silent Hill.</p>
<p>This new entry is being written by Ryūkishi07, a well known mangaka best known for his visual novel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Silent Hill F will feature a young female protagonist, Hinako, and delves into elements of psychological trauma, Japanese folklore, and health dose of trademark body horror.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the last mainline Silent Hill games with various spin-offs and no shortage of misfires. Following games such as lukewarm Downpour, the blighted HD Collection, and the PlayStation Vita exclusive Book of Memories, there was a short break before Konami stunned us with P.T. which was the last project Hideo Kojima (Snatcher, Policenauts, Metal Gear Solid) worked on before his departure from the company. More recent Silent Hill games include the The Short Message and Ascension which were both experimental titles that ultimately went nowhere, followed by Bloober Team’s celebrated Silent Hill 2 remake.</p>

<p>Silent Hill F launches later this year on September 25th and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>As for the Silent Hill Remake, it was likely greenlit shortly after the success of Bloober Team’s previous game, but there’s no indication on when it will release or on which platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/metal-gear-online-wont-return-for-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> isn’t making a comeback following speculation from its recent Summer Games Fest teaser. Instead, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will see the debut of a new multiplayer experience within the MGS universe: Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>This is a completely original mode and one that has a clear focus on hiding and using camouflage, no doubt inspired by the popular “prop hunt” subgenre. According to Konami, they assessed whether to created another Metal Gear Online title but ultimately decided against it due to the changing landscape of modern multiplayer games.</p>


<p>That’s not all that was revealed during Konami Press Start. The publisher fully revealed its Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Steam versions of the game. Meanwhile, Xbox users can test their skill in a new original Snake vs. Bomberman mode. In additional, the Secret Theatre feature will return with players able to collect special clips and videos dropped by enemies in-game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is Konami’s hotly anticipated remake of 2004’s stealth action prequel, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Originally developed by Kojima Productions, the game is being rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by one of Konami’s internal studios, in collaboration with Virtuos who recently launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Like any good remake, Delta will retain the iconic story, characters, and level designs of Snake Eater while significantly enhancing visuals and introducing gameplay improvements and quality of life features to better accommodate modern audiences.</p>
<p>MGS3 isn’t a direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty. Instead it dials the clock way back to the times of Cold War tensions between Russia and the United States with Naked Snake (Big Boss) dropping behind enemy lines with little more than a survival knife.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 28th, 2025.</p>
