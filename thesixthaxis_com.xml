		<p>The first update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now available alongside today’s full launch of the game. It’s a big one for PC gamers, with the addition of path tracing (AKA full ray tracing) for NVidia GPUs, but there’s also bug fixes across the game.</p>
<p>Path tracing completely replaces the game’s lighting and reflections using the ray tracing tech built into Nvidia GPUs, where the fallback mode is a hybrid that includes ray traced global illumination and more traditional techniques for light, reflections, shadows and the like. It will be equivalent to the path tracing option that was patched in for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>… and it’s similarly expensive on the GPU, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/indiana-jones-and-the-giant-circle-minimum-specs-recommended-ultra-pc-requirements-4k-ray-tracing/">MachineGames recommending GeForce RTX 40 Series cards</a> and requiring the use of upscaling.</p>


<p>Speaking of which, the only upscaling techniques are currently Nvidia’s DLSS and a generic TAAU, but AMD FSR will be added in a future update. Oh, and a pesky dynamic resolution bug that affected us when playing with an AMD GPU has also been fixed by this update.</p>
<p>Out now across PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and via certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>
