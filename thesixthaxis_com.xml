		<p>Merry Switchmas, one and all. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came out yesterday, so there’s been a burst of activity here, as those of us who have the latest Nintendo console in hand have got to playing a whole bunch of Mario Kart World, and checking out all the other games, new and old, that are on the system.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been the most-played game of mine on Switch 2, I’ve been bouncing back and forth between what feels like countless other games. I’m having to write down and keep track what I’m playing for the purposes of comparisons back to last gen.</p>
<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> been doing the same. alongside Mario Kart World, he’s quickly spun out reviews of the excellent anti-grav racer Fast Fusion, ran through Welcome Tour, and gave a middling review of “the game of waiting for the delivery person on Thursday.”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> has not been playing Switch 2, “because nobody bought me one, very rude”, and since he doesn’t feel like sharing beyond that, we’ll move right along to Gamoc, who finished Split Fiction with his sister last night, “which is still mechanically brilliant, though it’s story doesn’t do as well.” There’s also been Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, and the newly launched Atomfall DLC for a review sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been working on Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon for a review coming next week, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> had The Alters on the go for review as well.</p>
<p>Digging back through Resident Evil, <strong>Jim</strong> played through the Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village, “which offers a bizarre detour from the main game that supposedly sets up the next arc in the series.” He found it quite unsettling at times with the creepy mannequins. He also played some of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/">Nioh 3 demo</a>, which is a big evolution over past games, taking a bit of inspiration from Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As is tradition, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing many, many demos and will have a recommendation post up ready for the start of Next Fest. He also hopes to be joining the Switch 2-athon later today, but what else has he played? “I also enjoyed rattling through Spray Paint Simulator on Game Pass before making the perhaps unwise decision to start Metaphor: ReFantazio as if I have time for another huge JRPG at the moment..</p>

<p>Another Switch acolyte is <strong>Nic</strong>, but for him Mario Kart has been joined by Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and there’s Magic: The Gathering, of course.</p>
<p>There’s no Switch 2 for <strong>Miguel</strong>, but he’s played a few games that are on it, namely Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review/">Fantasy Life i</a>, joining those with Zenless Zone Zero and Elden Ring Nightrein.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tuffcub</strong> has made a start on our Death Stranding 2 review. That’s all he can say for now…</p>
<p>But what have you been playing this week?</p>
