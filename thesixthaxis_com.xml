		<p>As we’re already a month into 2026 – seriously, how did that happen? – we’re well on the path to salivating over the games we’re going to be playing over the course of the next year. In terms of fantasy action, Crimson Desert from Pearl Abyss is firmly installed at the top of our list, and the more we get to see of it, the more that excitement permeates TSA towers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This new 15-minute showcase presents a whole host of new details about the world of Pywel, the central hero Kliff, and how it all comes together in terms of gameplay. I was lucky enough to play Crimson Desert at Gamescom a couple of years ago, and despite it being extremely tough, I came away wanting to play more, and explore the beautiful world that Pearl Abyss are creating.</p>
<p>Pywel features sprawling wilderness, bustling cities, ancient ruins and diverse regions, all set against a backdrop of escalating conflict and supernatural danger. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia and the Crimson Desert, each offering its own stories, environments and challenges. While the main quest follows Kliff’s journey, you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p>
<p>Kliff is a warrior belonging to the Greymanes, a faction from the northern region of Pailune, known for their commitment to peace and unity. Crimson Desert begins in the aftermath of that peace being shattered, tasking Kliff with reuniting the Greymanes and reclaiming their homeland. As the journey expands, players discover that the fate of the entire continent is at stake.</p>

<p>As the story progresses, two additional playable characters join Kliff. Each of these characters will feature unique combat styles, skills and weapons, allowing players to experience exploration and combat in different ways. You have to assume that one of these will be a magic user of some sort, while the other may well be a ranger type, though we’ll have to wait and see for the next glimpse of the game!</p>
<p>Exploration plays a major role, with players able to traverse Pywel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. The massive open world will be filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest designed to reward player’s curiosity and discovery.</p>
<p>Combat encounters range from enemy soldiers and sorcerers to ferocious beasts and machines, testing players’ adaptability and skill. Powerful artifacts and equipment can be earned through quests, combat or exploration, while knowledge gathered from the world and its inhabitants provides clues and guidance, or even opens paths to acquire new skills.</p>
