		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>

<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>
