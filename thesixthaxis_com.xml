		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and Fae Farms developer Phoenix Labs has announced that they are laying off “the majority of the studio”, leaving the future of their two games seriously in doubt.</p>
<p>On a post to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn</a>, the studio writes:</p>


<p>Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.</p>
<p>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</p>

<p>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals – they are some of the best in the business.</p>
<p>The company had previously made significant cuts last year, with layoffs and project cancellations in May 2024 that were estimated to affect around 140 employees.</p>
<p>Our thoughts naturally go out to all of those now affected by these further layoffs, and we hope that, as dire as the games industry is looking right now, they’re able to find fresh work soon.</p>
<p>This latest announcement would suggest that ongoing development for Dauntless and Fae Farm will be seriously affected, and it remains to be seen if and how the company plans to support them going forward.</p>
<p>Dauntless was the studio’s biggest hit getting its full launch in 2019 and able to ride the wave of interest in the Monster Hunter formula. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/25/dauntless-review-2020-switch-ps4-xbox-mobile/">Dauntless review</a>, we said, “Although hardly original in its premise, Dauntless offers an extremely fun and accessible take on the monster-hunting roleplaying game. It wastes no time in throwing you straight into the action and while easy to pick up there’s plenty of depth there for fans of the genre. What’s more Dauntless is completely free to play, gracefully sidestepping those annoying monetisation pitfalls we’re so used to seeing.”</p>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s Early Access launch has felt a bit like trying to drive British roads over the last couple of years. There’s more potholes than you can shake a stick at, an endless string of road works as water pipes burst and need emergency repairs, as alt nets dig trenches for their own fibre networks, and more. Kunos Simulazioni’s games are lauded as some of the best driving and racing sims out there, but on day one that’s coming with more than a few rough edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, that’s exactly what Early Access is for. It’s there to let developers release early with a subset of content, an acceptance of bugs and issues, and a preview of what’s to come through a roadmap of updates. Even so, Assetto Corsa Evo has stalled at the starting line on some of its key features.</p>


<p>It’s a tale that’s practically as old as online gaming: server issues. Assetto Corsa Evo is planned to be an always online game, tying progression through the career, car unlocks and more to being logged in, much like we see in Gran Turismo 7. While this can be nominally justified to preserve the integrity of a game’s experience when seeing other players, when the servers don’t work (whether that’s launch day overloading or at the inevitable shutdown sometime in the next decade), it locks off major parts of the game. In Assetto Corsa Evo’s case, it meant the first batch of 20 cars was initially locked down to just 5 on day one, until Kunos hurriedly patched the game to make all cars available without the nascent career and driving academy.</p>
<p>Online features are now being separately stress tested through specific beta builds and time windows, working to build it back into the main branch of the game as soon as possible.</p>


<p>That’s far from the only issue at this point, with bugs in setting up racing wheels –&nbsp;though immediately recognised, there’s no obvious preset for my Fanatec CSL Elite and McLaren wheel, and I had to disable other controllers to have it recognised – some complaints over performance with the initial release, a general clunky sluggishness to the menus and making adjustments, and odd choices like listing each car’s livery as though it’s a separate vehicle.</p>
<p>A lot of that can and will be fixed over time, so it’s great to see that the main thing that matters – the physics and handling of the cars – is as accomplished and enjoyable as ever. There’s a good spread of cars included in this initial Early Access launch, from road cars (well, sporty versions of road cars like the Abarth 695 Biposto version of the souped-up Fiat 500) through to a Mercedes GT2. There’s no sign of the GT3 cars that were the star of Assetto Corsa Competizione, so there’s fewer apples-to-apples comparisons to make there.</p>
<p>Cars are generally rather grippy, and you can really get some of the heft that is inherent to the chunkier road cars in the game, like the BMW M4 CSL. At the same time, there’s Brands Hatch and Laguna Seca in the game from the off, both tracks with iconic precipitous drops that give you that stomach-dropping sense of lift as you try to go through them, and you really feel that through both the force feedback and the visuals, the weight of the car moving around through the corner.</p>

<p>The foundations are there, but there’s still plenty of work for Kunos to do for the simulation and the surrounding racing experience. The force feedback can be a bit inconsistent – not least because it sometimes doesn’t want to activate for the wheel – the AI when racing is not the most engaging and a bit dim. The graphics engine also comes off as nice and accomplished, this being a new self-developed engine from Kunos, instead of Unreal Engine as was used in Assetto Corsa Competizione.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Assetto Corsa EVO, both in terms of Kunos quickly racing to fix up the initial release of the game with online servers, career and events, and the path ahead to the full launch. Some of the biggest draws are some way off into the future, with things like the open world Eifel freeroam region around the Nurburgring, and the essential online multiplayer still to come.</p>
<p>As it stands, then, Assetto Corsa EVO is not yet an essential buy. It’s got a cut price for the Early Access launch, so it’s tempting to grab the game now and dabble with it, but as usual, you’ll also need to accept that it’s a rough draft – and rougher than expected at this point in time. It might not take too long, but there will be a wait for this to start to realise its potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>People Can Fly has revealed that they are a co-development partner for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, working alongside series leads The Coalition on the prequel third person shooter.</p>
<p>The Polish studio has historic ties to the franchise, having been a co-development partner to Epic Games through the original Gears of War trilogy, before then becoming lead developer on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review-xbox-360/">Gears of War: Judgment</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12m0bw1W_tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Gears of War: E-Day will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars.</p>
<p>CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said, “Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.”</p>

<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF added, “Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.”</p>
<p>This announcement will be a boost for the studio, which has had a difficult time of late. In December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">they laid off 120 employees</a> from a headcount of around 700, reduced their self-publishing strategy and scaled back on several projects. As a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, being able to announce a steady gig like Gears of War: E-Day will no doubt be a boost to their profile – there was a healthy bump yesterday, though<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PCF:WSE?window=MAX"> the stock’s trend has been downward since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>That said, their partnership with Microsoft was already known, having <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/310133/people-can-fly-selected-to-make-project-maverick-for-microsoft">confirmed work on a game codenamed Project Maverick back in 2023</a>. This was already expected to be a Gears of War project, given those historic ties, but has now been made clear.</p>
<p>The one thing that <em>isn’t</em> clear is what this means for a Gears of War: E-Day release window. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024</a>, but has no release date announced and was absent from the Developer_Direct stream last week.</p>
