		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic and Paraglacial have announced Fatekeeper, a new first-person fantasy RPG that is set to head into PC Early Access this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatekeeper | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9xHZodgC2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fatekeeper promises reactive combat, rich progression and a handcrafted world, inviting players to visit ancient battleground, ruins and forests to uncover relics and lore to what occurred in each area, shaping your adventure and facing enemies as you go.</p>
<p>While it has a narrative path to follow, the intention is to make exploration feel rewarding. Of course, you’ll have your own character progression to shape, mastering weapons and armour, and with every encounter and choice feeding into the overarching tale.</p>
<p>Fatekeeper is in development at new studio Paraglacial, which is formed by former Grimlore Games developers who worked on SpellForce 3. Grimlore Games, of course, is currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/titan-quest-2-early-access-release-date-is-today/">just went into Early Access today</a>!</p>

		<p>Who doesn’t like surprises? Having been teasing that a release date would be revealed during the THQ Nordic showcase, it was announced during the show that, actually, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a> Early Access launch is today! The game is out right now!</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grimlore are aiming to have the full launch of Titan Quest 2 in your hands by the end of 2026, and look to flesh the Early Access release out with a character creator, crafting and transmogrification, arcane abilities, new masteries and more. &nbsp;that let you wield your chosen armaments while appearing as heroic as a demigod. New masteries await, shrouded in mystery, offering paths of power not yet walked. Realms unseen and foes unknown gather beyond the mists, waiting for champions worthy of their wrath.</p>
<p>Those who are lured to the combat and action of ancient mythology will be greeted with a reduced price. The full 1.0 release will have a $49.99 / €49.99, but that is cut down to $29.99 / €29.99 during Early Access, and the first week comes with a 20% discount down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">Announced during the 2023 showcase,</a> Titan Quest 2 will be a true action RPG in the same vein as the original Titan Quest and the genre’s dominant series, Diablo. Still set within ancient Greek mythology, the game will feature its adventuring within picturesque open world environments, while battling everything from the Stymphalian birds to giant crabs.</p>

<p>Grimlore Games has been crafting the game with hand-composed enemies encounters, designing enemy types to have complimentary attacks and abilities, and then placing them together in ways that they can use actual tactics to come and have a go at you. Boss fights will then be unique encounters that challenge you with individual abilities and tactics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has announced a Sacred 2 Remaster, a modernised version of the 2008 action RPG, coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sacred 2 Remaster | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YzPPceRfyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remaster is in development by Jumpgate and SparklingBit, revitalising the game with high resolution textures and improved lighting effects, improved combat, a modernised UI, and bugfixes for the game. This will also include all of the expansions and updates previously released for the game, and I think you can see from the trailer that this will still look and feels like a game from 2008.</p>
<p>A prequel to the original Sacred, this game takes players to the world of Ancaria as it’s on the precipice of disaster. T-Energy, the power source that helped to bring prosperity to the world, has been twisted and corrupted to bring conflict and chaos. Six heroes step forward, each with their own path and story to explore in this world.</p>
