<p>Derek Kolstad, best known for writing the John Wick series, has penned the story with Liev Screiber voicing Sam Fisher. Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing new agent Zinnia McKenna, Janet Varney is voicing Anna Grimsdottir, and Joel Ouelette is Thunder. The story looks to be about a watch that contains a secret people are dying to find out about. Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has taken a while to hit our screens, with<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/"> the show first announced back in 2020.</a> A year later, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">the Splinter Cell Remake was in development ,&nbsp;</a>but there has been no significant update since.</p>
