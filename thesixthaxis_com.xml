			<p>It’s a hard life, being a rat. No one thinks you are cute, you get all the blame for the bubonic plague, and you have a tendency to get embroiled in vicious blood-thirsty wars with rival armies of animals. For an example of the latter, look no further than the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/04/tails-of-iron-review/">Tails of Iron</a>, which pitted Redgi and his anthropomorphic pals against ferocious bands of fearsome frogs. Now, with the frog menace having taken their last ribbit, it’s the turn of some undead Bats to invade a Ratty Kingdom. Thankfully for Redgi, this is not the southern kingdom that he rules over, instead, it’s the Rats of the North who get brutally murdered by an invading army. And they do, in outstandingly gory but oh-so-cute fashion, in the cataclysmic opening to Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2 | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Out 28th Jan - PC, PlayStation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mj-v3CHQK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who didn’t have the good fortune of playing through its fantastic forebear, Tails of Iron 2 is best summed up as a 2D Souls-like. The diminutive player character – a bearded, brutally-violent, yet surprisingly cuddly rat named Arlo – must hack and chop their way through a vast interconnected environment, taking on hordes of massive foes. The foes are glorious to behold, painted and animated in an arresting visual style.</p>


<p>This time out there’s an overarching wintry Game of Thrones aesthetic, which proves a suitably arresting theme. The species and enemies are far more varied and creative in this outing; cannibalistic were-owls, enormous killer snakes (from Arlo’s perspective at least), and undead wyvern-riding bat shamans are all a joy to dismember. Indeed, the vast array of baddies keep proceedings fresh as the hours of play tick by, demanding that the player is constantly identifying new attack patterns, finding the chinks in their foe’s armour and exploiting them to finally emerge bat-tered (pun absolutely intended) and victorious. The satisfaction these hard earned triumphs earn results in quite the squeak of exultation.</p>


<p>Make no mistakes, Tails of Iron 2 doesn’t pull any paws. This is a tough – and often deeply unfair – game. Arlo is pitted against ridiculous odds, again and again, running a gauntlet of overpowered opponents before the next save point is reached. Though, I’m pleased to report that Tails of Iron 2 benefits from a much-needed focus on accessibility.</p>
<p>There’s a very welcome easy mode that slows down enemy attacks, allowing a player to learn the attack patterns of enemies, improve their skills, and then reapply their newfound abilities on higher difficulties, if they so choose. Even better, easy mode can be toggled at any time, ensuring middle-aged gamers with fading reactions can still make it through to the credit. Something I’m deeply thankful for.</p>
<p>In combat, Arlo has to roll to dodge red coloured unstoppable attacks, just like Redgi before him. Yet something has gone awry with his ability to parry yellow-coloured attacks, the controller inputs feeling floatier and less precise than in the original game.&nbsp;Parrying now rarely works, all too often resulting in Arlo being mashed in the face with a mace. In fact, so naff is the mechanic that I entirely ignored parrying, opting to dodge every attack instead.</p>

<p>Avoiding parrying takes some of the complexity out of the original game’s rock, paper, scissor, approach to combat, leading to a less engaging experience. Still, at least the combat benefits from being more dynamic. Enemies are much more prone to dodge and weave around the combat zone, using flight to soar above Arol’s head or tunnelling to dig beneath Arlo’s paws, all of which serve to keep Arlo on his claws; mitigating some of the sedentary combat encounters that plagued the original.</p>
<p>Where Tails of Iron 2 really falls in comparison to the original game is due to a nasty bout of sequelitis bloat. It’s an affliction that plagues many an anticipated sequels, presenting as a cornucopia of unnecessary gameplay mechanics bolted, Frankenstein Monster-stye, onto the once lean framework of its predecessor. Take the new system of gathering resources to build new weapons and tools by way of an example; as it’s mostly pointless. Why bother making your own gear when the items found in chests, received for completing quests, and discovered discarded on oft-decapitated corpses, are so much better? Despite the game demanding I recruit blacksmiths and build forges through its main story quests, I rarely availed myself of their services. A shame, as an entire day-night cycle has been implemented for this outing, requiring you to hunt at the correct time to find certain enemies, yet – in my playthrough at least – I barely bothered with any of it.</p>

<p>Then there’s elemental damage. Every foe you meet will harness different elements to attempt to kill you. The idea being that you should gather resources to build specific armour that offers the appropriate elemental resistance. The problem is that no matter how awesome the armour looks, it’s still totally useless. Whatever armour you wear, pretty much every enemy will kill you in two hits. Why bother with armour when you are best off being nice and light to help dexterously dodge attacks? Again, an initially interesting mechanic is rendered moot through haphazard implementation.</p>
<p>Tracking was a much-highlighted addition in preview footage, with Arlo able discern foes traits before he meets them by observing the environment. Yet in practice this amounts to little more than finding one footprint and then being told everything about the enemy, including all their elemental weaknesses. Meanwhile, the grappling hook, which proved a tantalising tease in my preview, remains frustratingly limited in its usage, providing Arlo with a slightly faster means of navigating the environment, but little else. Those hopping to use the grappling hook to explore environment of greater height and scale will be left disappointed.</p>
<p>In short, this squeakquel is more of the same, which is a good thing, but it’s also lumbered with a bunch of underwhelming gumpf that doesn’t work as cohesively as it should, and that’s most definitely a bad thing.</p>

			<p>Just so we’re all clear on this: Nazis are the bad guys, alright? They might have been reduced to almost pantomime villains in TV, films and video games, but it says more about the world that those same video games are providing timely reminders on this fact. So anyway, here comes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, in which you get to do to those aforementioned baddies pretty much everything that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQVFZx7XX4">Samwise Gamgee would do to a potato</a>. And then some.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34d5T8PW0W0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s early 1944, and as the Allies prepare for D-Day, they’ve sent some of their top operatives behind enemy lines to prepare the way, link up with the French Resistance and disentangle any unexpected problems they might find. Taking place alongside Karl Fairburne’s mission in Sniper Elite 5, Resistance gives his regular co-op buddy character Harry Hawker a promotion to be the star of his own mission.</p>


<p>In many ways, Sniper Elite: Resistance feels like a standalone expansion to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/25/sniper-elite-5-review/">Sniper Elite 5</a>. It features a spin-off character, it’s the same stealth action gameplay in sandbox missions, and there’s very few new embellishments around that. And I’m totally fine with that. It arrives with the same asking price as Sniper Elite 5, which some might be dismayed at, but this is a full campaign of the same scope as its predecessor, far larger than anything found in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/07/sniper-elite-5-season-pass-2-starts-with-rough-landing-mission-the-mosin-nagant/">a Sniper Elite season pass or DLC</a>.</p>


<p>The core Sniper Elite experience is still so moreish, though. Dropped off on the edge of a large map, you’re given a main mission to complete –&nbsp;find a resistance informant, investigate a trainyard, and the like –&nbsp;an additional Kill List target to kill, with a bonus if you do so in a specific way, and further optional objectives to find and take on along the way.</p>
<p>My default way to play is to sneak through stages with a trusty Welrod in hand, trying to quietly and effectively take out enemies with this pistol or melee kills, only taking out my sniper rifle when there’s effective noise cover from rolling thunder, church bells, or a diesel motor that I’ve just sabotaged. Until it goes a bit wrong, I have to run and gun with SMG, die, and then reload from a save.</p>
<p>Of course, you can get much more creative than this, use more noise distractions, decoys, or booby traps. Or you can go in all guns blazing, trusting your rifle abilities to deal with the throngs of enemies drawn toward your last known positions, especially if someone trips the alarms.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll want to scavenge around for crowbar and bolt cutters to access electrical boxes or quickly bust through doors – though you can pick locks – and keys to more quietly open safes and objective points. There’s workbenches dotted through each level, each one unlocking new attachments and modifications and allowing you to switch up your loadout, but there’s also special limited ammo weapons which often come kitted out with silencers and other perks. Enemies will still hear a rifle crack from a silencer, though they reduce the audible range quite effectively.</p>

<p>It’s a solid campaign with a good blend of day and night missions, cities, mountains, remote facilities, and more. The main disappointment is when you encounter rougher edges that affect how you can play. In several places, I had clipping issues when trying to climb up stairs, or some invisible geometry in another location. Hopefully, these are ironed out quickly. More deeply rooted is the immersion-breaking way that characters auto-snap into position when doing a melee takedown, which makes the game feel older than it is.</p>
<p>The whole campaign can be played with a buddy character by your side, or with the optional Invasion mode where another player drops in as an adversary, sparking a tense game of cat and mouse, where both animals are armed with sniper rifles and can find clues on where the other one is. There’s also the more regular PvP multiplayer with a set of straightforward modes that include TDM, No Cross for the pure sniping gallery experience, and the multiplayer suite is rounded out with Survival for co-op horde mode play.</p>
<p>We weren’t able to try these modes out prior to release, but…. well, outside of any technical issues, they’re the same as Sniper Elite 5.</p>

<p>The one real addition to the formula are the Propaganda missions. Find a resistance poster while exploring the main missions and you unlock a small challenge mission to take on against the clock. They’re fine bitesized little experiences, but are only really small asides, instead of more significant ways to change up the action.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to that standalone expansion feeling. I do feel that, after Resistance, Rebellion needs to find the next evolution for this series. The fundamental form hasn’t really changed since the shift toward more sandbox levels in Sniper Elite 4, and it feels like the next game can take another leap. Whether that’s cribbing off Hitman’s homework for more replayable levels, going even more open world, or simply digging down to overhaul animations, polish and more, I don’t know.</p>

			<p>Robot Entertainment’s Orcs have a death wish. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a> is the fourth entry in the Orcs Must Die! franchise, and, alongside a wily exclamation mark, it brings with it the surety that you will be seeing off green-skinned hordes in a carefully cultivated range of violent and creative ways. This time, you can do it with even more of your friends. The formula remains as strong as ever, but beyond the increased multiplayer options, it feels exceedingly familiar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> began life as one of the darlings of Xbox Live Arcade, bringing together third-person action and tower defence in a crazy, colourful way. You’re tasked with protecting the rift, a magical portal that the Orcs are inexplicably drawn towards without any care for their own safety. They’re so focused on the task at hand that you can lay down knee-high barriers that will blindly force them to take a different route towards the rift, and if you’re smart about it, you can also pop myriad traps and horrible contraptions in their way so that they, you know… die. Oh… wait, Die!</p>


<p>That formula remains largely unchanged in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap. The levels have been stretched out to accommodate up to four players, though if you’re playing on your own, they’re still approachable. There’s now a broader range of ways to kill the Orcs, though the classic spike traps and wall-mounted arrow launchers are as effective and iconic as ever, which makes them surprisingly hard to leave behind.</p>


<p>There’s six different War Mages to choose from at the outset, each of which has their own unique look, individual abilities and weaponry to fight in addition to their traps. The strange thing is, I don’t think that all of these hero characters have been given the same love and attention. The giant war mage bear, Kalos, looks fantastic, plays well, has weaponry that feels as though it’s making some impact and his special abilities prove genuinely useful during a mission by healing you and your team. Mac, meanwhile, not only looks rough – they’re part android with a massive wrench – but their special ability just lets you float really high. There’s also a cat called Sophie who speaks in a standard human voice and without any attempt at cat puns.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame that there isn’t more variety to the hero characters, especially when a team of four different players can use up the entire roster in one sitting. I understand that these are not easy or simple things to create, balance or design, but when the game itself has shifted to a multiplayer focus, I was left wanting more, particularly when some of those that are included just aren’t as much fun to play as. Still with Kalos and Vaan, I had my favourites.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of opportunities for progression in Deathtrap, from character-specific upgrades to an overarching skill tree that covers all of your War Mages. These start out minimal – we’re talking 5% on average – but these build and grow into some serious buffs. There are plenty of other ways to change your fate too, and your possibilities. Alongside expanding your choice of traps, there’s also the Thread Shop. Threads appear following each wave, and they bring a range of buffs or debuffs that might make things harder for you, or easier for you on each run.</p>
<p>I particularly like weighing up the pros and cons of these, and discussing it with my teammates became a key part of our planning and progression. Early on in one run I essentially gave up being able to lay traps in order to gain extra barricades, but it was a short-term gain, and we avoided that Thread for every following run until we could plan and compensate. Other, more useful Threads increase the damage of different traps or the effectiveness of your War Mage’s abilities, and it’s fun to stack these together.</p>
<p>Finishing one successful mission lets you gamble some of the Skulls you’ve earned and carry them, and your Threads, forward, building your run in a Roguelike style. It’s effective and enjoyable, though losing out by gambling can be crushing when it feels as though there’s so many places to spend your Skulls.</p>

<p>I disliked the size of the castle hub that serves as your base, and it’s not characterful enough to earn the time you spend wandering between the different upgrade merchants. If you compare it with Monster Hunter – arguably one of the best series to showcase progressively-expanding central hubs – Deathtrap’s castle feels lifeless in comparison. It could have been much more focused. Or just a menu.</p>
<p>For all of these minor complaints, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap still feels like a lot of fun to play, especially with a team of four like-minded friends. It’s collaborative, amusing and action-packed, and it still retains much of the series most enjoyable aspects, like yeeting an orc across a map right into a pit of lava, skewering them with multiple pointy things at the same time, and then sending them back around to do it all again.</p>
