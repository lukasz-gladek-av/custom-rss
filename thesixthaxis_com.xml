		<p>“Yeah, but is it fun?” That’s the question that so often burns into any discussion of a new and upcoming game. You can absolutely have tense and gruelling experiences, explore traumatic narratives, and do so with cutting edge graphics, but so many games put pure enjoyment, fun and satisfying feel first and foremost.</p>
<p>So… which games felt the best and most fun for us in 2024?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> is picking up so many awards this year is that pretty much anyone can play it. If you are old enough to use a controller you can enjoy it, and the mechanics are so simple that anyone can understand them.</p>
<p>Each world brings something new with Astro Bot joined by a companion that enhances his skills in some fashion, floating like a balloon or turning into an indestructible spikey ball. It’s then simple logic – and real world logic at that – which allows you to progress. You need to get higher? Turn into the balloon and float up, simple. There’s no faffing about with special powers or complex button pushing, a single button press and you are on your way. As you progress through the world the use of the power up becomes more integral and you learn how to use it more subtly, culminating in a boss battle that requires you use all the knowledge you have gained over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Astro Bot is also insanely addictive, where finishing the game is just the first step. You then still have the challenge modes and the delightful task of rescuing all the Astro Bots from the many PlayStation games and watching them interact,</p>
<p>Let’s not pretend Astro Bot invented platforming, Nintendo have that honour with Donkey Kong, but Team Asobi have delivered another perfect example of the genre.</p>

<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If you’re expecting Balatro to play like a familiar game of Texas hold ’em, then you’ve got another thing coming. Thankfully, that thing is a gorgeously put together roguelite deckbuilder that riffs on poker, rummy, solitaire and so much more. Each stage (blind) that you take on has a score target, where you play hands that dish out chips per card value and multiply that score based on the hand, Joker card modifiers and more.</p>
<p>It’s a satisfying puzzle to unpick, the scores you chase constantly growing, the multipliers increasing, and the oddball modifiers from boss blinds, conditional Jokers and more.</p>
<p>– Stefan L</p>
<h2>3D Don’t Die, Mr. Robot – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If there was one thing I was not expecting this year, it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/3d-dont-die-mr-robot-review/">3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot</a> being one of the best-playing new games of 2024. A sequel to Don’t Die, Mr Robot, this game is just pure arcade vibes. There’s no story to worry about, no worrying about your character build or gear stats. It is just you, a robot, lots of enemies, and exploding fruit as you chase high scores. 3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot challenges your reactions while wrapped up in an approachable package, with levels that get steadily tougher until you realise a few hours have passed by as you try to chase a level’s platinum trophy.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has released a new special trailer for BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, with the sole focus of this trailer being the character Shinji Hirako. It is around two minutes long, with Shinji saying some iconic lines which are voiced by Aleks Le. The trailer also shows the character Hiyori, though going by the gameplay it seems Hiyori will be a move summon for Shinji, rather than a standalone character. However, that could change.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls — Shinji Hirako Special Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAY1-pUCX2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Shinji is a captain and one of the Visored, which could mean more of the Visored are going to be added to the roster too. Like the other characters on the roster, Shinji will be able to launch powerful attacks to shift momentum if he is close to being defeated. It is something that will be a core element of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls gameplay.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, with the confirmed platforms being PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
