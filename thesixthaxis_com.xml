<p>In Forever Skies, players return to Earth as a scientist to discover what caused the loss of humanity’s home and what has changed. Earth has suffered an ecological disaster that forced humans to build massive towers to escape the problems of the surface, but that was not enough leading to an exodus from the planet. As the scientist you will pick through the ruins to find lost technology and repurpose it, as well as find ways to create food, and survive against Earth’s new inhabitants. Players will be living on airship that can be upgraded and customised, acting as the base of operations for the scientist.</p>
