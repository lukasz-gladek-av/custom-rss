		<p>A new cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> has been released, introducing the Orks to the game in pretty much perfect fashion. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Official Ork Faction Trailer | IGN First" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pF5eVltokAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Gork or Mork-ified space hulk that the Orks are cruising through space on has been kitted out with a big red button so that they can, to quote the Warboss that punches it, “crash faster” into the planet while in hot pursuit &nbsp;of the Blood Ravens Space Marines that they’re chasing after.</p>
<p>It’s the culmination of a wonderfully rendered cinematic trailer that sees the Orks attack an Imperial ship and board it to go toe-to-toe with the Space Marines, who are eventually forced to abandon ship of drop pods and Thunderhawks.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably want to see the actual game in action at this point, and King Art Games have done that too in the last few weeks with the ‘Sons of Caliban’ gameplay trailer released in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - &quot;Sons of Caliban&quot; Dark Angels Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGC_MKhAGzg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This shows off the Dark Angels chapter in action, not long after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-reveals-a-dark-angels-team-up/">their own cinematic trailer reveal</a>. As formidable as a Space Marine Chapter is, the Blood Ravens are in dire need of help through Dawn of War 4, and the Dark Angels themselves are turning up to assist.&nbsp;You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. King Art have also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>
<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

		<p>Having rattled off a multitude of our most wanted video game releases of 2026, let’s keep the train rolling. As we enter our top 20, we see the return of some familiar faces as well as some exciting new IP fresh out of Japan. Why don’t we kick off with our first Capcom game on the list?</p>
<h2>20 – Pragmata</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 24th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally thought to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> is a new sci-fi action adventure from the Monster Hunter and Street Fighter publisher. You play as Hugh and Diana, an astronaut and his android companion looking to uncover the mysteries of a lunar research station that has been overrun by hostile artificial intelligence. The protagonists have a symbiotic relationship that weaves its way into Pragmata’s combat, navigation, and puzzle-solving gameplay with Hugh doing the heavy lifting as Diana employs her hacking abilities right in the middle of battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To explain what that’s all about, we went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> last year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy.”</p>

<p>There’s a demo currently available on PC, which will hopefully make its way to consoles ahead of its launch this Spring.</p>
<h2>19 – Romeo Is A Dead Man</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 11th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The latest game to come from the wonderfully wacky mind of Suda51 and the Grasshopper Manufacture studio, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> knows its audience. Seriously, just go and watch the announcement trailer. For those who love the ultra-violent, super-stylish No More Heroes series, this feels like somewhat of an evolution, dialling the strangeness factor up to 11 as players assume the role of Romeo Stargazer, a reanimated space-time FBI agent tasked with hunting fugitives across the cosmos. The game already looks to have a memorably twisted cast of fun characters – let’s just hope that, amidst the on screen carnage, there’s a decent action game in there too.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>18 – The Duskbloods</h2>
<p><em>Nintendo Switch – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>For the umpteenth time, no, this isn’t <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne 2</a>. Nintendo and FromSoftware certainly had us going there for a minute during their announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> Direct showcase. The gothic, Yharnam-like setting and haunting atmosphere seemed to suggest that Nintendo had somehow swept Bloodborne out of Sony’s clutches, but this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a FromSoftware joint, The Duskbloods will naturally inherit some of that Bloodborne DNA, though there are some key distinctions. Firstly, there are vampires. Secondly, it’s a primarily multiplayer game, featuring online PvPvE. Following the success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, it will be interesting to watch FromSoftware continue to pursue its live service gaming ambitions alongside its more traditional brand of action RPG.</p>
<h2>17 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Oh, to have the patience of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> superfan. It’s been 15 long years since the last main entry in this once-beloved Xbox series and while Fable wasn’t perfect (missing many of the lofty features promised by zany franchiser frontman, Peter Molyneux) it felt like a mainstay in the RPG. Until it completely vanished, of course, leaving behind a trail of half-baked spin-offs and the wisp of dream that one day we might see a Fable 4. The wait is finally almost over, hopefully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">a sequel or reboot scheduled to launch sometime this year.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Release Window Trailer | Xbox Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6sREGbfzRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides some pre-alpha footage we’ve seen very little of the game in action, though it looks to retain that familiar high fantasy vibe with plenty of witty humour and monster-slaying as players return to Albion.</p>
<h2>16 – Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will be celebrating its eighth anniversary later this year. It’s also hard to imagine that 2026 will see yet another reincarnation of gaming’s favourite gunslinging archaeologist, first appearing in a remake of Lara Croft’s original adventure.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-reimagines-laras-original-adventure/">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a> will offer a complete modernisation of the first game, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and starring new lead actress, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also take lead in next year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>.</p>
