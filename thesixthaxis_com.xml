		<p>Krafton’s top-down tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg-blindspot">PUBG: Blindspot</a> is out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam Early Access</a>, and it’s a free-to-play game that’s worth checking out for fans of this kind of genre.</p>

<p>PUBG: Blindspot might share the branding of the hit battle royale, but it’s a totally different style of game. This is a 5v5 team shooter that’s all about lines of sight with a shared team vision, controlling angles and close quarters combat with an element of destruction. New content is already planned, including the defence character Blaze, the addition of Molotov Cocktails for area control.</p>
<p>The early access launch is the start of open development that will take on feedback from the player base to inform the updates, balance and future updates. It’s available for free at this time, and per the FAQ on Steam, it’s planned to stay in early access for around one year, after which Krafton “plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items.”&nbsp;The game will almost immediately kick into a seasonal structure, with Competitive Season 1 launching on 12th February.</p>
<p>“Early Access allows players to become active participants in the development process,” said Seungmyeong Yang, Production Director of PUBG: BLINDSPOT. “By launching as a free-to-play title and developing openly with the community, we aim to shape PUBG: BLINDSPOT together through ongoing communication and frequent updates.”</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this game late in 2024 saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>
