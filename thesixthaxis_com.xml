			<p>You can’t talk about Wild Hearts S without understanding what’s gone before. This Switch 2 port comes some two years after Koei Tecmo’s ambitious hunting game appeared on other platforms, taking the monster hunting formula that Capcom originated, and building something that retained enough of the familiar framework, while creating new gameplay experiences within it.</p>
<p>It did an excellent job of it too, with Wild Hearts right up there as the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had. Here, Wild Hearts S brings the game to Nintendo’s brand-new portable, retaining all of the game’s previous updates and improvements, expanding the original’s three-player parties to four, while shrinking and compressing everything down for the portable platform. In doing so, it’s not necessarily the best place to play, but in a post-Monster Hunter Wilds world, Wild Hearts S sets out its stall as a compelling alternative.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Wild Hearts pushed its platforms to the limit. I’ve played on PC and PlayStation 5, and while my PC brute-forced its way through many of the more challenging sections, the PlayStation 5 version looked decidedly less polished than you’d expect. Some of that was due to the scale and detail that Koei Tecmo pumped into each area, as well as the incredible monster design, while some of it was poor optimisation. It’s fair to say that these issues persist in the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>As a game that’s been out for a couple of years, and which has received a steady stream of updates, I was expecting a flawless experience on Switch 2. That has, however, not been the case. The frame rate drops below 30fps, stuttering through heavily detailed, larger areas, while there’s visible pop-in as assets stream into place. That’s on top of lacklustre snow effects, flat or reduced textures and a visual grain that makes everything look that bit less detailed. It’s not a great look on the new Nintendo hardware.</p>

<p>That said, it runs well enough the rest of the time, the majority of the central action feeling quick, challenging and enveloping, particularly when playing on handheld, which smooths out some of the issues.</p>

<p>This is a hunting game. The central loop sees you take your character into a large, distinct area, seeking out one of the insanely large, naturalistic monsters known as Kemono, and then whittling down its health with a series of sword, hammer, or spiky umbrella strikes. Killing them grants you a bevy of monster bits that you can then use to make new weapons and armour. So far, so Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>The added wrinkle here is the Karakuri. You can conjure up hunting tools to aid you in battle, and while these start off as a series of crates that you can clamber up and leap off of, they soon expand into barriers, weaponry and traversal tools, with an exciting and interesting combo system that gives hunts a new, more frantic and freeform feel, clearly differentiating Wild Hearts from its inspiration.</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S’ Japanese-style setting still makes it feel like a companion to Monster Hunter Rise, both exploring the mythology and potential of that setting, while playing with the core hunting mechanics. Wild Hearts S is less bombastic, and manages to make its characters that little bit more compelling, a touch more human, than Capcom’s, though it lacks the solidity and assurance of Rise’s well-established monster roster and mythology.</p>

<p>It’s Monster Hunter Wilds, though, that is currently on the minds of hunting fans. The clear advantage that Hearts S has over it is its difficulty level. While it streamlines some of the aspects of Monster Hunter, giving you options to help locate your prey, and doing away with crafting for health potions and other items, Wild Hearts S boasts a series of creatures that will decimate your health if you’re not incredibly tuned in and aware. You need to grind for parts, upgrade your equipment, then snatch the correct moment to attack, bring the Karakuri to bear at just the right time, and it feels, for all intents and purposes, like an older Monster Hunter game. Wilds is brilliant, but, it’s not hard enough. Wild Hearts S is.</p>
<p>While Koei Tecmo have expanded the hunting party size to four for Wild Hearts S, there’s no crossplay available with the other platforms, making it feel strangely lonely for a multiplayer title. I’m sure that new Switch 2 owners looking for a Monster Hunter kick will find a lot to like in Wild Hearts S, but sticking with three players or updating the other consoles to match the new four player count and having crossplay would have helped Koei Tecmo establish a wider community for the game.</p>

		<p>The universe is, once again, at risk. In Out of Time, a brand new multiplayer roguelike from Manticore Games, it’s not a massive purple alien with a glowing golden gauntlet, or a black hole that’s threatening to suck everything in, but The Shattering, a catastrophic event that’s destroying all time. Since time is, well, relatively important, it’s up to you and your plucky band of friends to try to set things right. Seemingly, you do that by smashing loads of bad guys in the face. Sounds good, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Out of Time Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epUf3v8GnUk?start=64&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Thanks to The Shattering, all of space and time has been mashed together, meaning that there’s really no reason you can’t have a knight, a robot and a dinosaur all meeting up in a medieval castle, and, frankly, that sounds pretty cool.</p>
<p>Talking about the game, Jordan Maynard, the Chief Creative Officer at Manticore says, “With&nbsp;<em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids”, he continues, “The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!”</p>


<p>In terms of setting, Manticore might well be onto something here, and time travel remains one of sci-fi and fantasy’s most compelling devices for some serious shenanigans. As a roguelike, you have to assume that death will be on the cards repeatedly, but that you’ll be upgrading your character’s skills while grabbing as much loot from each time period as humanly possible. The trailer sees the action hopping from a medieval setting with a fire-breathing dragon to a present-day 2025 one, before ending in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with a clear focus on teamwork to fend off the badniks. All in all, it looks like plenty of fun!</p>
<p>Out of Time will launch for PC exclusively via the Epic Game Store this Autumn, with a very reasonable pricepoint of $24.99.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, our technology is designed purely to perform a function, but most companies also try to make things look good at the same time, like the Edifier QR65 Active Monitor. This is a speaker set with multiple connection options and powerful audio, but it’s the RGB lighting that make this a showstopping feature for any computer or living room setup.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edifier QR65 - Desktop Active Monitor with GaN Charger" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pO4l_RsIvJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Edifier QR65 immediately feels like a high-quality premium product thanks to the classy white packaging they arrive in. Pulling them from the box reveals two chunky speaker units, with our review unit coming in black, soft-touch leatherette, the two drivers set within a glass panel at the front, the Edifier logo sitting beneath. The QR65 also come with additional silver stands to angle them upwards, each embossed with ‘A Passion For Sound’. There’s plenty of weight to each of the speakers, and first impressions are very strong. This is good considering the £329.99/$369.99 price tag.</p>


<p>The QR65 comes with an impressive list of features, starting with the 70W power output, Hi-Res Audio classification, digital and analogue wired inputs, through to Bluetooth 5.3 with the ability to accept the Hi-Res LDAC codec and three GaN 65W charging ports for your other devices. If you’re looking for a set that’s going to sit of the centre of the multimedia experience, it’s a great start.</p>
<p>The RGB lighting is the key selling point, though. The Edifier QR65 are stunning, with a mirrored infinity view-styled design seeing the coloured bands of light disappearing into the speaker unit themselves. There’s an array of different lighting effects available as well, capable of cycling through different colourways, and effects including breathing, cascade and solid. My favourite are the reactive effects though, with the lighting moving and shifting in time with the music or audio you’re playing.</p>


<p>They also serve as a visual representation of the volume control, the banding rolling around the speaker front as you turn the dial or increase your Bluetooth volume. Visually, these are amongst the best speakers out there, providing far more of a focal point than most of the unassuming speakers out there.</p>
<p>Control is via a sleek metal panel on the right-hand speaker unit. This houses a power button which takes double duty, cycling through the different input settings of Bluetooth, USB and line in. The top dial is your multimedia control, controlling volume, while one quick press serves as Play/Pause. The second dial controls the light effects, rotating through a series of different options, while the button control lets you switch into changing the brightness of the lighting. It’s about as refined as you’ll likely to get, though for the setup on my desk, it did mean the controls were tucked away in a corner.</p>
<p>You likely won’t be needing to use the controls all that much though, with all of the multimedia devices you’re likely to be linking able to control the volume that’s being input to them. There’s also the Edifier Connex app – available for Android and iOS – which lets you make changes to the speaker setup and its lighting in a clearer, and more bespoke way.</p>
<p>Here you can choose specific colourways, helping to make sure everything in your setup matches, and there’s a simple setup here, with presets to choose from, or a whole three colour gradient option to choose the exact colour you want. You can also dig further into the speaker’s setup here, activating the Bluetooth LDAC codec, checking out charging rates and more.</p>

<p>Connecting the QR65 is as straightforward as you’d hope, with the multiple ports at the back of the right-hand speaker unit doing exactly what they should. Connecting to PC was easy, with the speakers appearing as a output device the moment it was plugged in. It’s worth noting that the most frustrating piece of design of the whole unit is the coloured RGB that’s supposed to indicate what connection type it’s connected to. It’s a single light, and if you’ve forgotten what it was most recently set to, you can end up pressing it more times than entirely necessary. A switch selector would have been much clearer.</p>
<p>The audio output sounds as good as you’d expect for a speaker set that costs north of £300. This is a beautifully detailed speaker set, with plenty of heft and bottom end provided by the bass ports on the rear of each speaker unit. I’ve been playing the new Sleep Token album almost exclusively for weeks, and you’re able to pick out the elements of each instrument, whether it’s the plaintive piano notes and delicate vocal moments or the heavy-hitting guitars and screams.</p>
<p>The QR65 are very directional though. Sat in front of them at my computer, they sound absolutely stunning, particularly with Hi-Res music sources pumping through them. However, stepping away from the desk does make you realise that there isn’t quite the same bass response or room-filling audio that you find with speakers from Sonos, or smart-speakers from Apple or Amazon. You can, however, connect an external sub, and I feel that this completely rectifies the issue, but it’s a shame to need an additional accessory.</p>

<p>I think it’ll depend as well on the type of music you normally listen to. The QR65’s response sits much more in monitor category, and I feel that they’d be perfect for jazz, lo-fi beats and classical as well as being an excellent pick for music and audio editing. If you want room-filling rock, metal or drum and bass, you’ll likely want an external sub, or to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>That also stays true for gaming. These have proven to be excellent speakers for playing FPS titles, and the enhanced detail and precision of the audio made locating enemies easier. It also does a great job with more classically composed soundtracks like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but without an external sub you definitely lose out on the heft and drama of more bombastic titles like Doom: The Dark Ages. If aesthetics are your number one consideration, then there are few options that come close to the QR65, but in terms of gaming audio, they may not quite fit the bill depending on your preferred genre.</p>
