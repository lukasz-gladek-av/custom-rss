		<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Star Wars Zero Company</a> which is in development with BitReactor and Respawn on board. The initial reveal just told us that we would get more news this weekend, and that moment has arrived with the game’s first trailer along with the first details. What it confirms is that Star Wars Zero Company will be a turn based tactics game, looking a bit like XCOM, set during the final stages of The Clone Wars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows Hawks, a former Republic Officer, and his group known as Zero Company. All of the Zero Company members are essentially mercenaries for hire from across the galaxy, with each of them having their own skills. You have a droid that will be to able to hack systems, a Jedi that has Force abilities, a Mandalorian armed with all the gadgets, a Clone Trooper, and what looks like some kind of assassin. They are not the best of friends and will have their own differences to work out between themselves. We get a brief look of gameplay in the reveal trailer and that shows the turn based tactical element of Star Wars Zero Company, from positioning your characters to using their abilities in the most efficient way to take out enemies. When not in a fight, Hawks and Zero Company will set up a base of operations to gather intelligence from across the galaxy using informants who will point them to targets.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Star WarsZero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.”</p>
<p>“At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to&nbsp;Star Wars.”</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is set to released in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC. The game is available to wishlist now.</p>
