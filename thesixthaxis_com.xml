		<p>If you fancy taking a break from shooting alien scum in the face and would like something more relaxing for quite literally ten minutes then Short Trip may just be the thing for you.</p>
<p>It’s not a game as such and is described as an ‘interactive illustration’ which had been hand drawn of the course of five years. You get to control a cat tram through picturesque mountain villages, keeping to a schedule or going at your own pace. That’s it, a full play through will take less than ten minutes but I think it looks quite sweet.</p>

<p>Short Trip will launch on Steam on December 11th 2024.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Occasionally, you question whether a game is for you. Infinity Nikki, a cosy free-to-play open-world experience about wearing the most beautiful dresses, is on first impressions outside of my realms of expertise. However, whether it’s the stunning visuals, the beautiful and evocative fantasy world, or its joyful sense of fun and playfulness, Infinity Nikki dispenses with your preconceptions in moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki: Official Release Trailer - About Wishes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BUFYjUv72Yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, Infinity Nikki is a game about dressing up, but it plays a more integral part than you might think. While some are purely visual choices, other dresses provide special abilities, whether helping you to leap further with a double jump, or providing the ability to purify darkness-tainted monsters known as Esselings. Heck, there’s one for grooming animals where you sneak up on them, Assassin’s Creed style, and then lovingly give them a thorough brushing down. You learn everything you need to know about the game in the outrageously cute reactions that each of these animals will respond with, including the sassiest squirrel in the world.</p>


<p>Fundamentally, dresses and their accessories function as your skill tree and you’ll need to craft each element of an outfit to unlock its ability. You do this by collecting the necessary components and acquiring a sketch of said outfit to work from, with each also giving Nikki access to a new look, some of which will automatically appear when performing that action, while others you have to select manually when you’re ready for a spot of animal grooming.</p>


<p>Infinity Nikki immediately beds you into its fantasy world with a hefty dose of storytelling, and your first experience of the game sees you transported from your dusty old attic to the broken and evocative ruins of a long-forgotten realm. Ena the Curator has been imprisoned here for thousands of years, but with Nikki’s arrival, and indeed the arrival of her spectacular dress, fashioned from the Threads of Reunion, she’s set free.</p>
<p>It’s a short-lived escape though, and in her last act she grants you the Heart of Infinity, setting you on a path to save Miraland, while undoing all of the wonderful fashion-based powers you’ve only just discovered. Cue a quest – more accurately a series of quests, tasks and asides – to gain back your powers and refill your wardrobe while you attempt to save the realm.</p>
<p>You’re not alone in your adventure, accompanied by the incredibly cute, and actually amusing Momo. This little guy immediately sold the game to my 8-year-old son, and frankly, to me as well, his antics causing us to actually laugh out loud. Very few games manage that. He’s a helpful chap to have along for the ride too, pointing you towards items of interest, and even letting you take direct control for a spot of platforming.</p>
<p>Dada from the Stylists Guild is also along to help with your journey, and she gives you a Pear-Pal tablet to keep you organised, setting you on course to become a Stylist. From here you can check out your wardrobe, Sketches and quests, as well as take Courses, which are milestones or achievements which in turn unlock further rewards.</p>

<p>Your sense of fashion isn’t all about those special abilities, and sometimes you just have to look your absolute best. Styling Challenges see you face off against other Stylists, battling them for fashion supremacy by choosing the most visually powerful outfit. Each challenge is given a theme such as Sweet, Elegant or Cool, and it’s up to you to pick the right look to win the day. Mixing and matching doesn’t always make you an immediate fasionista, but it remains consistently satisfying to win the day.</p>
<p>What might surprise you the most about Inifinty Nikki, is how much of a fully-fledged RPG it is. I know we’re past the point where mobile and free-to-play titles can match or even better their full-price rivals, but Infinity Nikki manages to reel you in from the very start. There’s a keen sense of style to everything here, from the beautiful vistas to the stunningly detailed clothing, and its open world is simply enjoyable to explore. I haven’t meandered quite so readily since playing Breath of the Wild and, if anything, Infinity Nikki offers you more to do.</p>
<p>Platforming plays a major part in your adventure, and thanks to Nikki’s dress-given abilities, you can climb incredibly high in a short space of time, While you do, you’re looking for Whimstars, essential for making progress, as well as the different crafting materials that abound in the overworld. Alongside that, you come across side quests and minigames, each of which will reward you with experience and money to fund your soon-to-be-problematic shopping sprees.</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of the Gacha genre, of course, and if you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> or any of its peers you’ll know what to expect. Different rewards for a huge spectrum of achievements will constantly pop, and each section of your Pear Pal will regularly sport a red notification, drawing you in for a little spot of euphoric back-patting.</p>

<p>These are the precursor to the monetisation for Infinity Nikki, where the team at Infold Games will be hoping you need that particularly spectacular skirt so much that you’re willing to put down real money for it, rather than embarking on an entirely free, but incredibly time-consuming grind. You can play quite happily without spending money, and I haven’t felt the need to put anything in thus far, but there’s the clawing idea that I will at some point. The most impressive, or stylistically powerful, additions to Nikki’s wardrobe look so much easier to get with real-world money.</p>
<p>You could argue that that’s only fair for a game that I’ve already plunged several hours into and which is genuinely good, easily eclipsing some of Square Enix’ most recent action-RPGs, but there’s still that feeling that you should be spending your money on something with more substance. I’d forget that for now. Overall, it’s not surprising to see Infinity Nikki take a similar route to MiHoYo’s offerings, but you can decide to ignore it, up to a point, and I genuinely don’t think you’ll regret your time spent here.</p>
<p>There have been a few technical hiccups in the pre-launch build we played, particularly through the tutorials, with occasional messages about an unstable network which we’re hoping will be ironed out at launch. Given the number of people waiting for that launch, you’ve got to hope that Infold Games have got as many servers dialled up as humanly possible. It’s also worth noting that your progress is saved to one specific server, so make sure you select the right one when booting the game, unless you want to start again from the beginning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Project Mugen is now Ananta – see the new trailer for the anime ‘urban open world’ game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/project-mugen-is-now-ananta-see-the-new-trailer-for-the-anime-urban-open-world-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/project-mugen-is-now-ananta-see-the-new-trailer-for-the-anime-urban-open-world-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ananta has been revealed as the new name for Project Mugen by Naked Rain and NetEase, their upcoming ‘urban open world’ game that looks to take on the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> with a wild mishmash of gaming inspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>Ananta is in development for PC, mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>. Pre-registration is now available with the first tests coming in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="ANANTA | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KeN9CeJQi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s see, I can spot plenty of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 announce trailer</a> through the first half of the video, but it quickly becomes clear that this isn’t just an anime GTA-like when someone breathes an ice cream into existence, and a chainsaw car monster goes rampaging down a motorway. Also the bipedal toilet race…</p>
<p>Later in the trailer we get glimpses of gameplay inspired by Insomniac’s Spider-Man games, with grapple swinging through the city and stealthy superhero game action with environmental takedowns. That’s alongside the more standard action RPG combat with some over the top cutscene abilities. But there’s also plenty more of the open world GTA-like stuff with politely asking drivers to get out of their car for you and driving round the city, gun battles in a car chase, more standard car races, shooting hoops, weight lifting, darts, and more.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild mash of ideas, at times. So long as you can live with free-to-play gacha monetisation as seen in Genshin and ZZZ, this could be right up your street.</p>
<p>As for what’s actually going on in the world? Here’s some blurb from <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">Naked Rain</a>:</p>
<p>Welcome to Nova, the sun-soaked coastal hub that’s perfect for ditching winter!</p>
<p>This city is electric—whether you’re street surfing in Paradox Plaza or pulling marathon gaming sessions at Glimmergold, there’s never a dull moment. And with humans and Chaos living side by side, you never know what crazy twists your adventure might take!</p>
<p>Nova Tourism Board Pro Tip: Run into Chaos gone wild? Report it first, snap selfies later! Have a blast, but stay safe!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Holidays are supposed to be relaxing, but that definitely hasn’t been the case for Alex, the protagonist of Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. Between being caught in a storm, shipwrecked and washed up on a mysterious island, she’s also found herself in the company of some distinctly idiosyncratic people. Not only are they named after the Grecian gods, they’re all suffering from an unhelpful bout of amnesia, which, for someone who just wants to go home, is downright infuriating.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01kdNoJKfgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still, Alex has the kind of can-do attitude that many game protagonists have, and instead of sitting about in the doldrums, she sets about exploring the island, discovering what makes the inhabitants tick, and hopefully figuring out a way to get herself back home.</p>


<p>The interesting thing is, the inhabitants of Ambrosia Island actually are the Greek gods of myth, they’re just not quite as you’d remember them. Polygon Treehouse present to us their take on the gods, which is to say, they’ve been modernised and reimagined, opening up questions about the nature of godhood, of the passage of time, and of character through the lens of modernity. That sounds overtly serious, and Mythwrecked isn’t a ‘serious’ game, but it is one with charm, gentleness and compassion – a perfect antidote to this season’s crop of calamitous blockbusters.</p>


<p>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is the epitome of a chilled, cosy experience, and it’s easy to fall into the routine of searching the island, discovering new residents and helping them with their missing memories. Unlocking a memory has to be one of the game’s highlights, combining some joyous animation with further information and introspection from that character. Your first companion is Hermes, the messenger of the gods, but he’s lost his sandals and his satchel, relying on you to return them to him.</p>
<p>This is where you get to utilise the height of Grecian technology: the Ambrosidex. While there’s no Pokémon here, you are attempting to catch all the gods’ memories, and there’s a map, an inventory, and further lore for you to dig into within your device. Crammed in alongside, it also functions as a radar, bleeping away when you’re coming closer to a god’s lost items. With Alex’s quest to get home, and her commitment to helping the island’s residents, it is basically essential and helps to keep everything organised while you explore.</p>
<p>Hermes isn’t just good for spilling a few memories out of his winged mouth, he also helps you to fast travel around the island via Portal Doors, which you can unlock by swapping Ambrosia fruit for the corresponding key. Given that you’ll be collecting these fruit without even thinking, it’s a fair trade. He’s not the only one who’s after some fruit though, so you might want to balance out who you’re giving them to, at least to begin with.</p>
<p>Every one of the gods here is suffering from amnesia, and to build their trust in you, they each set you a task. These tasks in turn bring life back to the island, resurrecting the landscape and returning it to its former glory, while strengthening the corresponding god, and your relationship with them. Gods are always after offerings, and it just so happens that Alex is a kind and helpful soul who’s willing to do the legwork for them.</p>

<p>You soon settle into the rhythm of discovery and exploration, and though there are few actual puzzles, the island itself is one huge conundrum. There are myriad interlocking parts that you have to put together in a certain order to progress, and it’s a gentle gameplay loop that easily whisks away the hours.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that Ambrosia Island isn’t without its mild frustrations. Just like a real-life visit to a foreign place, you often have little idea where you’re going, and you’ll meander back and forth across the increasingly expansive island in search of various landmarks that you just know you’ve seen fifteen minutes before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a map, and hopping in and out of it will point you in the right direction, though it won’t provide you with all the answers as to how to get there, and where precisely the thing is you’re looking for.</p>
<p>The soundtrack reflects the laid-back vibes, with your exploration set to plaintive acoustic guitar and the constant sound of waves crashing against the beach. There’s much more to experience here as well, with unlockable cassettes lying around the place, each with their own ditties, and there’s a ridiculous number of opportunities to sit and listen wherever there’s a tape deck and some comfortable cushions. In many ways, this is the heart of Mythwrecked, ensuring that you take your time, ease into it, and consider exactly why you’re here.</p>
<p>While Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island runs smoothly throughout, the audio levels are occasionally off-kilter – seriously, these are some <em>LOUD</em> sound effects, and the transitions between different areas can result in a less than enjoyable audio hiccup. There’s the option to turn different elements of the audio down though, which solves many of the issues, and hopefully these rough edges can be rounded off with a patch or two.</p>
