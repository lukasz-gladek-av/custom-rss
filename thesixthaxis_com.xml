			<p>Every holiday growing up, we’d head off to our caravan. I spent each day embroiled in outdoor activities like riding my bike, climbing trees and skateboarding exceptionally badly, and I loved every single second of being there. When all that fresh air wore thin, the other thing I loved was the arcade. This wasn’t a huge arcade, it was a room in the central caravan site centre, with three or four arcade machines and an air hockey table that never worked. Still, this was my haven, and my first experience of classic games like Rainbow Islands and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs. There are formative moments in your life, and this place played a huge role in my love for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Snow Bros. Wonderland - Launch Trailer - PS4 | PS5 | Nintendo Switch | Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfOEWzJbNQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Snow Bros. was a major part of that. An absolute favourite amongst those machines, it was a riff on the original Super Mario Bros. game, giving you a single-screen platform arena that saw you coating enemies in snow before booting them across the screen, taking out any enemies stupid enough to get in the way, plastering them all over the place. It was the right side of chaotic, and visually appealing, and my supply of 20 pence pieces would clink satisfyingly into the beckoning coin slot until my pockets were empty.</p>


<p>This is all to say, I was astounded and eternally happy to discover that the Snow Bros. would be returning. Snow Bros. Wonderland is a sequel to the original two games, following on from their storyline, with the children of the original Snow Bros. taking up the mantle to save the kingdom from the evil King Atchich. It shifts from the 2D perspective to an isometric 3D one, but the overarching gameplay remains the same: cover the badguys in snow, and then yeet them around the screen. As a starting point, it’s a great one.</p>


<p>The team at Tatsujin, under the watchful eye of original developers Toaplan, have captured plenty of the charm of the original, though I preferred the slightly chubbier build of the original Snow Bros. to that of their slender sons. The enemies have made the jump to 3D as well, and though it’s not as immediately arresting as the original, it’s a fine attempt. The game is broken up into different worlds, with the landscape and enemies changing as you advance, each one headed by a massive enemy boss, each of which are simple, but visually appealing.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises is the challenge that you can face in Snow Bros. Wonderland – its cheery visual style belies some tough moments, particularly against the bosses. That said, it’s just the right side of challenging, and there’s plenty of reward for seeing off the final enemy or firing the last snowball into a particularly annoying enemy.</p>
<p>You’re aiming for the highest score as possible as these are then converted into a currency you can use to upgrade your Snow Bros. abilities and their visual look. I loved being able to deck them out in cute hats and boots, and they really become yours, while the slow and somewhat puny feeling attacks they have at the start soon advance into powerful and uproarious abilities later on.</p>

<p>You’ll need them too. My favourite moments were where you have to survive against a steady stream of enemies for a set amount of time, and the game pours it on here, dropping wave after wave into your area. This, in turn, lets you ride a giant snowball through a ton of enemies, resulting in a deeply satisfying combo. You can multiply that enjoyment by playing in four-player co-op too, as there’s plenty of amusement to be had yeeting snowballs at each other on the way to clearing an area.</p>
<p>The only yellow mark in the snow is that the Nintendo Switch version of the game has a poor frame rate when docked. It’s not aggressively bad, with inconsistent dips, but you’ll notice it the moment you start playing. It’s still playable, but it makes the game feel hastily put together when that isn’t the case. Things improve greatly when you play in handheld mode, and everything becomes brighter and more vibrant here, rather than the washed-out look it has when blown up on a TV, and I happily played here for many hours through the campaign.</p>

		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO - Everything You Need To Know" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jH5hZqNirVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>
