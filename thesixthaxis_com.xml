<p>In our ARC Raiders article, Stefan pondered whether the game could be for everyone, and said, <em>“ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.”</em></p>

		<p>Dead By Daylight’s 2v8 mode is back for a limited time and it will feature two iconic franchises. The Silent Hill x Castlevania crossover will see Pyramid Head and Dracula team up to hunt down the survivors. As mentioned this is going to be a limited time run, starting today and ending on November 20th. You can see the character designs in the trailer below.</p>

<p>This is the fifth time the 2v8 mode has been added to Dead By Daylight, with previous entries featuring characters from the likes of Resident Evil, Scream’s Ghost Face, and The Oni. Dead By Daylight is still one of Behaviour Interactive’s main focuses having cancelled Project T last year, but the team is also working on publishing Blight: Survival, which is being developed by Haenir Studio. Blight: Survival is a PvE survival game set in the medieval era where players face off against monsters and men. A small teaser for that was released last week.</p>

		<p>Kiborg developer Sobaka Studios is switching genres with its next game, moving from a roguelite beat ’em up to a party game that stars chickens. Chicken Chicken will see up to eight players compete against each other online in a variety of challenges to come out on top. A demo is being released today on Steam and Epic Game Store, which will have three of the events players will face off against each other in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chiken Chiken - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ9yOX1mDi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We come from a background of dark, violent action games like&nbsp;KIBORG, so&nbsp;Chicken Chicken&nbsp;might seem a bit unusual,”</em> said Dmitry Kachkov, Head of Sobaka Studio. <em>“But when you feel the pain of reaching the top of the mountain in Climbing Up…and someone hits you with a rocket launcher and sends you all the way to the bottom, you will understand.”</em></p>
<p>The list of the events available in the Chicken Chicken demo are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cars – players will race against each other to collect seed bags and deliver them to a giant chicken at the top of a mountain.</li>
<li>Climbing Up – players are tasked with climbing up a mountain made of old buildings while evading cannons dotted around the map, and rockets from the launchers other players can pick up.</li>
<li>Swamp – the one team game in this demo where two teams are tethered to a giant chicken and attempt to catch flies. Breaking the tether or falling into the swamp are two issues that need to be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chicken Chicken is due to release in 2026. In our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/">Kiborg</a>, Adrian wrote, <em>“Too much of my time with Kiborg was spent thinking how much more fun I’d be having if the game dumped the roguelite elements and just went full old-school third person action brawler. So many of its failings could be ignored in that form. Instead, Kiborg is a slightly underwhelming rougelite that looks like it should be far more fun that it is.”</em></p>
