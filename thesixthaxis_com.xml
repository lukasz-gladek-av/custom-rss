<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/24/tales-of-berseria-review/">Tales of Berseria Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tales of Berseria review, Miguel said, <em>“Tales of Berseria feels like a Tales game made just for me. There’s so many games in the series now, and I’ll never play them all, but the characters and the narrative and the combat mechanics of Berseria just click with all of my tastes so well. For some, the lack of gameplay innovation might be a turn off, but for me, a classic Tales gameplay system combined with a unique narrative led to a fantastic experience. Fans both new and old would be doing a disservice to themselves if they didn’t check this game out.”</em></p>

		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that a free update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will release next week, adding a New Game Plus mode, new trophies, new cosmetics and more. The patch will launch on 24th November</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - New Game+ | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Game Plus will be playable once you’ve beaten the main game, and it does exactly what you’d expect. You get to start the game over and start off with all the skills and weapons from your first playthrough. So you’ll have a gun right from the start.</p>
<p>Of course, the point is that you’re then playing the game on a higher difficulty, and this adds two new Trophies</p>
<p>A new currency is also being added –&nbsp;Ghost Flowers –&nbsp;which can be exchanged for 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. There is also an additional tier of upgrades for existing armour sets and weapons.</p>

<p>For the game generally, the patch will let you replay content in the post-game after finishing the main story, and there’s a new stats display for this. New button mapping is available in accessibility settings, and new Photo Mode features like shutter speed and a composition grid.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly typical post-launch update that we often see for big budget games, but there’s more exciting stuff coming in 2026, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-is-coming-in-2026-as-a-free-update/">the multiplayer Legends mode has been promised</a> for then –&nbsp;again as a free update.</p>
<p>Aran was full of praise for&nbsp;Ghost of Yōtei in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">our review,</a> saying it “is an excellent game with an engrossing story, a great lead, deep combat and a land that has so much to discover with a lot of details. This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.”</p>
