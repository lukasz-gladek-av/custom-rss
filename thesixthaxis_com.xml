			<p>There’s been many times where I’ve uttered the words “this is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.” It happened when I first played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a> as I rode a horse across empty plains, unbothered by enemies as I approached a giant, moving, climbing puzzle. It happened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/10/superliminal-review-ps4-xbox-switch/">Superliminal</a> twisted my mind into confusing shapes as I tried to understand its perspective-based puzzles. It even happened when I saw a trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/17/genital-jousting-is-a-wonderfully-silly-looking-game-and-a-bit-nsfw/">Genital Jousting</a>. Now it’s happened for possible the final time. Why? Because Blippo+ is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blippo+ | Switch and Steam Release Date Trailer | Coming Sept 23rd" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f69DgOfBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technically speaking, Blippo+ isn’t even a traditional game. It’s more of a 90s television simulator… now in colour! There’s no on-demand streaming here, it’s a programme guide complete with multiple TV channels to switch between. After the original “1-bit” release in black and white on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playdate/">Playdate</a>, this PC and Switch version now brings more of an analogue TV aesthetic, right down to the artifacting and fuzzy video quality. And I do mean video quality, as it’s live action video of actual actors doing actual acting, but it’s all unerringly presented in the style of television from three decades ago. It’s actually incredibly impressive how perfectly they’ve nailed this aesthetic – using Blippo+ is basically indistinguishable from actual television back then, right down to scanning for channels.</p>


<p>Well, almost. You won’t find reruns of Friends, Fresh Prince or Star Trek Voyager here, because this is television from another planet, called Planet Blip. This is explained through the TV shows themselves, with one news segment explaining that a planet somewhere off in space seems to have activated devices called PeeDees that can receive the television signal from Planet Blip due to a fold in space. A PeeDee is apparently a smartphone-type device that is ubiquitous on Blip. It took a moment for me to realise that the planet they were referring to was Earth, and that my/our playing of this game is a part of its story. I am not sure if I mentioned this yet, but Blippo+ is weird.</p>


<p>Planet Blip seems to be caught in some kind of sci-fi 90s fashion vortex, with everyone having era appropriate clothing, makeup, and hairstyles… if they were appearing in Doctor Who. The TV shows are, if anything, weirder than you’re expecting. One show is a cooking show that shows you how to prepare alien fruit, complete with a cooking show voiceover explaining what to do and some good alien fruit props. Another is a scientist who can revive people from their DNA and is using it to conduct interviews that are a bit insulting, but very unsympathetic to the horrors of suddenly being revived long after your own death. Bushwalker is a first person view of walking through the great outdoors, with two hands holding a knife and a wooden axe moving at the sides of the screen. Then there’s Tantric Computing, which is on the “porn” channel which is all scrambled, but images keep making it through of a keyboard being softly stroked, a cable being inserted, or a (computer) mouse being handled whilst soft moans play in the background.</p>
<p>It’s just about the most surreal thing I’ve ever experienced. Hundreds of people worked on this – writers, actors, graphic designers, musicians, editors – and it’s a stunningly odd achievement. I do believe they’ve nailed what they wanted to do, from the aesthetic, to the vaguely self aware nature of the performances, the creativity on show, it all seems pretty much perfect for the niche I have to assume this is aimed at: drama kids, weirdos like me that watch too much Dropout TV, and fans of shows with rich veins of overly meta humour.</p>

<p>The problem is, I imagine for a general audience it all kind of blends together after a while. It’s pretty hit and miss at the best of times, but the constant stream of irreverent weirdness means it lacks the variety to keep me actually engaged. If some channels did things that took themselves seriously, others did comedy stuff, other did chat shows, there would be stuff to switch between. Back when linear TV was still the norm in my life, I wouldn’t channel surf to find things of the exact same tone as what I was already watching, I’d be looking for something different. That’s the whole point of changing the channel. Here you just hop from weird to weird, so the novelty of that runs out far too quickly. If some of the programming took itself more seriously, at least in the way that something like Tommy Wiseau’s The Room does, then the variety would go a long way.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, the programmes themselves are all very short as well, perhaps up to a minute long. This makes sense, but it also limits their depth and impact – they’re over so quickly that they become transient, there’s no ads or pauses between them to leave a moment to sit with the end of a show and react to it. Of course, the constant barrage of advertisements are a scourge on humanity, but at least in the olden days when the younger generations still watched live TV they did provide a pause to reflect on what you’ve just seen, react to it, discuss it, or at least go to make a cup of tea.</p>

			<p>EA heard all our complaints about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. I and many others lamented that last year’s game was far too similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and was lacking major changes, and it certainly feels like EA took note of this. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>, then, comes with some changes that do make it play differently to the previous FC games, though a lot of familiarity (and poor defending) remains.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Official Launch Trailer | The Club is Yours" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2Q4xrASt94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The big change in FC 26 is the addition of Authentic and Competitive gameplay styles, split between the single player and multiplayer sides of the game. Authentic mode is designed to recreate the proper action on the pitch, getting closer to what you would see in a real life match, making things a bit slower and more focused on tactical play rather than sprinting to goal and shooting. That’s the competitive mode and is for online play so matches move quickly and players can go end-to-end while chasting scoring opportunities.</p>


<p>If you are going to play the single player modes, I’d recommend at least playing on World Class difficulty for a real world and authentic feel. Teams act a bit more like their real life counterparts adhering to their tactical shapes and instructions. At Professional difficulty and below, it is too &nbsp;easy to break through opposition defences and have scorelines getting near double digits, which does get boring after a while. It is a continuing issue through the franchise where defending play is just non-existent outside of the higher difficulties, and it is something that I would hope would be looked at. Beating Fulham 9-0 and then Brentford 8-1 a week later as Chelsea on Professional difficulty should just not be happening.</p>


<p>Manager Career and Player Career will remain the two go-to options for single player. Like the previous entry you can choose a real manager or player to play as or create your own – shoutout to Mehdi Leris of Pisa who was the real life player I chose after picking a team at random team. While there is not much difference as a player, EA has tried to refresh the managerial side with unexpected events that can impact the team and individual players. These can range from the coach getting to the ground late so your players don’t have much time to warm up, impacting their sharpness, and can go to the extreme of players getting career ending injuries leading them to retire. You never know when an unexpected event will happen – it’s kind of in the name – which does make career mode a bit more unpredictable.</p>
<p>The youth team is once again an integral part of career, where you can play as them in tournaments and create development plans. There is quite a bit of depth to objectives and player development, but do not expect something on par with Football Manager. You can also pick Live points to start the seasons with, with real life results from the season so far added in already.</p>

<p>Outside of Career is Ultimate Team, Squad Battles, Rush, Clubs and regular online matches for those who want to face off against the world. It is in these online matches where you will be playing with the faster paced Competitive setting. There have been some changes to Ultimate team with the addition of Live events, allowing players to face off against each in varied match settings. There is also the new tournament and gauntlet feature, with tournaments running at different points of the season instead of every week. In Gauntlet, you play a run of five matches but in each successive match you need to swap your players around, essentially giving them every player in your club a run out. It is probably best to save those gold players for the latter stages.</p>

<p>Another new thing is the ability to now evolve goalkeepers, which was oddly missing from FC 25. Your online enjoyment obviously depends on the rest of the player base, but in Ultimate Team there are already squads consisting of the best players where people have invested to get them, though there are challenges that will only allow you to use certain ranked players to get people to play with more varied squads.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		EA Sports FC 26 is a better game than FC 25 and can give you a good game of football, especially when Authentic mode in single player comes together properly. However, for that to happen you need to play on World Class difficulty, as anything below that exposes poor defending by the AI. There has been evolution here, but FC 26 is still only a step towards getting the balance right, and not the final stop.	</p></div>
