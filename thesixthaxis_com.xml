		<p>The Ukraine-based developers behind the acclaimed Metro series have announced La Quimera, a brand new sci-fi shooter set in a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>La Quimera (which translates to The Chimera in English) takes players to a Latin American megalopolis with a lush jungle setting, casting you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, those robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go it alone, with La Quimera featuring support for up to 3-player co-op through the story.</p>
<p>From the trailer and imagery released today, there’s a great look to this game, both on a technical level, and stylistically. There’s a classic Killzone vibe to seeing enemy soldiers with the glowing eyes on their armoured masks.</p>

<p>“Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>
<p>La Quimera is coming from Reburn, the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, while the 4A Games brand, 4A Games Malta studios and the Metro series all remain with Embracer Group and its publishing label Plaion. Reburn is a team of over 110 developers that previously worked on that Metro series, with a wealth of experience going back through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>, Metro: Last Light and Metro 2033, and even back to the founders working on the original STALKER. La Quimera’s development is being led by Sasha Kostiuk, who served as gameplay and AI designer on Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light.</p>
<p>While the setting will be completely different, let’s look back at this team’s most recent work. Metro Exodus released in 2019, taking the post-apocalyptic tale out on the tracks to head across Siberia. Nicole scored it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">an excellent 9/10</a>, saying, “Metro Exodus provides an immersive FPS experience that marks a new milestone for the franchise. Its survival-horror, sandbox and shooter elements are remarkably well balanced, constituting an engaging and thrilling game that’ll leave you no stranger to a good jump scare. The once linear horror franchise has been reformed, introducing expansive environments to indulge in without derailing the narrative. Metro Exodus is a must play.”</p>
