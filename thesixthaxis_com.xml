		<p>Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury have announced that their rather unique architectural puzzler Blue Prince will also be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S console in Spring 2025, alongside the previously announced PC version of the game.</p>
<p>Blue Prince – say it out loud if you’ve not spotted the pun just yet – will also be available on day one through both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Extra and Premium, and through<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">&nbsp;Game Pass</a> day one tiers.</p>

<p>Blue Prince – say it out loud if you’ve not spotted the pun just yet – presents you with a 5×9 grid to fill with unique room tiles, constructing a mansion with a quest to find room 46. However, you only have certain tiles available to you, and the rooms you have in your hand might inevitably lead you to a dead end with no other tiles or doorways to pass through.</p>
<p>As your run and day ends, the mysterious mansion rearranges itself, wiping away the layout of the previous attempt and tasking you with constructing the manor on Mount Holly from scratch, seeking to uncover its secrets.</p>

<p>Last night’s announcement adds to the already-announced PC version of the game, and there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">a demo on Steam</a> that PC gamers can try out, if you’re already curious.</p>

		<p>MindsEye was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">revealed during last night’s State of Play broadcast</a> and was one of the most impressive titles on the show with bombastic action and some rather sublime lighting. If you missed the trailer, check it out below and pay close attention to the names and logos found in the last few seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Reveal Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHoIAnnV9LI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is being created by Build A Rocket Boy, the team who are working on <a href="https://everywhere.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, a place where you can create games and worlds without knowing how to code. You may not have noticed the Everywhere logo and text at the bottom of the trailers for MindsEye, but we did and had questions, so reached out to the publishers, IOI Partners, to ask them exactly what that means.</p>
<p>They are keeping things very close to their chest at this time, and would not answer any specific questions but did say “MindsEye will release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and EVERYWHERE, Build A Rocket Boy’s’ immersive entertainment platform.”</p>
<p>So that confirms MindsEye will be running in Everywhere which, depending on how the game has been constructed, could mean that a version of Everywhere is up and running on consoles – it’s presently only available on PC – or that the platform is modular enough that it can produce a standalone version of Mindseye for consoles. It would be quite mad to create multiple separate versions of the game.</p>

<p>Further to this, Everywhere allows you to “reuse and remix the creations from others”, so does that mean that you will be able to rip MindsEye apart and create your own version of the game? PC games have had modding since the very beginning, but allowing people to completely remix a game and use the assets is practically unheard of.</p>

<p>We await further announcements from IOI Partners and Build A Rocket Boy with interest!</p>
