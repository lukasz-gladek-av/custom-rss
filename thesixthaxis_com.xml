		<p>Atlus has released an update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops.</p>


<p>Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up.</p>
<p>This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now.</p>
<p>Here’s the brief patch notes for&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</li>
<li>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</li>
</ul>
<p>In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.”</p>
