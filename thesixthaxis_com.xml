			<p>The Metal Slug series would have been low on my list as a candidate for a tactics game. Better known for bombastic 2D run ‘n’ gun shooting, it’s the antithesis of a slower, more thoughtful tactics games. Like its iconic pixellated tanks though, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is ready to blow those expectations to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZlvf_m8Zc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>General Donald Morden is the returning big bad, and having escaped justice – as bad men always seem to do – he’s declared martial law in Sirocco City. This is A. Bad. Thing. and you are part of the ragtag team sent in to stop him.</p>


<p>There’s plenty of early familiarity to the way that Metal Slug Tactics works. An isometric view is broken down into a grid, and you move your units about the map as far as their movement allows, before then using whatever offensive technique is available to you.</p>
<p>Leikir Studios haven’t sat on their pixelated laurels though, and while publisher Dotemu is behind stellar upgrades and reimaginings like Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap and Streets of Rage 4, it’s nice to see that they’ve taken a fresh approach to the tactics genre. The further your unit moves, the more Dodge resources they generate, and that stat reduces how much damage your character takes. Combined with using cover to further protect you, you can effectively charge through the enemies’ defences and unleash devastation. This makes it feel like Metal Slug.</p>


<p>Your special abilities further enhance that feel. These are powered by Adrenaline, another resource you gain with longer movement, via jumps, or through certain passive abilities and actions. You can save these abilities up to cause massive damage, calling in airstrikes or amping up your unit’s weaponry, and they’re critical to success against some of the larger tanks and enemy units you come up against.</p>
<p>The last key to the tactical puzzle is syncing up your attacks, positioning your team so that they’ll all join in with their own additional attacks, whittling down the enemies’ health bars as they do. In other series, this might feel optional, but here it’s downright essential, particularly at the start of each run before you’ve had a chance to buff your team.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Metal Slug Tactics all starts to make sense. Leikir have translated the run ‘n’ gun ethos of the original into a tactics game with startling clarity, without overcomplicating things, and it’s somehow balanced the outlook of the series and its new form. As a long-time fan of Metal Slug, who also happens to love games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, it’s a perfect mix.</p>

<p>It helps that it looks so pretty. The isometric viewpoint leans into the original’s pixel-art design, and everything feels authentic to the series. That’s before the hi-res artwork appears, lifting the UI, character conversations and special abilities so that it feels unequivocally modern.</p>
<p>That modernity then stretches into the game’s progression system, lifting roguelike elements so that you start a new run each time, gaining experience to level up your characters and their abilities as you advance. You choose your route across each stage, the map offering different rewards in each area. Again, it makes perfect sense with Metal Slug’s arcade roots, and it retains the addictive one-more-go design that would have ensured you kept ploughing money into the slot.</p>
<p>It definitely doesn’t go easy on you, and there’s that early punishment you’d expect from a Roguelike, but once you’ve got a handle on what it expects of you, and you’ve started to level up your team, things start to become easier for you.</p>

<p>Fans of 90s arcade games will love the sound design as well, which is thoroughly old-school. Between the energetic electronic soundtrack and the digitised voice work, Metal Slug Tactics sounds like you could be in the 90s, and it’s utterly brilliant, at least if you’re old enough to be played by the nostalgia card.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I love what Dotemu and Leikir Studios have achieved with Metal Slug Tactics. The unlikeliest pivot for a franchise aside, it mixes interesting tactical action, Roguelike progression and brilliant visuals into an indie title that nails the balance between nostalgia and modernity.	</p></div>

			<p>I don’t think it’s especially controversial to say that Dragon Age: Inquisition sort of sucked. Well, it wasn’t bad – it did win a bunch of Game of the Year awards – but it certainly fell short of the first two games, and the open-world take on the game ended up being a painful slog of side-quests and wasted time. It wasn’t bad, but I never felt like it did the series justice. I’m pretty happy, then, that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a far more focused affair, with a generally faster pace, and open zones rather than full open-world gameplay. It’s so much better, and while it’s not perfect, it does feel like a return to form for the series and for Bioware as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things kick off really fast, with you being introduced to Rook, your character, as they’re going into a bar to try and meet one of their companions. Things don’t quite go according to plan, and you soon find yourself instead teaming up with the familiar old face of Varric. Not that this really improves matters as things continue to go south, one thing leading to another, some ancient Elven gods getting released, and it now being your job to try and un-release them. Classic RPG stuff, really.</p>


<p>The trials and tribulations that you’ll have to navigate on The Veilguard’s overarching quest will often have you battling your way through demons and blightspawn. So it’s a pretty good thing that the combat is an absolute blast, letting you easily switch between two weapons, regardless of the class that you settle on. As a mage, that meant switching between a magical staff, and an orb and dagger combo that let me cause miniature explosions.</p>


<p>Levelling up naturally gains your character new abilities, and you can easily respec within your class if you want to try out a different build, which is nice, though you’re locked into your overall class from the beginning. You don’t get to test the classes out before deciding what to be, just watch a video showing what they can do. Would it kill big old RPGs to allow us to test the classes for a bit? At the very least, there’s only three fighting classes – rogue, mage or warrior – and they’re broad enough that you should know what you want to be.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not going to go alone – that’d be dangerous, wouldn’t it? Two companion characters can go into battle with you. Dragon Age has changed a lot since the original game, and with the more action-heavy combat, BioWare has scaled back the control you have over the rest of the party, now more about ordering and using their abilities to the fullest. It’s a simple system to use through the ability wheel and feels incredibly smooth, allowing you to feel like you’re half-controlling your whole crew.</p>
<p>While we’re talking companions, gosh, it’s a good group. The mix of characters here is very good, and you’re bound to find a couple of characters you like spending time with, and writing and performances that you’ll enjoy. I was a big fan of Neve, mostly, and her general “Sherlock Holmes but fantasy” vibe was incredibly cool to play along with. This helped a lot as, during the character creation process, I chose to be from the Shadow Dragon faction, which Neve and I had in common. I do feel as though I preferred the options in Dragon Age 2 overall, mostly because of Isabela, but it’s still a good bunch to mesh with this time around.</p>

<p>And the writing is mostly good throughout the game… mostly. It lacks the same backwards-facing decisions as the original trilogy, which is something of a shame, and the way that your decisions in The Veilguard impact the world and your team tends to be a lot more immediate. It’s more immediate that way, letting you know what’s going down straight away, but is another shift for the series.</p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment, though, there’s a weird, uncanny feeling that permeates a lot of the general chatter between characters. It feels like Iron Man or Loki could pop out at any given moment; it’s all just a bit Marvel. There are quips, and a vibe that just doesn’t quite mesh with the high fantasy feel, and which feels rooted in scriptwriting trends that felt played-out half a decade ago. That’s my main gripe though – and specifically with Bellara, who was the biggest offender on this front – and plenty of you will enjoy having that style of conversation sprinkled throughout.</p>
