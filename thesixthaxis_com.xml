		<p>LilliLandia Games, which is a Tencent Studio, has announced a new fantasy simulation game called Animula Nook. It is being billed as a lilliput game and for those who are not sure what that means, lilliput comes from Jonathan Swift’s Guilliver’s Travels. Lilliput is the island where the six inch tall Lilliputlians live, and that should give you a clue of what to expect in Animula Nook.</p>

<p>In Animula Nook, what is normal sized to us tower above the characters that live in this world. House plants are towering trees and forgotten little things like buttons can be major resources. This is essentially The Borrowers the videogame. The key features have been detailed by LilliLandia Games, and you can read the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Discover a tiny yet immense world:&nbsp;Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect beyond the ordinary:&nbsp;In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Build with everyday objects:&nbsp;Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Befriend the world’s tiny folk:&nbsp;This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Define yourself in every detail:&nbsp;Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Convenient creative tools:&nbsp;Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Animula Nook has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Mac.</p>
