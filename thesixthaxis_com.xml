		<p>Unfrozen has released a brand new gameplay trailer for the turn based title Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, which is the official prequel to the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games. Originally, the studio was working solely with Ubisoft to develop the game, but yesterday that changed when Unfrozen announced that publisher Hooded Horse has come on board as a publishing partner for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. Ubisoft remains the IP holder for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Gameplay Trailer | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlVlN7NXF00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First, let’s start with the gameplay trailer for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. As the game is a prequel to the main series it will have story beats and events that have been referenced in other games, as well as have its own stories. In the gameplay trailer, you can see that the combat will remain turn based and take place across vibrant and varying biomes on the continent of Jadame. As the player you will have the option to choose which faction to play as, and make choices that impact the entire continent. The playable factions include Temple (Classic Humans), Necropolis (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Underground Creatures and Dark Elves), and Hive (Demonic Insectoids). Unfrozen has stated that there is another faction that is yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era will have a campaign that can be played solo, as well as classic, one hero, and arena modes. In classic mode, players choose their heroes, upgrade their castle and explore the map. One hero mode is a blitz mode with only one hero so when they fall it is all over. Arena mode is all about jumping straight into battle with different enemies. There will also be an in-game editor where players can create and share scenarios. The game is going to be released into Early Access first via Steam, and you can request access for playtests on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era Steam</a> page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Krafton has announced a major leadership shake up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/unknown-worlds">Unknown Worlds</a>, with co-founders Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire leaving the studio “effectively immediately”, being replaced by new CEO Steve Papoutsis, who’s coming over from Callisto Protocol team Striking Distance Studios.</p>
<p>This is a very significant change, with the Subnautica 2 early access release still aiming for later this year, and is a major cause for concern amongst the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica">Subnautica</a> community.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> publisher Krafton is keep to express that while they “sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.” So why has this happened?</p>
<p>Through the press release, there’s an expectation that Papoutsis will being “renewed energy and momentum to delivering the long-anticipated Subnautica 2 experience to fans.” While Krafton CEO CH Kim says that “Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The statement goes on to discuss Krafton’s oversight putting regular milestones and progress assessments in place for all its studios, and that “Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process.”</p>

<p>So, it doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that Subnautica 2’s early access release might have been in doubt for 2025. That could have been through missing milestone already or from wanting more time. Papoutsis has been put in place to ensure that a product is delivered this year.</p>
<p>Papoutsis has come across from Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios. The tail end of Callisto Protocol’s development was mired in controversy over glorifying crunch culture at the studio, with employees pushed to work 6-7 day weeks. Then studio head <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Glen Schofield walking back and apologising</a> for comments that seemed to glorify this approach. In an interview following his departure from SDS, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">Schofield then claimed that Krafton forced the game to be released three months earlier</a> than had been agreed, leading to cut content and the aforementioned crunch.</p>

			<p>Imagine how much better the world would be if we all did parkour and freerunning. Your commute would be twice as fast if you could parkour your way across town to the office, the kids would never drag their heels on a Monday morning if they knew they could hand-spring and wall-run their way to school, and you’d never get bored waiting in line at Asda if you knew you could throw out a standing back-flip every now and again.</p>
<p>Well, prepare to be amazed, my friend. Because in Rooftops &amp; Alleys, everyone can be a freerunner. In your own living room. Whilst sat on your couch. Even while playing a video game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rooftops &amp; Alleys - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gkso_Cs85xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rooftops &amp; Alleys gives you six varied maps to explore, with a mixture of time trial and trick rush challenges scattered around for you to test your parkour skills and rack up points. Although the maps aren’t overly large, they don’t really need to be. A diverse range of platforms, poles, walls and ramps are carefully positioned to help you maximise your trick combos. Plus, there’s a handy pigeon mode that, a bit like in Assassin’s Creed, gives you a bird’s eye view of the map to plan your tricks and to help you access hard to reach places.</p>
<p>The music to Rooftops &amp; Alleys does cartwheels around other game soundtracks. This isn’t surprising, given that the solo developer behind MLMEDIA, Michel Losch, worked in the music industry for 15 years. The trance, R&amp;B and electronica vibes partner the game’s style and energy like a precisely executed Double Kong.</p>

<p>In fact, the soundtrack manages to achieve the goal that all good soundtracks should aim for – but all too many fall short of – it makes you <em>want</em> to play the game. It gets you in the mood and keeps you playing. So, I couldn’t help but wall-flip in and try my best to parkour like a pro.</p>
<p>And try I did. I tried. And tried. And tried.</p>
<p>And occasionally actually landed a free running move.</p>

<p>Free running is about the accurate and controlled execution of movements, and Rooftops and Alleys is no different with its controls. This game isn’t for button-mashing. No matter how frustrated you get when you JUST. CAN’T. DO. IT. RIGHT! The controls are tricky and require very precise input from the player. There is a helpful tutorial, but it only covers the basics of the tricks and aerials you can perform, leaving you feeling completely unprepared for when you throw yourself off a platform and faceplant the floor.</p>
<p>The gameplay is then made harder by occasionally fritzy controls. You can actually manage to press all the right buttons in the right order, but for some unknown reason, your avatar doesn’t do the thing you’ve asked it to do. It occasionally rag-dolls even when you’re not doing anything. Oh, and you can glitch through walls. It all adds up to a teeth-clenchingly frustrating ten minutes of trying to do wall-runs, failing miserably and then resisting the urge to parkour my controller straight into my TV screen.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all these major freerunning fails lead to some hilarious wipeouts! The sound effect of my avatar clanging their head on a pole then clattering to the floor made me laugh a lot more than it should. It’s this ability to laugh at yourself – and others! – that makes the online play so joyous. Chasing each other up the walls of a church just to take it in turns to clang the church bell with your noggin will never grow old. Plus, the good-sized fan network of Rooftops and Alleys means there’s always someone to play with, even if they’re as clumsy at the controls as you are.</p>

<p>So, is it cartwheels or wipeouts for Rooftops &amp; Alleys? Fans of the straightforward freerunning elements in Assassins Creed may be left a little overwhelmed by the demands of Rooftops &amp; Alleys. But those who love the point scoring system of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater will relish the challenge offered by the game. The thrill of completing a complex aerial trick with a perfect touchdown brings a true rush to the player, but if you struggle to grasp the complex inputs required, the gameplay suddenly becomes very limited. It’s because of this that Rooftops and Alleys didn’t really stick the landing for me.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rooftops and Alleys is close to being a flipping great parkour game. This trick-filled, point-scoring, freerunning experience has a banging soundtrack and hilarious online play, but the fussy and frustrating controls stop it from climbing to the next level.	</p></div>
