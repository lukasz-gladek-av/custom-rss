		<p>Frogwares has announced that it is releasing The Sinking City Remastered, with owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S getting this as a free upgrade. The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game being ported to Unreal Engine 5, joining The Sinking City 2 on that platform. While a trailer or gameplay footage is not yet available, Frogwares has released screenshots of The Sinking City Remastered.</p>

		
		

<p>In other The Sinking City 2 news, Frogwares has opened up submissions for people to have their voices in the game, becoming part of a choir that praises the Eldritch god Yog-Sothoth. To enter, people just need to submit a voice recording saying the word “Yes”, in whatever style they wish. A form will need to be filled out along with an upload of the submission, and that can all be done <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743346118601063&amp;usg=AOvVaw13x8tRr9K5rXe2MkOnnojn">at this link</a>. Frogwares will then choose 100 submissions at random to be in the game, and of of those 100 will get The Sinking City 2 Collector’s Edition.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em> “The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>
