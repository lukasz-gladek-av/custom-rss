		<p>Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is heading into Steam Early Access on 2nd April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year</a>, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games with World of Tanks, World of Warships and more. This free-to-play mech hero shooter blends together battle royale and extraction shooter ideas, and Wargaming are hoping that early access will help them to quickly refine that blend, with the expectation that they will quickly get to a full release after gathering community feedback. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/steel-hunters-open-beta-brings-stompy-off-on-steam/">This will build on what they learnt from closed beta</a> periods held over the last few months.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>
<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game when it launches in April… or both!</p>
