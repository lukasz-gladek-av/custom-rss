		<p>A fresh update roadmap for historical 4X game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been shared, alongside fresh information for the game’s first premium DLC, Untold Scenarios.</p>
<p>Oxide Games won’t be going it alone in supporting the game going forward, though, as Stardock Entertainment (best known for Galactic Civilizations and publishing Sins of the Solar Empire) is assuming production management. Oxide is still lead developer on the title, and the game is still being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this is a rejig of the game’s ongoing support, with Stardock having already collaborated with Oxide in the run up to release in September 2024 and through post-launch updates since then.</p>


<p>“With our decades of experience in delivering high-quality strategy games, Stardock is uniquely equipped to lead development on future content for Ara: History Untold,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games. “By listening closely to players, we’ll elevate the game’s history-defining potential for players everywhere.”</p>
<p>On the roadmap, May and June will build up to Version 1.4 (with a preview build), which will bring warfare updates, AI improvements in several areas, performance optimisation and more.</p>
<p>June will also see the paid Untold Stories DLC release with with new scenarios, maps, events, amenities, and technologies.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, this summer will bring Version 2.0 with more significant overhauls.</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

		<p>Already one of the most celebrated RPGs of recent years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is set to get a big new DLC adventure for free next month. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker will arrive on 20th May as a free upgrade across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Throes of the Watchmaker expands on the inventor known as the Watchmaker that you meet through the main adventure of Sea of Stars. Architect of the Clockwork Castle and the creator of the tabletop game Wheels within this world, he’s now gone and created a miniature clockwork world known as Horloge, which is being threatened by a cursed carnival. So you have to go and get all Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and miniaturise Zale and Valere to delve into this world and put an end to this evil plight.</p>
<p>Through the expansion, Zale and Valere will have a self-contained progression built around completely new classes, skills and combos. Zale will become a skilful juggler, while Valere transforms into an acrobat, fighting alongside new playable party member, the last-wielding sharpshooter Artificer.</p>
<p>As well as having new areas, puzzles and enemies, Sabotage has been able to lavish Throes of the Watchmaker with a cinematics budget equivalent to the main game, so expect some super pretty cutscenes!</p>

<p>Not only that, but the soundtrack will also feature more original songs by guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger), working alongside lead composer Eric W. Brown.</p>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “Sea of Stars has clearly been made by people with a deep and abiding love of JRPGs. That level of passion is hard to mimic, and the result is a heavily playable game with morish visuals, a cracking story and deeply considered level design. However, while it is very good, it isn’t quite perfect. Combat needed to be deeper (or at least escapable) and while the dynamism was a great touch, it wasn’t enough to carry it all the way through to the end.”</p>
<p>The game has been well supported over the past year and a half with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/sea-of-stars-free-dawn-of-equinox-update-adds-local-co-op-and-more/">major updates</a> that have overhauled combat, revamped the prologue and added local co-op play.</p>
