</ul>
<p>The Nightdive team has worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. There are improved models, textures and environments, and there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>

		<p>Raccoon Logic has announced that Revenge of the Savage Planet will release in May 2025, the sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey-to-the-savage-planet">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Revenge of the Savage Planet Gameplay Preview | PC Gaming Show" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WQ8EEDycDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer features Kindred Aerospace CEO Martin Tweed from the first game, as he reveals his new nemesis, Gunther Harrison, the CEO of rival Alta Interglobal, and some brand new gameplay.</p>
<p>You’ll notice one big change for this game compared to the original, in that it’s shifted to a third person view, letting you really soak in the bombastic cartoony animations of the characters as they run, slide, leap and blast their way through the game.</p>
<p>You’ve been abandoned on an alien planet after your mission to colonise it has been deemed a bit too spendy for Alta Interglobal. So, you’ll head out to explore, scavenge and salvage from habitats that were sent on a one way trip before the cutbacks, capture animals, upgrade gear and discover secrets. Also… there’s actually four planets in this game, all of which are savage.</p>

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet can be played solo or co-op (both split screen local or online) and with full crossplay.</p>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet originally launched in 2020, shortly after developer Typhoon Studios had been acquired by Google. It still launched crossplatform, though was ported to Stadia a little while later. Of course, we all know what happened to Stadia, and Google shutdown Typhoon Studios in the process. Thankfully the founders were able to set up Raccoon Logic with some backing from Tencent, and they reacquired the Savage Planet IP from Google, allowing this to be a full sequel and not one of those spiritual successors.</p>
<p>We had a great time with the original. Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">our Journey to the Savage Planet review</a>, “A rollicking space adventure, Journey to the Savage Planet has the smarts to make you laugh out loud while taking shots at consumerism and big business”</p>

			<p>The 2D/2.5D platformer has become a somewhat neglected genre in recent years. Aside from Mario Wonder, many of the main standout series have been dormant for some time. A few months ago the cancellation of Crash Bandicoot 5 was reported and it’s been 10 years since Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (6 since the Switch port). As a big fan of this style of game I was pleasantly surprised to hear about Nikoderiko – through a YouTube advert of all things. Initially, I was concerned that the game would turn out to be Crash from Wish but the full game is a well-made and polished platformer that is a welcome addition to the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nikoderiko: The Magical World - Feature Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExG4ce6anoM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving away from the antipodean marsupial of Naughty Dog’s series, you play as a pair of mongooses (mongeese?) who are depicted as Nathan Drake style treasure hunters – a portrayal which feels like a deliberate nod again to Crash’s original developers. This conscious reference is confirmed late in the game when a side character incorrectly identifies Niko and Luna as bandicoots, a clear sign both of the self-awareness of this game and also its meta sense of humour. The broader story is that the Cobra King has stolen a treasure chest found by the mongoose pair and they must venture across the land to track it down again.</p>


<p>Graphically, Nikoderiko is very much in keeping with the style of its influences. Bright and bold cartoony visuals abound with a variety of traditional biomes all present and correct. Enemies are very reminiscent of both DK and Crash’s foes, with the boss battles perhaps being more influenced by the former with larger-than-life encounters. Both Niko and Luna are well designed but it can be a little too easy to get them mixed up when playing in coop.</p>
<p>To make your way through the 30 or so levels of this adventure you’ll be running and jumping in very traditionally organised levels with regular checkpoints and lots of collectables. Instead of the genre’s popular double jump, the two heroes can glide across long distances (a characteristic that would better suit a flying squirrel surely?) &nbsp;Enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads or using your slide attack, the latter also being needed to traverse small gaps at times. At set points during levels you’ll also find barrels and chests that you can pick up to throw at more stubborn enemies. Towards the end of the game some challenging combinations of enemies require you to string together all your abilities in order to overcome them.</p>


<p>The majority of the time you’ll be travelling from left to right in the style of Donkey Kong Country with the occasional swimming level included for variety. The latter control really well and aren’t the low point that subnautical sections often are. You even unlock animal friends to help you through some levels with these often being designed around the special abilities of each. Alongside these level-specific appearances, however, you can also buy extra uses of the mounts to bring along to other levels – although this wasn’t something I used in my completed playthrough.</p>
<p>More in keeping with Crash Bandicoot, though, are the parts of some levels where you turn away from the camera (and less often run toward it) and take on a third dimension. These are a relatively smaller part of the game than the 2D sections but play out almost identical to the Bandicoot, even to the point of having some of the same issues with depth perception at times. Boss fights vary between the different perspectives too and are mostly challenging enough to be fun without being too annoying – unless you are trying for some of the more tricky boss-based trophies.</p>
<p>In terms of collectables, there are fireflies that serve as your main currency, coins and trophies that are used to unlock extra material via ingame lootboxes, letters that spell out NIKO (in a huge borrowing from DK), and finally large purple crystals. There is one crystal hidden on every main level and finding some of these adds an extra layer of exploration to your travels. The aforementioned lootboxes are not as egregious as that description might suggest since they are entirely self-contained and don’t require any microtransactions although some grinding will be necessary if you want to unlock everything.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the most positive aspects of Nikoderiko is the ability to play the whole game in local coop, with two players controlling each of the mongooses. This is always a huge addition to a game and should be celebrated. The main question with any single-screen coop is how it handles one player being too far ahead and Nikoderiko goes for the bubble mechanic. The trailing player will lose a heart and teleport back to the leading one in a protective bubble. This can be a little annoying, but as long as one player survives then the game continues so it isn’t as frustrating as it could have been.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really enjoyed my time with Nikoderiko: The Magical World. It's a blast in singleplayer, and after a good few evenings playing in coop with my kids I and can absolutely recommend it as a local multiplayer experience too. If you're a platforming fan, then this is one you won't want to miss.	</p></div>

		<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the follow up to the incredible Citizen Sleeper, will be releasing on January 31st for PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and will also be available day one on Game Pass. There is a limited time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/">Hexport demo</a> available now on Steam, but will only be playable until December 8th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryA2lZ-FEp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector’s story will take different route than the one in the original, though a few similar elements remain. As a Sleeper, you are on the run trying to escape from your past, but have little memory of it. In the first game, the goal was to survive and outwit your pursuers upon a space station, while trying to keep your android body functioning. In Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the goal is to get a ship, put together a crew, and explore the Starward Belt. You will still need to keep your body functioning, and decisions will be need to be made that will alter the course of your relationships and the story.</p>
<p>We awarded Citizen Sleeper our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/24/game-of-the-year-2022-best-narrative/">Best Narrative Game of the Year award for 2022</a>, and it was absolutely deserving of it. While we didn’t cover the original release, Aran checked out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">final DLC</a>&nbsp;for the game, saying, <em>“As a finale Purge is an excellent way to finish the tale of Citizen Sleeper. It ties up so many loose ends and gives fitting finales to many of the influential characters that you have met. There is one loose end regarding a particular character that I feel was not properly resolved, but at the same time it ties into the confusion of the events in the final stages. Yet, the door remains open for more stories set within this universe be it on The Eye or by following what happens out in the cosmos. This may be the end of the Sleeper’s story, but there are so many more characters who embark on new beginnings that offer worlds of narrative possibilities.”</em></p>
