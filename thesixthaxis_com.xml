		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>
