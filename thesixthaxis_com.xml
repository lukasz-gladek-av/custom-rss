			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach unfolds with deliberate, slow grace. The opening moments depict Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) and his adoptive daughter, Lou, embarking on a reflective journey home, navigating a breathtakingly photorealistic landscape bathed in the golden hues of a setting sun. A gentle, melancholic song by Woodkid drifts across the scenery, perfectly underscoring the serenity of the moment as Sam engages in endearing conversation with Lou, her delighted giggles echoing across the landscape.</p>
<p>As the pair advances, the weather takes a turn for the worse, the scorching sunlight giving way to a deluge of rain that lashes down. Rivulets of water weave through jagged rock formations, and slick mud clings to Sam’s legs. The meticulous environmental detail is so exquisitely rendered that I half expected David Attenborough to start narrating, extolling the majesty of this digital wilderness. The cinematography in this game is superb – so good that I’ve taken hundreds of pictures during my playthrough, and I don’t usually use an in-game photo mode.</p>

<p>The introduction leads into a visit by the enigmatic Fragile (Léa Seydoux), who chain-smokes Gauloises with theatrical fervour to remind us she’s<em> really, really</em>, French. Their exchange sets in motion Sam’s next objective: a mission to Mexico, the border of which is conveniently located a short stroll away. Once again, Sam must undertake the Herculean task of reconnecting isolated Mexican settlements to the Chiral Network (WiFi that uses the land of the dead rather than cables – just go with it), mirroring the sprawling odyssey across the continental United States that defined the first instalment.</p>
<p>Mexico functions primarily as a four-hour introduction, essentially a prologue that doubles as a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the mechanics of the original game. It meticulously walks players through the fundamentals of arranging cargo, constructing roads, and evaluating terrain — every single aspect that returning players already mastered in the first instalment is re-explained through methodical missions. While there are nominal additions, the most conspicuous change is that Sam now carries a child, thereby losing his ability to detect Beached Things (BTs) at a distance. In addition – prepare yourselves for this groundbreaking revelation — an experience points system has been added, offering marginal enhancements.</p>

<p>At this point, I began to grow concerned for what was to come. While there are a few moments of Kojima’s typical absurdity, there is also an awful lot of repetition from the first game, and while that is not a bad thing – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">I did give that game 10/10</a>, after all – it did leave me feeling disappointed.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460873">The Plate Gate that allows travel between Mexico and Australia.</p>
<p>The repetition is most obvious in the graphics and audio, which remain largely indistinguishable from its predecessor. The models and animations have undergone little to no evolution, the sound effects are recycled, and Mexico and every other region you traverse bears a striking uniformity. Deserts, forests, grasslands, and snowy peaks are all represented, yet they are so generically rendered that, without a label on a map, it would be impossible to say if you are walking to Mexico City, Melbourne, or Manchester. A core appeal of post-apocalyptic settings lies in the thrill of uncovering iconic landmarks in ruin – tangible remnants of a once-familiar world. As some pre-Death Stranding architecture remains intact within the game it would have helped to include the decimated husk of the Sydney Opera House in a distant corner of the map, simply to provide a geographic anchor.</p>
<p data-start="80" data-end="864">The majority of its innovations are, in essence, minor refinements of mechanics already present in the original game. Take, for instance, the Cargo Cannons. They return from the original, but can now fire grenades so you can use them as improvised weaponry. While mildly amusing, this is hardly the kind of inventive thinking one has come to expect from a Kojima production.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460874">Tar Man meets the utterly adorable Tar Kitty.</p>
<p>Even mission design suffers from repetition. The ridiculous timed pizza delivery returns, complete with identical constraints: keep the box perfectly level and arrive within a strict time limit. Was there truly no time over five years to reimagine this task with something more novel? A precariously stacked tower of gourmet burgers, perhaps, or a box of delicately fragranced chicken wings susceptible to jostling? Instead, we are given a recycled objective that reinforces the feeling that this sequel is struggling to forge a distinct identity beyond that of its predecessor.</p>
<p>What I’m playing is a retread of the same surreal Kojima flourishes: infants sealed in artificial wombs, viscous tar-like apparitions, spectral entities lurking in the mist. All were new and exciting in the first game, but now they barely register a reaction. From a world-building perspective, the stagnation is at least narratively justified—the sequel unfolds a mere nine months after the events of Death Stranding<i>—</i>but from a creative standpoint the experience feels, and I can scarcely believe I’m applying this word to a Kojima production, indolent.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460875">The team discuss their next move.</p>
<p>The entire Mexico segment is narratively dispensable, save for a fleeting appearance by Higgs (Troy Baker), and once a pivotal moment takes Sam toward Australia, the game reverts to the precise framework of Death Stranding. Once again, Sam is equipped with a Bridge Baby (BB) contained in a pod and once again, the player is tasked with methodical traversal, network reconnection, and infrastructural expansion. It’s not until ten hours in that the actual narrative begins to emerge with the introduction of Tomorrow (Elle Fanning) and Neil (Luca Marinelli), the latter assuming a role strikingly similar to that of Mads Mikkelsen in the first game: a morally ambiguous figure trapped in a Chiral purgatory, this time resembling a nightmare version of Mexico, who pursues Sam with a battalion of spectral soldiers. Soon after, we meet Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), and if you fail to deduce her abilities just before embarking on a mission involving a forest fire, congratulations, the ensuing reveal may still surprise you. The rest of us are unlikely to be so fortunate.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460871">Sam goes surfing on a coffin.</p>
<p>While there’s so much familiarity, your gradual expansion of the Chiral Network and infrastructure is still strangely satisfying,&nbsp;and before long I found myself engaging in side missions and obsessively completing every stretch of road. Alongside all the returning tools from DS1 is the DHV Magellan, a tar-based craft that appears near settlements once they are brought online. This mobile base allows for instantaneous transport between regions, including all stored cargo and even vehicles. Instead of laboriously driving across terrain, I could load up a truck with materials, drive it into the DHV Magellan, and teleport across the map in moments, although the game does disable this mode of transport at key points so you do have to do some of the hard work. Another substantial addition is the monorail system: construct the full line, and you and an impressive amount of cargo can go soaring above hostile landscapes with ease.</p>
<p>Your progress is still bound to the same upgrades as found in DS1, even if that makes little sense when Australia is meant to exist within the same Chiral Network as the US – surely Sam should be able to fabricate everything already? A few additions stand out though, such as the introduction of teleportation devices and, most delightfully, a high-velocity Coffin Surfboard. Yes, a coffin that doubles as a surfboard, capable of gliding at great speed across any terrain including water, snow and tar. During combat, you can even leap inside and momentarily escape into the realm of the dead.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460876">Neil, his soldiers, and an awful lot of fireworks. You have to see this in motion it is spectacular!</p>
<p>The asynchronous multiplayer connectivity found in Death Stranding returns in its sequel, allowing players to once again encounter structures, signs, and vehicles left behind by others as they traverse the world. This seems to be have been significantly amplified with overly generous results. Strategic mission planning becomes redundant when ladders, ropes, and other structures appear with uncanny precision wherever you might require them. I quickly abandoned the effort of carefully equipping myself, knowing that, inevitably, another player would have placed the precise tool or building I needed at the optimal location. There is an option to limit the amount of help you receive, so I suggest you turn that on from the start.</p>
<p>Combat encounters remain a highlight and raiding human encampments provide thrills and spectacle. The gunplay feels substantial and tactile—evocative of Killzone in its weight—and the enemy AI behaves with satisfying realism. Higgs’ robotic legions are deployed sparingly, but when they do appear the mix of humanoid and bestial adversaries brings a welcome unpredictability to encounters. These animalistic foes pounce from afar or dart past you with sudden ferocity making them a very different enemies from the humanoids.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460877">Is this Mexico, the USA, Australia, or Croydon? Who can tell.</p>
<p>There are hints at new gameplay mechanics, though they often falter in execution. One mission tasked me with recapturing an escaped kangaroo for Chvrches , the real-world pop group who make a suitably surreal cameo. I had high hopes: perhaps a mini-game involving stealth or pursuit but I instead walked up to the animal,&nbsp; wrangled it into a container, and completed the objective. Likewise there are now Gate Quakes which shudder the land and can trigger an avalanche or rockfall. However. most of the time the screen shakes and not a single pebble moves, a random boulder plummeting down a hill would have added some excitement, even if it was off in the distance.</p>
<p>BTs, the tar-drenched phantoms that were a constant presence in DS1 are less of a threat as vast swaths of the map are devoid of of them. I found myself missing the tension of barrelling down a highway only to be abruptly confronted by squid-like terror erupting from the earth. When they do appear, there are some new variants, the most compelling of which is a colossal winged entity that soars overhead, deploying explosive payloads and countermeasures with the sophistication of a modern aircraft. Their seemingly erratic design belies a deeper narrative significance which is revealed in an epic battle near the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460879">More deliveries than Amazon.</p>
<p>Given just how deeply reminiscent so much of this game is to its predecessor, I feared the experience might conclude without anything exceptional. It’s a sequel, so there’s bound to be common ground, but it feels like the second episode of a TV series rather than a blockbuster movie sequel. That is until Hideo Kojima metaphorically bursts onto the stage after 30 hours and the game descended into glorious, unhinged chaos. The story, which had until that point been a personal tale with subtlety and emotional restraint, suddenly swerves into a realm of outrageous, genre-defying spectacle. A late-game revelation left me so stupefied I had to pause for half an hour and process exactly what I had been told. Somehow, it makes sense within Kojima’s meticulously crafted mythology, but it is unquestionably batshit insane. Even if you had a hundred years, you would never guess what had been going on.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 ends on a high – a deliriously absurd, emotionally resonant, and breathtakingly bold high. I whooped. I laughed. I cursed. I even shed a tear. It was, without question, the most fun I’ve had in a game this year. Troy Baker absolutely steals the show in these final hours, delivering a performance that channels the anarchic menace of Heath Ledger’s Joker, amplified to eleventy-stupid. Norman Reedus, largely reserved throughout the journey and communicating in terse grunts, also steps into the spotlight with a moment of genuine pathos and gravitas to deliver at just the right time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re a returning fan of the series, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4 might make you question the nature of time and mortality. The demo for this remade duology – currently available to those that pre-order the game on PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC – opens with a collection of live footage from the included skaters, that roster including Riley Hawk, Tony Hawk’s adult son, 15 year-old Chloe Cavell, and Olympic star Rayssa Leal, who was born in 2008. For all that this is a remake and remaster of two games from 2001 and 2002, time has definitely passed for Tony Hawk and the skateboarding scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYmlS8zwb5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What it does show is that the skateboarding scene is not just alive and well, it’s kickflipping its way into a whole new generation’s hearts. The easy ability to share clips worldwide, the sport reaching all the way to the Olympics, and the resurgence of games like Skate and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater speaks to a sport that’s in rude health. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is only going to cement that further.</p>


<p>The demo gives you two skaters, Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, though there is a third available if you’ve preordered the Deluxe Edition of the game. That third option is the Slayer from Doom, and maybe it’s just me, but does the Doom guy really seem like the most obvious choice for hitting a wicked Manual and bouncing into a cool kickflip? Weirder tie-ins exist, for sure, but I don’t think it’s the biggest draw for a Deluxe Edition, which also gives you a horrific alien Revenant skater too. If Doom is your favourite franchise, then maybe you’re spending the extra. At least Bam Margera is lurking around the final release.</p>
<p>The demo has two areas, Foundry and College, and it’s little surprise to find that these levels look absolutely stunning on current-gen hardware. Running in 4K, 60fps on PlayStation 5, Foundry has molten metal and jets of steam spilling out into the arena, as well as a focused set of rails, ramps and half-pipes, with the build feeling quite claustrophobic, forcing you to make split-second decisions to keep your combo going.</p>


<p>It’s definitely a more intense option compared to the sprawling College level. Here, those two minutes you’re given feel utterly lacking, as the number of options, hard-to-reach sections and potential routes spiral into the hundreds, if not thousands. It looks stunning, and I loved re-learning the techniques that fans of the series will have embedded in the back of their brain. Rightly or wrongly, grinds and manuals feel more natural now, flowing together more readily than they did when I was younger, but perhaps that’s just the result of familiarity and practice that have been years in the making.</p>
<p>Even in the demo you can dig into your skater’s setup swapping out or adding additional special moves, changing the inputs for these, or altering a few of the cosmetic options, like the board designs. You do earn money through each run, and while there’s no options here to spend it, I’m sure you’ll be buying your favourite skater’s different looks in the full release.</p>
<p>That will undoubtedly play into the upcoming Create-A-Skater mode, so you’ll be able to put yourself (or at least a version of yourself that can ride a skateboard without falling off) into the game. That sits handily alongside the Create-A-Park mode, which lets you create your own park from the ground up. I’m expecting this to run better than ever too, with the current gen horsepower behind them.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s would be nothing without the right soundtrack, and the demo gives you the requisite mix of bands like CKY and Motorhead nuzzling up to Lupe Fiasco for a great mix of vibes while you attempt to land that 900. It’s a real shame to find that some songs from the original games have been cut – an announcement from Alien Ant Farm dropped this week saying they were out – but we won’t know the full track list until we have the final game in our hands. You can remove any songs from the rotation if you don’t like them, and there’s some original tracks from Logan Byers that you can add in as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest surprise about THPS3+4 is that Activision have opted for a mid-range pricepoint of £39.99, which feels like a great price to jump in at, particularly on Switch 2 during its release window. For those on Xbox, it’s also going to be there day one on Game Pass, giving you no reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk’s has never felt smoother, or looked better, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like the perfect way to blend the old-school and the new-school together when it releases for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
