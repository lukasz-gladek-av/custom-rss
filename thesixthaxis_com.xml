			<p>Nioh has been one of my favourite takes on the Soulslike genre ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/07/nioh-review/">the original launched in 2017</a>. Not only does this series have a stellar aesthetic, but you get to enjoy being surrounded by some of the coolest monster designs going (thanks to the Japanese folklore that they’re based on), and the more fluid approach to combat and Diablo-style loot progression means you’re always moving forward and you can dive in deep or just enjoy hitting things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/10/nioh-2-review/">Nioh 2 was substantially better</a> than the first one, and I’m very happy to report that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is substantially better than the second one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Launch Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MyenuEg-z1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as Tokugawa Takechiyo, the grandchild of Tokugawa Ieyasu, your goal in Nioh 3 is to save the world from his nefarious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, who has upended the natural order of the world. Spanning multiple periods of Japanese history, each has been corrupted by a massive Yokai known as the Crucible, which is drawn to a mineral known as Crucinite and turns people into monster.&nbsp;The actual characters and story are a little derivative, but the writing and spectacle of it all really help cement it as being something very enjoyable. That’s just why you’re fighting though, and frankly it’s <em>how</em> you’re fighting and exploring the world that makes this game so very special.</p>


<p>Where you could always build your character to suit different playstyles in the first two games, Nioh 3 gives you two forms to switch between,&nbsp;with one being Samurai and one being Ninja. These dictate which weapons you can use, along with which special abilities as well. Samurai can still switch stances, as with the previous games, and restore stamina in combat with a well-timed Ki Pulse, while Ninja get access to ninjutsu that recharge as you deal damage to enemies and has an evasive Mist move as a Ki Pulse alternative.</p>


<p>You can build these two styles separately, having Samurai being a tank with low movement speed and the Ninja being a lot faster, but that’s just the most obvious direction to take and there’s more flexibility to choose your own playstyles. There are benefits to both, and the game looks to encourage you to swap back and forth, most notably by letting you can deflect otherwise unblockable attacks by switching between the two with good timing. Oh, and you can just do auto-equip for both as well, where it’ll keep your weapon preferences in mind and then just optimise your armour at different agility levels.</p>
<p>Along with that, you get access to Onmyo magic, which gets stronger if you invest in it. This lets you summon the souls of defeated Yokai to help you, but can also turn them into consumable items that recharge when you pray at a shrine. You can then further go down all of these as you level up by allocating stats, picking skills to take for each form, and more. All of this is an awful lot to deal with, and can feel daunting for the sheer wealth of possibilities, but don’t worry, you can re-spec whenever you want. It makes for a wonderfully flexible system.</p>

<p>When it comes to exploration, instead of going on missions or having a more wide-linear path through the world, you’re now just let loose in an open sandbox set in a particular time period. There are a few of these periods to explore, and each one is split into multiple individual regions which let you pick up buffs the more you explore them. There are multiple areas that feel like individual Nioh missions just put into an open world, and that’s incredibly. There’s something wonderful about just wondering into a cave and finding out it’s a whole adventure all on its own. You even gain new exploration abilities as you go through the game, acting almost like a Metroidvania-style secret system.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is an incredibly expansive game that never feels empty, encourages multiple playstyles and the ability to flit between them at will, and a gorgeous world to explore with some of the coolest boss designs I’ve had the pleasure to fight. It can be a bit silly sometimes, with enemy AI not noticing you assassinating a friend of theirs just a few feat away with lots of loud and squishy noises, but it’s just too much fun for that to be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, you have the returning ability to play through the whole game in co-op, though I’ve not had a chance to do so prior to release. You can still summon people to help you just for a particular boss battle – either other players or NPC characters – &nbsp;but the idea of running around these massive regions with a friend is one that’s just deeply appealing to me. I’ve been wanting to play another open-world game for a while, and I’d sort of forgotten that’s what Nioh 3 was promising. This game is hitting the spot in every possible way.</p>

		<p>While tennis fever won’t sweep across the UK until the strawberries are ripe and the hills have sprouted Henmans, Aussies would tell you that the tennis season is well underway. And so would Nintendo, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-swich-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in just a couple weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever arrives in what, to my mind at least, is the strange scenario of its direct predecessor still being eminently playable on the Switch 2. I’m sure you can imagine how I felt when I was reminded that Mario Tennis Aces actually came out in 2018? It’s been eight years? When did that happen? Perhaps the curious memory hole that Aces found itself in isn’t helped by, well, this fundamentally still being a tennis game… with Mario and crazy super-powers.</p>


<p>Our hands-on time started with a brief tutorial, running through the core controls and new Fever Rackets. It’s immediately very familiar, with your standard shot types spread across the four face buttons, the ability to pull of a strong double-tap Powerful Shot, and the held Charge Shot. Positioning is important, but this is a thoroughly forgiving game in terms of shot timing. If you or your opponent misstime things, then a Star Shot smash opportunity is highlighted on the court for you to race to and try to take advantage of.</p>


<p>Where Mario Tennis Fever starts to distinguish itself from Aces is with the much larger roster of characters to play as – introducing Baby Waluigi for the very first time alongside the lesser seen Baby Wario – each with particular stats and attributes, and that your Special Shot is now determined by which racket they are holding. Fever Rackets can do all manner of things, from leaving burning chunks of rock on the court to whipping up localised tornadoes, summoning shadowy allies, and more. The trick to the Fever Rackets is that these can be returned with good positioning and timing, bouncing their ill effects back to the other side of the court.</p>
<p>With the basics mastered, we hopped into multiplayer for 1v1 and 2v2 matches, and I had a great time of it. There’s a great arcade foundation for this game, and I loved being able to send truly wicked slices that swerved off the court, while the quick double-tap Powerful Shot was my mainstay for a rally.</p>

<p>But things got silly as we started to lean on the Fever Racket shots, with this meter building up much more quickly than in Mario Tennis Aces. While I only really got to explore a handful of the effects the rackets offered, the way that some of the effects would stick around between points made them very powerful. Being able to lock off certain parts of the court with burning coals, or purposefully aiming for twisters to try and send the ball in befuddling directions, and having these affect multiple points was a huge advantage. The Mud Racket, though, is massively overpowered. This creates pools of mud that splatter the screen like the squid ink from Mario Kart… but it will do it every time the ball splats into a muddy patch! At the very least, you need to try and return this to the other side of the net to try and share some of the pain, but it feels like a very powerful racket, so long as you don’t suffer the backsplash.</p>
<p>Running into damaging hazards will also drain a player’s HP, and getting hit by too much damage will knock them out of the match for a few moments. It was particularly tense when this happened in doubles, as I frantically tried to hold out until my partner was able to (miraculously) rejoin and hit the winner from the net.</p>

<p>Things already get pretty chaotic when there’s four players, all with distinct racket abilities, but what if you threw even more modifiers into the mix? The Mix It Up mode adds further special rules and special courts. The Racket Factory spawns new rackets for you to grab if you hit a quadrant on the other side of the court, and there’s also Ring Shot, Pinball and a tricky-looking Forest Court which grows and shrinks over time.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wildest of the bunch is the Wonder Court Match. Inspired by Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it tasks you with collecting Wonder Seeds that float above the net with your directed shots, but halfway through the match, a Wonder Flower will appear and bring a grand transformation to the court. We’ve seen the net turn into a set of green pipes that can move up and down, while another has Piranha Plants walking back and forth like it’s the Mushroom Kingdom Fashion Week or something. You still need to keep grabbing Wonder Seeds in order to win.</p>

<p>Mario Tennis Fever has plenty in common with Mario Tennis Aces, but the focus has shifted just a little to give it more of a party game vibe. The Zone Shot system of before felt like it was all about hitting a finisher for a single point, but as you direct a Fever Shot in this sequel, it’s more about injecting another wild variable and obstacle. If the adventure mode can be a bit more engaging this time around, this could be a really fun entry for all players.</p>
