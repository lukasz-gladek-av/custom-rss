		<p>Frontier has now previewed what’s next for their latest theme park management game, Planet Coaster 2, with a new roadmap for May and June.</p>
<p>Arriving on 29th May is Update 5, which will include fan requested features like security guards and expanded colour customisations. The Sci-Fi theme will also return, while there’s two de-themed coasters that will allow for greater customisation alongside the returning Vector – Return Mk 2, and the maps from Act 3 of the career will be available in Sandbox mode.</p>



<p>Looking further ahead to June, Update 6 will bring Souvenir Shops and On-Ride Photos that will be sold at those shops (at no doubt extortionate prices!). There will be more stock coasters and the returning Coriolis ride, and then more ongoing stability and performance enhancements. Another returning theme is also teased, with Frontier saying that “It’s a real fairy tale come true.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 launched at the tail end of 2024, Frontier looking to find new ways to expand on their popular theme park game with a fresh release, instead of bolting on features with DLC and patches. In particular, they added new water park areas with water slides, wide plaza areas and more, though fans initially complained that it felt like a step back in terms of the number of themes and certain features, and some bugginess. Frontier has steadily worked to add more to the game since then, resolving key complaints and generally making improvements, and it seems that it’s kicking into gear with the next few updates.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/planet-coaster-2-review/">our Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Frontier’s park-building sequel is a vibe, it is a mood, and it is sunshine wrapped in a very bright bow. Minor control frustrations aside, it’s the best theme park builder out there, with impressively deep customisation, beautifully detailed visuals and the ability to make hours of your life melt away.”</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has revealed what players should expect in the first year of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with the studio releasing the year one roadmap for the game. Included in the first year are free missions called Story Drops, the first expansion called the Claws of Awaji, New Game+, and further updates to Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Year 1 Roadmap Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Claws of Awaji expansion, which will be available at no additional cost to those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows, will add the island of Awaji and continues the story of both Yasuke and Naoe following the epilogue of the main questline. Naoe will be getting a new weapon with that being the Bo Staff, which can be used to fight the new enemies that will be added to the game. Both characters will be getting additional abilities too.</p>
<p>Another new addition to Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be story drops, free quests that expand upon the backstories of various characters. These story drops will also add new abilities and new activities in the world. The first of these story drops will be “The Works of Luis Frois”, which will focus on the Jesuit scholar whose works had documented a lot of the Sengoku era of Japan. This story drop will be added in early made.</p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the parkour system in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be optimised and new interactions will be brought in. These include height-gaining back-ejects, reanimated height-gaining side-ejects, and a vertical ledge jumps so characters can grab on to awnings and low overhangs. There will be more parkour improvements added through the year. The photo mode will be improved too, with new poses, expressions, filters, stickers and ambient music. In June, the second community feedback update will be rolled out which will allow players to toggle headgear being visible in cutscenes, giving the option to disable weapon glints and stealth outlines, black-and-white and red ability filters, and assassination celebration effects. The alarm system will be expanded to the open world as well.</p>


<p>In our Assassin’s Creed Shadows review, Adrian said, <em>“Fans of Assassin’s Creed have waited an era or two for a series entry that lets you be a ninja and explore Feudal Japan. Thankfully, the wait has been absolutely worth it. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an astonishing achievement. Vast, impossibly detailed, immaculately researched, and enormously fun, Shadows is easily one of the best games in this storied franchise.”</em></p>
