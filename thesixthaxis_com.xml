		<p>Star Wars Outlaws patch 1.5.1 has been released, fixing a couple of bugs and introducing the latest versions of DLSS and PSSR upscaling.</p>
<p>On PC, DLSS 4 has been added to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, supporting multi frame generation for the GeForce RTX 50 series, but also bringing a new transformer model to the table for all generations of RTX cards, improving the quality of the machine learning upscaling effort. Additionally, this transformer model also affects DLSS Ray Reconstruction to improve the fidelity of ray tracing in general, and can be used for super resolution and DLAA for anti-aliasing.</p>


<p>Over on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, Star Wars Outlaws now supports a newer version of PSSR upscaling, hoping to address complaints about the image quality from around the PS5 Pro’s launch. While it was expected to be possible, this is the first time that we’ve publicly heard about Sony being able to upgrade the PSSR upscaling model on PS5 Pro, so this is definitely very interesting and could see improvements rolled out to other games, though it will likely require game updates as opposed to having Sony unilaterally update the model across the whole system.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.5.1:</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws on PC now features DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 series, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame. DLSS 4 also introduces faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage for RTX 50 and 40 Series, and new transformer AI models for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX GPUs, which enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion.</em></p>

</ul>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>
