		<p>Netmarble has announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released on May 21st for PC and mobile devices. This Game of Thrones title puts you in the boots of the heir to House Tyre, a small noble House from the North. You are instructed by Jon Snow to travel around Westeros to rally the Great Houses and the lords of the realm to fight against the White Walkers.</p>

<p>There will be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin, with a a focus on player vs player combat as well as combat against threats that stalk the wilds of Westeros. Players will have the chance to roam freely through familiar settings including Castle Black, King’s Landing, and High Garden.</p>

<p>Dom spent some time earlier this year playing Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and in his preview he said, <em>“The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos. Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes.”</em></p>

<p>As mentioned in Dom’s preview, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be a free to play title, though people can buy founder’s packs to play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/"> the early access version of the game</a> on PC via Steam. If you are a mobile player, you can pre-register your interest by following the links; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on the App&nbsp;Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got&amp;pli=1">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – Apps on Google Play</a>.</p>

		<p>Gearbox and Sony have announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> gameplay deep dive State of Play will stream tomorrow, 30th April, through the official PlayStation Twitch and YouTube channels.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to tune in from 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST to see over 20 minutes of developer-led gameplay to show what’s new, old and a bit different about this latest game in the hit looter shooter series.</p>


<p>In a further surprise, Borderlands 4’s release date is now set for 12th September across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC – this is actually earlier than was announced in February’s State of Play by two weeks. Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox is now owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>, and Take-Two’s constantly said that GTA 6 will launch in late 2025, perhaps there’s a bit of insider knowledge as the company looks to make as much money as possible?</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s showcase will be hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson. This will see the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos and take down the Timekeeper, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>
