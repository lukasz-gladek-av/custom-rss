		<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/samson-is-a-new-action-game-by-former-just-cause-devs-new-studio/">Samson</a> was revealed by Christofer Sundberg’s Liquid Swords studio, showing a gritty open world game set in the city of Tyndalston. The main story sees Samson in a mountain of debt so he needs to take on all sorts of jobs to try and clear it, or suffer the consequences. Now, a new FAQ about Samson has gone live, with the key points being the story is about 10 hours but exploring everything can take around 25 hours, and the game will be coming to consoles but after the PC launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435">Samson FAQ</a> has also confirmed that the game is expected in early 2026 and will be priced at $24.99. There is no multiplayer and no microtransactions, with Samson being a single player title. There will be localisation, with different languages steadily being rolled out, but this will only apply to text as voice acting will not be localised. For the gameplay, players will be able to unlock new perks but won’t have a standard weapon loadout. Instead items in the environment can be picked and used for fights, while vehicle combat will also be heavy and a core part of the game. There has been some influence from Just Cause, the series Christofer Sundberg is credited with creating, but not in the chaotic and silly sense. It will be much more grounded with outcomes that could be unpredictable. You can drive any car in the game, but you won’t be able to drag civilians out of their vehicles. Instead stealing cars that are parked seems to be the way to get a new ride, though this will draw attention. Each vehicle will have its own handling style, which then leans into each one being useful for different playstyles.</p>
<p>According to the FAQ the city will respond to Samson’s actions too. It says,<em> “Law enforcement escalates based on your actions. Civilians react to what you do and how you behave.&nbsp; For example you need to watch out if you steal a parked car, if the police are nearby, they will spot and pursue you. They’ll escalate their efforts as you try to shake them off, making for an intense experience, testing all of your skills and knowledge about the city to escape. The city responds. It does not just sit there.”&nbsp;</em>It goes on to say this about police chases. <em>“Law enforcement is something to respect. Chases escalate, pressure builds, and mistakes matter. The goal is tension, not spectacle for its own sake.”</em></p>

<p>The PC minimum specs have also been confimed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>
</ul>
