		<p>Moonshot Games has announced a brand new team based shooter set in space, and it is called Wildgate. Wildgate will mix up space combat, looting, ship boarding, and a whole lot of first person shooting. If that sounds like something right up your street, you wonâ€™t have to wait long as there is going to be a&nbsp; <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/en-US/playtest/">Wildgate community playtest</a> from April 10th to April 14th which will be on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<p>In Wildgate, five teams of four known as Prospectors travel through hostile regions of space, which are randomised each time. to search for a treasure known as the Artifact. Finding the Artifact and escaping with it is one way to win the match. The other is to dominate by destroying the rival team ships however you can. That includes facing off in ship to ship combat or boarding enemy ships to sabotage them from within.</p>
<p>Going back to the community playtest, Moonshot Studios has stated that the full game will be available to play, but signing up for the playtest does not guarantee that you will get a key for it.

The game will also feature audio and text in the following languages; English, French, German, Italian, Castilian Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. There will also be traditional Chinese text.</p>
