		<p>Permafrost will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2026, SpaceRocket Games has announced today, but a playtest will be taking place ahead of the early access release. You can register for the Permafrost playtest now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254990/Permafrost/">Steam page</a>. Along with the early access announcement, a new trailer for Permafrost has been released showing various elements of gameplay including base building, hunting, and co-operative play.</p>

<p>In a blog post, the development team said, <em>“First of all, thank you for your support and patience throughout the last year. Your dedication to providing critical feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical troubleshooting during our demo was a literal game changer. With your help, we have been able to lock in the vision for our Early Access release – we have been in the icy trenches since – focusing on improving the core elements of the game, including stability, performance, and key gameplay foundations. So, this brings us to the release date. Permafrost will release into Early Access in 2026. We want to bring the best possible Early Access release build to you – one that’s not rushed, but rather polished and with a solid foundation, built with your feedback, reports, and requests. In other words, it’s for the best. We know it sucks to wait, but hang in there and let the devs cook, it will be worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Permafrost takes place in a world where the moon shattered and Earth plunged into a never-ending ice age. Among this icy world, players will need to find scarce resources, hunt for food, and work with each other to survive the wintry landscape. The game supports four player co-op but there may be clashes with groups that are not your own. The cold will be an ever present danger to all players, so building shelters will be necessary to survive. The development team will be releasing a deep dive on Permafrost next week to delve more into the game’s systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the firing of 30 employees last week and accusations that this was an attempt to stymie efforts by employees to unionise, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rockstar">Rockstar</a> has issued a statement that says the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a Rockstar spokesperson said, “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>


<p>All of the affected employees – with 30 to 40 people fired from across the company’s studios in the UK and Canada – were part of a private trade union chat on Discord. There were outsiders within this chat, but they were there from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) as labor organisers.</p>
<p>Following the dismissals last week, the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a> as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>
<p>Marshall has responded to Rockstar’s new allegations to say the company is&nbsp;“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritising union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Rockstar has always been a very secretive studio, something that goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of their games to make leaks of their work huge news stories. For GTA 6, the game has had two very high-profile leaking moments, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/19/rockstar-games-releases-statement-on-gta-6-leak/">a 2022 hack</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/02/gta-6-leak-rockstar-employee/">the friend of an employee’s son leaking more screens and details in 2023</a>. That latter moment was quickly followed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/rockstar-plans-full-return-to-office-for-gta-6-developers-citing-security-and-productivity/">Rockstar calling employees to return to offices for work</a>, having necessarily loosened this requirement and allowed work from home since 2020 – we all know why that was…</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to release on 26th May 2026, as Rockstar eventually decided that they needed more time, despite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs constantly stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>. But that’s been good news for 2025’s slate of releases, so where games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> had been fairly tentative about launching this year, they could launch with more confidence. That game’s knocked it out of the park, as well, no doubt helped just a little by not having to compete with GTA 6 for the average gamer’s wallet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Painkiller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/painkiller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review.1345429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Painkiller is a series I’ve certainly heard of, but I couldn’t tell you either way whether or not I’ve played it. I must have at some point, I’m sure, because I played every single thing I could get my hands on, but I can’t actually remember doing so. What I do remember that it’s similar to Doom, including all the hellish monsters and environments. You enter a room, kill a legion of monsters, then move onto the next room, where another legion awaits your bullets. This co-op reboot of this two decade old series gets this right, at least, but it’s a bit uninspired because of this.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQjQKqzSssk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will start with the good stuff. Painkiller looks pretty good, the environments are cool in that heavy metal album cover sort of way, full of large ominous bits that trigger the imagination. The music, whilst perhaps a little on the generic side of metal background tunes, does its job of getting the blood pumping whilst you’re wading through demons well enough.</p>


<p>The best part of the game is the gunplay, gun customisation, and traversal though. There are a few guns here, though not nearly as many as you’d hope, but the two starting weapons are real highlights. The first is a stake gun, which shoots a large wooden spike and can be upgraded to pierce through enemies or shoot three stakes at a time, both of which make it incredibly satisfying to use. The second gun fires shurikens that bounce off surfaces and can be upgraded to ricochet off enemies into others nearby and is, again, incredibly enjoyable once you’ve got an upgrade.</p>
<p>The unlockable weapons include slightly more standard weapons like a shotgun, an SMG, a handcannon, and a rocket launcher, but with similar, very powerful upgrades that make them enjoyable to use. That said, after using the stake thrower with the three stakes upgrade, it felt a lot like using the shotgun once I unlocked it, and the stake thrower with the impaling upgrade feels quite a bit like the handcannon.</p>


<p>These guns also have a secondary fire which, when used on bigger enemies with proper health bars, will fill up their stun meter. Once that’s full, you can charge over and completely obliterate them with your one remaining weapon: the Painkiller. It’s effectively a chainsaw, even if it’s more of a spinning shuriken on a stick, and in addition to shredding anything that comes near it, it also generates ammo from enemies it kills. This is handy, of course, because you’re in deep trouble if you run out of ammo when one of the bigger enemies turns up. Clever use of the Painkiller, which has a cooldown for use without stunning an enemy first, and secondary fire can very quickly shred through a bigger enemy’s health bar, which is very satisfying to do.</p>
<p>As for traversal, you can’t sprint, but you can slide. Functionally this works very similarly but is faster when going down hill, slower when going up hill, and knocks enemies out of the way in a comical fashion when there’s a lot of them around. You also have a dodge button, which has two charges that each have a cooldown, that also knocks enemies out of the way. The combination of this movement system and powerful, creative weapons is a great one, making you feel truly powerful even whilst you’re desperately fighting for your life against a horde of beasties. It really can be enjoyable whilst you’re in the thick of all the chaos. One issue in traversal is grapple points not triggering when they should, or sometimes missing your enemy with the Painkiller, which is strange and can catapult you off ledges.</p>

<p>It’s a shame, really, that nothing else in the game lives up to these features. Level design is dull and generic, relying strongly on the kind of mechanics you see in an MMO, like killing enemies within a certain area, or around a barrel that collects their blood that can be shoved into a socket to progress once filled. Or perhaps that <em>totally different</em> mechanic where the barrel collects souls instead. These mechanics even turn up in boss fights, which are messy to say the least and sometimes devolve into frustration.</p>
<p>There are the most basic of basic puzzles dotted through the levels that require two people to get through occasionally – i.e. one to stand on a button and one to go through the door it opens, which usually have a cache of “loot,” if you can call it that as there’s really only four options, gold, health, ammo, and a lure that attracts enemies until they’ve depleted its health.</p>
<p>There are four characters, but beyond their designs – especially Void who seems to have a starfield for a face – and some brief dialogues between them during gameplay, they’re not particularly interesting mechanically or storywise. They each have a particular stat boost that is small enough to be nearly irrelevant, and the story here is almost non-existent. You are in purgatory for various crimes, but Metatron (the biblical voice/scribe of god) offers you a way out, by stopping the fallen angel Azazel from unleashing his demonic hordes onto Earth. You do this by fighting them across three areas, each split into three levels with a boss, and then Azazel. That’s the whole game.</p>

<p>There’s also a tarot card system that mostly seems superfluous because, whilst you’re still unlocking and upgrading your weapons, you spend the resources on doing that, and once you’re done upgrading your weapons, you’ve got little-to-no game left to use them in. The cards can give you useful bonuses such as increased health, quicker secondary fire regen, but I barely used them because they use the same resources to unlock and, once you’ve used a card once, it’s burnt and you have to restore it using the same resources. Not if you died or failed a level whilst using it, just every single time you use it.</p>
