		<p>Futurlab has shared a new gameplay trailer for their spick-and-span sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in late 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2: Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rLMus-sx1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed off a bunch of the tools you’re using to tidy up Muckingham, from your standard powerwasher to a buffing thingy, new elevated platforms, isolated powerwashing jobs for pianos and rugs, and plenty more. It ended off with the new cat companion, Ulysses, who you can pet and take with you on every job. Cute!</p>
<p>But there’s more! PowerWash Simulator 2 will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham.</p>
<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>
