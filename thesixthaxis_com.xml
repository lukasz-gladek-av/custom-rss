		<p>Ubisoft has announced that the next update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will bring a third-person update, New Game + and more to the otherworldly action game when it arrives on… 5th December 2025.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, Ubisoft has announced a patch and given it a firm launch date four and a half months ahead of time. I’m not really complaining about this, and it’s great to know that there’s more updates and content coming to this game, but it’s a bit odd to be so specific so far in advance. The reason is that this forthcoming update will arrive shortly before the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in James Cameron’s blue person film franchise.</p>
<p>The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person, in a shift that’s not too dissimilar to the work needed for Capcom’s third-person mode for Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. It’s standard stuff.</p>

<p>“We’ve always envisioned Avatar Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players,” said Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive Entertainment. “This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.”</p>
<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has been well-supported by Ubisoft, with two story packs – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-dlc-launches-in-july/">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires – being released alongside quality of life updates that added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-40-fps-performance-mode-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">a 40FPS mode</a>, rebalanced combat and more.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</p>
