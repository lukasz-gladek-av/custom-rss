		<p>Dead By Daylight has been given a brand new update by Behaviour Interactive, bringing the game up to update 9.3.0. The update re-enables the Mindbreaker perk, but has disabled the Breakdown and Wicked perks. Another new major change applies to the Hook with a Resolve Bar being made visible to other Survivors while being hooked. There are also more balance changes, plus changes for both Killers and Survivors. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>
<h2>Dead By Daylight 9.3.0 Mid-Chapter update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Mindbreaker perk has been re-enabled.<wbr></li>
<li>The Breakdown and Wicked perks have been disabled.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Quality of Life</b><wbr></p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>The Resolve Bar is now visible to other Survivors while hooked.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To help bridge the information gap between players using voice chat and those who aren’t, we’ve added the Resolve Bar to the HUD. This will help Survivors determine if the Killer is camping and plan their next move accordingly.</i></p>
<p><wbr><b>Balance</b><wbr><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Anti-Facecamp meter now fills faster based on how long the Killer stays near the hook:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>0-10 seconds: 1x speed<wbr></li>
<li>10-20 seconds: 2x speed<wbr></li>
<li>&gt;20 seconds: 4x speed<wbr></li>
<li><i>Note: This multiplier only accumulates when the Killer is considered camping (the meter is gaining progress). The multiplier resets when the Survivor is unhooked.</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decreased the base fill rate of the Anti-Facecamp meter by roughly 50% to compensate.<wbr></li>
<li>Hooking a Survivor now applies a 7 second grace period to all hooked Survivors&nbsp;<i>(was only the last hooked Survivor)</i>.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To make the Anti-Facecamp mechanic fairer to both sides, we’ve reduced the base fill rate and added the time the Killer remains near the hook as a modifier. This gives Killers who are not camping more freedom to pass by a hook (particularly in cramped spaces like hallways) without worrying about the meter filling and giving the Survivor a free escape. This also means that Survivors who are being camped for extended periods gain the ability to unhook themselves slightly earlier.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Unhook Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survivors gain 10% Haste and Endurance for 15 seconds after being unhooked&nbsp;<i>(was 10)</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Decreased the time for crows to appear to 80/100/120 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 120/140/190)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Following the release of the updated AFK crow system, we increased the time it took to gain crows. This was much too generous, allowing for Survivors to avoid crows too easily. We’re dialing back the values a little bit to a middle ground between the original values and the live values.</i></p>


<p><b>The Shape</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slaughtering Strike’s camera controls are now identical to regular camera controls.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Skull Merchant</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the Drone Rotation speed to 105 degrees/second&nbsp;<i>(was 95 degrees/second).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the Hindered status effect from getting scanned to 10%&nbsp;<i>(was 8%).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Deploy Drone cooldown to 7 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 10 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Undetectable duration after deploying a Drone to 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 8 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the fast vault immunity to Scan Lines.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every 2.5 seconds spent standing underneath a Drone, the Survivor gains 1 Lock On&nbsp;<i>(was instant).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased Killer detection range for the Drone&nbsp;<i>(now only rises when colliding directly with The Skull Merchant)</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: The Skull Merchant has dropped fairly significantly in terms of kill rate and lethality. These buffs aim to make her Drones a bigger threat and bring her up a little bit. Additionally, we’ve decreased the cooldown to deploying drones, and consequently decreased the duration of Undetectable to keep some downtime between her Undetectable status effect. When standing underneath a Drone, Survivors would get instant Lock On, which felt like a bug whenever it happened. The gradual increase of Lock On will feel more natural and provide feedback to the Survivor that something bad is happening to them. Lastly, we reduced the Drone’s sensitivity to their mistress, to make sure they are always ready to scan Survivors during chases in tight spaces and don’t ascend unintentionally.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Original Pain (The Cenobite):</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a Survivor breaks free from a Possessed Chain, reveal their aura for 8 seconds&nbsp;<i>(rework).</i><wbr></p>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>

<li>Slipstreaming a Survivor inflicts the Hindered&nbsp;status effect for 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 3 seconds).</i><wbr></li>
<li>Inflicts the Deep Wound status effect if the Survivor is injured&nbsp;<i>(removed).</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Both of these add-ons were notorious for their ability to disable the Endurance status effect Survivors get when they are unhooked. These changes aim to remove this ability to bypass the protection post-unhook.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Conviction:</b><wbr></p>

<li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: With the above changes to hook improvements, we thought it was the right time to raise a few Score Events to encourage Killers to spread first hooks earlier in the match.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Pallet Density Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed all pallet tiles to evaluate and reduce the safety of pallet loops on MacMillan Estate, Asylum, The Red Forest, Yamaoka Estate, Haddonfield and Mount Ormond Resort.<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the spawn logic of certain structures (i.e. the main building in Disturbed Ward; the piers in Backwater Swamp) to better randomize items and balance the distance between windows and pallets. This also impacts The Red Forest<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the Crotus Prenn Asylum Realm, reducing the safety of the main building which could spawn near maze tiles and chain into other tiles.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: After collecting feedback from the community on the recent pallet density update, we made the above changes to address some of the most notable friction points.

</ul>
<p><b><u>Vanguard</u></b></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i>For too long, Vanguard’s role was to be a vessel for the squad’s healing perks. With these changes, we want to reinforce ranged/melee hybrid playstyle for him. But we are not entirely done with Vanguard changes. We would like to take a closer look at his ability.</i></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>????&nbsp;<u>Tenacity</u>: The perk has been reworked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Old:&nbsp;<i>“After killing 10 enemies within 5 seconds, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 40% for 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>New:<i>&nbsp;“After a Ranged kill Majoris-level or higher enemy, Diving Kick’s Damage increases by 130%. Cooldown 15 seconds.”</i></p>
<p>????&nbsp;<i><b>Change from PTS:</b>&nbsp;Fix interaction between Shock Wave perk and Tenacity caused by double damage scaling.</i></p>

<li><b>Extreme Challenge:&nbsp;</b>Increased Extremis enemies spawn cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay QoL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased netcode damage cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>????<i>&nbsp;This change is going to open a huge can of worms for gameplay balancing, but it has to be done. The game damage numbers should not be restricted by net code and should be accurate all of the time. We will be monitoring which builds and perks combinations will become problematic. It’s pretty clear that some damage buffs combinations from multiple sources are already insane (looking at you Blocking Power Fist). For now, have fun.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Sniper damage buff from Cloak Ability lasts a little bit longer to fully affect entire burst and full auto weapons.</li>
<li>Improved sound indication for unparriable attacks.</li>

<p>Set to release this week on 27th November, update 1.0.2 for Age of Imprisonment with bring multiple new challenges into the game for after you’ve cleared the main story. These appear as both Battle Challenges and Hyrule Challenges. Beating these will be how you unlock two new weapons, the Greatsword of Light and the Spear of the Upper Guard. There’s also some new attacks for you to learn to clear that screen of enemies.</p>


<p>Beyond that, update 1.0.2 does also bring a bunch of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Here’s the full (web browser translated and touched up) patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Update 1.0.2:</p>
<h2>Add new challenges and rewards</h2>
<div>
<h3>Adding a new challenge</h3>
<p>Multiple <strong>“Battle Challenges” </strong>and <strong>“Hyrule Challenges” </strong>will be added as elements after clearing the main story.<br>
New “dangerous species” such as Bokoblin and Sludgelikes have appeared. ” “Scra Attack” such as “Boko Slash”, which is activated using materials obtained from “Bokoblin (Dangerous Species)”, has been significantly improved compared to previous materials.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>New weapons added</h3>
<p>The “Greatsword of Light”, a special great sword blessed by Raura with the protection of the power of light, and the “Spear of the Upper Guard”, a spear given to the elite directly under King of Hyrule, will be added. These new weapons can be equipped with mysterious golems and warriors of various races.</p>
<p><em>You can get it by clearing the battles added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New dedicated sync strike</h3>
<p>A dedicated sync strike will be added to Zelda and Karamo. Zelda chases the boomerang thrown by Karamo with the power of time. If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and the attack will become powerful.</p>
<p><em>You can learn it by clearing the Hyrule Challenge added in this update.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fighting with Block Golems</h3>
<p>It will be possible to activate the sync strike with the block golem. Its powerful rotating attack kicks Zako and cuts the week point gauge of the strong enemy.</p>
<p><em>In addition to the battles added in this update, it can also be activated in existing battles where Block Golems appear.</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above, the following will be added as new battles.
<ul>
<li>“Battle with the serious Raura”</li>
<li>“Battle to get a lot of Pou”</li>
<li>“A peerless battle that can aim for more than 2000 KO”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Improvements</h2>
<h3>Action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed the special actions of the mysterious golem so that they can be saved for each weapon type</li>
<li>Added a warning sound before the end of the effect of the unique skills “Limit Break” and “Inexhaustible Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed to be able to select characters and weapons in “training room”</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the recovery amount when selecting “Special Carry-on Food” and “Spare Battery”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Departure preparation screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the “Friends” screen of preparation for departure, change to fly to “Tweet Challenge” with the [Y] button</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Map</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the tutorials displayed on the Hyrule map to the list</li>
<li>Visualize the area division on the ground on the Hyrule Map</li>
<li>Changed to display a preview of the area that can be recovered when the cursor is adjusted to the liberation battle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyrule Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the list of Hyrule Challenges, the items that can be cleared have been changed to yellow.</li>
<li>Adjust the display of the clear status of the Hyrule Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>Several problems have been fixed, including the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique skill “Golem Launch” is not affected by some special effects and enhancements.</li>
<li>The tweeting challenge “Defeat 〇〇 enemies with Zonaugear” is not counted even if the conditions are met by strong attacks and air battles in Zonaugear.</li>
<li>Even if the secret function “Autoguard with a certain probability and the enemy is electrocuted/freeze/flaming” is activated by Deggama’s attack, and even if the enemy is automatically guarded, it will not be in the state of attributes assumed by the enemy.</li>
<li>If you “Switch Characters” from the pose menu, the enhanced state may be released.</li>
<li>When you select “Retry” after a specific operation, the BGM may not sound after that.</li>
<li>Inability to proceed in Ososowaku communication occurs</li>
<li>When a communication disconnect occurs in Share communication, the attack will not hit a specific enemy.</li>
<li>When playing the screen split 2P, if you select “Retry” after a specific operation, you may return to “Hyrule Map”</li>
<li>In the screen split 2P play, when Matsuba and sync strike are activated, the camera rotation operation is reversed.</li>
<li>Some screen display problems</li>
</ul>
<p>We rather enjoyed Age of Imprisonment, as the latest in the Hyrule Warriors spin-off series, and as a canonical prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Dom said, “This is a playful and enjoyable piece of Legend of Zelda lore, and one that will be essential for fans of the series, but it doesn’t break the same ground as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, or even Age of Calamity.”</p>
