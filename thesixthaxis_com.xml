		<p>Nintendo is breaking out the Nintendo Treehouse Live for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 3rd and 4th April, bringing gameplay deep dives to the masses following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct stream taking place tomorrow, on 2nd April.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Treehouse Live broadcasts will start at 3PM UK time – 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 4PM CEST – and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica/streams">watch both of them on YouTube</a>. It’s not clear how long they will run for through the day, but as they will be running in tandem with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">live hands on events taking place in New York and Paris</a>, we can expect them to run for several hours with numerous different segments, expanding greatly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/">the 60-minute runtime confirmed for tomorrow’s main reveal stream</a>.</p>



<p>Both Treehouse Live broadcasts will feature hands-on gameplay of games for Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s quite likely that they will also be used to explore some of the unique features that Nintendo is introducing for the Switch 2 hardware – specifically, there’s the long-rumoured mouse functionality for the Joy-Con, and a mysterious C button on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Of course, we already know one game that will be featured here, as one of the most exciting things from the January <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>. We might also see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer/">Metroid Prime 4</a> reemerge after its latest trailer from last week’s Nintendo Direct, if it’s to be a cross-gen release.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Nintendo has managed to keep a lid on many of the games and surprises that await in tomorrow’s show. Obviously, stay tuned for all the announcements coming down the large green pipe tomorrow afternoon, and keep eyes peeled for all the live hands on impressions to emerge from those public shows in New York and Paris. We’re pretty princess peachy keen to see how big a step up the Switch 2 is!</p>
