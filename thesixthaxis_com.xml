		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>
