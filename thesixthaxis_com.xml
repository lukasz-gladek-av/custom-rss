		<p>Ubisoft has announced a round of layoffs, cutting 185 jobs from across its European studios, and closing one studio down completely.</p>
<p>UK-based Ubisoft Leamington is being shut down, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">Eurogamer reporting</a> that almost all of its 50 team members are being laid off. Beyond that, there’s also “targeted restructuring” that will affect Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p>


<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-cuts-185-jobs-in-a-bid-to-prioritise-projects-and-reduce-costs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a Ubisoft spokesperson said:</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition.</p>

<p>The news comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">Ubisoft announced the closure of XDefiant</a>, laying off team members from San Francisco, Sydeny and Osaka.</p>
<p>There’s no end in sight, it seems, for the struggles being faced across the industry. Earlier this month a Transformers game was cancelled, affecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/transformers-reactivate-has-been-cancelled-staff-to-be-laid-off/">Splash Damage</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">People Can Fly also laid off 120 in December</a> after a project cancellation.</p>
<p>As always, our thoughts are with those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they can find new work soon.</p>

		<p>Rockfish has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>: Wrath of the Ancients, a major expansion to their space adventure that adds a new post-game story, more star systems, side quests and more when it launches for PlayStation, Xbox and PC this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | Wrath of the Ancients — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jij3a23hx3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Apparently the community has bugged Rockfish about the Aethon system long enough – to be fair, Rockfish were the ones teasing it – but Aethon will be just one star system within this expansion, in which you’ll explore several star systems from the Okkar civilization.</p>
<p>But who are the Okkar? Well, they’re an emerging faction appearing just as attacks using weapons from the Ancients have sparked a fresh conflict in Cluster 34, using these attacks ostensibly by the Ancients as justification for their own possible hostilities. You and your crew have to head to the Okkar Homeworlds to try and defuse the situation.</p>
<p>This expansion will push the game’s lore ahead, but it will also bring new twists to the combat. You’ll be able to snag an Okkar Wraith ship and use it’s various new abilities against challenging new enemies. Existing ships will also be compatible with the new weapons and gear, including new upgradable Okkar equipment – more details on those at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Everspace 2 was a big change from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/18/everspace-stellar-edition-review/">the original game</a>. That had been a roguelike space adventure, but the sequel morphed into a more traditional narrative led space shooter. We loved the change, with Ade saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/27/everspace-2-review/">Everspace 2 review</a>, “I started Everspace 2 deeply unsure about a space looter shooter. Tens of hours later I don’t want to play anything else. Everspace 2 is a towering achievement of space-based thrills and spills. It absolutely deserves your attention.”</p>
