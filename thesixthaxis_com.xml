		<p>Star Wars Zero Company has been revealed by EA, which is a brand new single player turn based tactics game being developed by BitReactor and Respawn. There is not much detail yet as EA has stated that the full reveal will be coming on April 19th during Star Wars Celebration. The game has been rumoured for a while, with leaks suggesting Star Wars Zero Company will play like X-Com games.</p>



<p>Going by the artwork this looks like Clone Wars era Star Wars with Zero Company being a mix of characters including a Jedi, bounty hunter, clone trooper, droid, and rogue. What we donâ€™t know yet is if the timeline of Zero Company will explore the entirety of the era from up to the conclusion of Order 66, or whether it will stop short of that defining event.</p>
<p>We will have to wait until April 19th to get a proper look at Star Wars Zero Company, and learn more about the actual story of the game.</p>
