		<p>Chief Rebel has announced a small patch for its multiplayer online PvE dungeon game Fellowship, which addresses some issues raised in a previous patch and introduces some rebalances and fixes. The game will be down while the patch is applied. Fellowship is currently in early access on Steam, which the development team expect to last for around six months. The early access version of Fellowship has nine heroes to choose from and a selection of dungeons to fight through.</p>
