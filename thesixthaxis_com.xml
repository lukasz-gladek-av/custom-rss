		<p>Ubisoft has released details about Anno 117: Pax Romana’s multiplayer modes, confirming that players can face off against each other, work together, and even play the game’s campaign together. Ubisoft has also stated mods will be usable in multiplayer, though those will require all players to have the same mods installed so they work.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana Preview – Pleasing Plebians &amp; Trading Triremes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xOhonMdJCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s PvP mode allows up to four players to face off against each other to grab the best locations, shore up alliances, and go to war. In co-op, players play as the same governor to share responsibilities and you will have to work together to keep things running smoothly, lest you want your faction to fall to outside forces. Third, you can mix PvP and co-op. You can have four teams of four, where each team is a governor, face off against each other. Multiplayer will be invite only so you will need to have people on your friends list if you want to play with them. Another new addition is co-op live save games, where players can continue co-op games by themselves and re-invite friends to join later. Anno 117: Pax Romana will also feature cross-play. When DLC is released, all players will need to own it if they want to use in multiplayer, there will be a day and night cycle, and the game .does not feature text or voice chat functionality.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is due to be released on November 13th for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>

		<p>Chucklefish and co-developer Robotality have announced that the magical life simulator has been delayed into 2026, so it will not be released this year as planned. However, it is not all bad news as an interactive map for the game’s location Mossport. You can check out an image of it below, or click through to the official website to check out the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive Witchbrook map</a>.</p>



<p>Every colourful area on the Witchbrook map is a playable area, with locations including Shadhollow Forest, Parasol Sands, Mossport High Street, the Student Village, Shadbrook Cottage and, of course, Witchbrook College. In a blog post, Chucklefish stated what would come next in the Witchbrook development journey saying, <em>“The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them. We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in Witchbrook, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customisation arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another&nbsp;<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWBOracle">The Witchbrook Oracle</a> already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.”</em></p>
<p>Witchbrook is set to release for PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.</p>
