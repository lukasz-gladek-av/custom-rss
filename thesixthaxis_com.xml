		<p>Who needs other people, eh? Sure they’re good for companionship, love and affection – and I suppose for a more effective Helldivers squad – but really, why not replace all that with a good old single player game? One that you can play on your own, whenever you like, and which won’t rely on anything other than your investment in it. OK, maybe I’m being flippant, but single player remains the bedrock of gaming, and after a number of years in the live service wilderness, they’re firmly at the forefront once more. 2024 has been a brilliant year for solo experiences, but one ran, bounced and boinged just that little bit harder than everyone else.</p>

<p>To call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> a love letter to gaming is to diminish its own creativity. Still, it is a missive filled with warmth and joy, not just for the PlayStation family and its beloved characters, but to the bountiful platforming abandon that’s normally a portly plumber’s remit. Just like Nintendo’s finest, Astro Bot is a repeated shot of delight that you will continue to down until you can’t possibly take any more, before finding room for just a little more.</p>
<p>Astro and his pals’ PS5-shaped spaceship is wrecked by some no-good aliens, leaving them strewn and stranded throughout the universe. Fortunately, our plucky hero sets out to rescue them within moments, leading to hour upon hour of platforming perfection.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> was a proof of concept to show off the PS5’s different abilities, Astro Bot takes that creativity and turns the dial way up, delivering you to tropical locales, sandy deserts and freezing tundras, where you fend off all manner of cute but deadly foes while encountering a new gameplay mechanic around every turn. It’s perky, cute and practically perfect in every way, and while you can share in its joy with other players, this is a classic singleplayer affair, making it a deserving winner of this year’s award.</p>

<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Atlus is renowned for the likes of Persona. When fourteen of the creative minds behind Persona left P-Studio to set up Studio Zero, it was obvious that whatever they made would be liquid gold. The first game they released is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>While Studio Zero is tasked with developing original IP and content unrelated to Persona, it’s fair to call their work Persona-like. Not only are there systems and mechanics that carry over, from the progression of time to the friendship simulator, and even the basics of combat, but there are some tremendous Easter Eggs that even the least eagle-eyed fans will spot.</p>
<p>Gameplay boils down to two things: a dungeon-crawling turn-based action RPG and a time management sim. The interplay between the two is very well built, offering huge flexibility in how you play the game. If you’re looking for a game you can easily sink 150 hours into, without getting bored of gameplay, you won’t go far wrong with Metaphor!</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Solitaire is basically&nbsp;<em>the</em> single player card game, and Balatro takes a healthy dose of influence from Solitaire in with its blend of Poker hands and an overarching roguelike structure. There’s no story here (outside of a slightly snarky Joker card commenting on your failure), just a pure, unadulterated tumble down a rabbit hole of Poker hands, modifiers and ever-growing scores to overcome.</p>

		<p>If 2024 has shown us anything, it’s that the multiplayer live service boom is well and truly over. Despite being objectively fun to play and super polished, games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">Suicide Squad</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> failed to make a splash – the latter being dead on arrival in one of the biggest gaming flops ever. It casts a grim shadow over the wider multiplayer genre, proving that there’s really only room for a handful of majorly successful online games at one time.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there weren’t any great multiplayer games in 2024, though. While legions of gamers are still glued to Fortnite, Warzone, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends, there have been some hot new contenders, one of them arriving at the start of the year…</p>

<p>Playing big, bombastic shooters with friends is always more fun, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> is the kind of game to remind you that these can also be silly and just funny as well. It takes the satire and violence of Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and adds in a bit of player-led workplace comedy. Sure, it’s fun to call in a huge orbital barrage or minefield on a bug’s nest, but it’s <em>funny</em> to do that five seconds after your team has just rushed in and “forget” to call it out in time.</p>
<p>Arrowhead has always made fun and silly co-op games where the fire is always friendly, and explosions are always excessive, but the jump from the top-down action of the original to a third person view with more realistic graphics just managed to capture the attention of gamers at large. Add to that an engaging meta layer to the game, actively engaging with the community through highs and lows of balance and gameplay changes, and the recent reveal of a new enemy faction, and this is easily the best multiplayer game of the year.</p>

<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Through the last generation, it’s felt as though couldn’t so much as blink without a new Warhammer 40,000 game being announced, resulting in a never-ending slew of PC and mobile titles. With 40K having witnessed a huge spike in popularity over the past few years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> arrived at the perfect time, with Boltgun and Chainsword in-hand.</p>
<p>What made the sequel such a strong offering was its pairing of a solid campaign with a whole suite of multiplayer options, allowing friends to play through the story together, duke it out in PvP, or run a gauntlet of missions designed for co-op play. There’s a lot of shared DNA with Saber Interactive’s brilliant World War Z video game, enhanced with dynamic melee combat and a heavily expanded arsenal of weaponry plucked from the 41st millennium.</p>
<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Last year’s Call of Duty wasn’t the flawless end to Infinity Ward’s Modern Warfare trilogy fans had hoped for: it was by no means poor but felt more like a DLC expansion as opposed to a full-blown sequel. Going into 2025, it seemed as though the next Call of Duty would be even further entrenched in a lack of innovation and growing player fatigue. We were wrong to doubt Treyarch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> is the full package: the best CoD campaign in many years, rewardingly layered Zombies co-op, and punchy, tactical online play. On paper it’s a subtle change yet the inclusion of “omnidirectional” player movement adds a silky smoothness that elevates each part of Treyarch’s trifecta. It’s hard to imagine this feature being dropped in future instalments.</p>
