		<p>The Game Bakers have announced a new release date for their mountain climbing game Cairn, which was delayed back in September as the team needed more time. The new release date for Cairn is January 29th, when it will be released for PC and PS5. Ahead of the full release, you can play the Cairn demo on Steam and PS5 to get an idea of what to expect on your climb of Kami.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Game Bakers has also revealed the details of the Deluxe Edition, along with pricing for the different versions of the game. The Cairn Deluxe Edition will include a Kami travel book, wallpapers, and three keepsakes that can be added to main character Aava’s rucksack. Both versions will have a 10% launch discount with the standard edition priced at $26.99/26.99€ / £22.99 / JP¥3060 / CN¥98 and the Deluxe Edition priced at $34.20/ 34.20€ / £28.60 / JP¥3924 / CN¥129.</p>
<p>In Cairn, players climb the mountain Kami as explorer Aava. On this journey, Aava will find traces of past climbs, historical artefacts that tell the story of the mountain, and run into other climbers who are on their own journeys. Cairn is a realistic climbing simulator where you will need to guide Aava to suitable holds for her hands and feet, while also maintaining balance so she does not fall off of Mount Kami.</p>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun developer Auroch Digital has announced its next FPS, and you will be shooting at aliens but not in the Warhammer universe. This time, Auroch Digital has turned its attention to Starship Troopers announcing Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War, which is a single player retro styled FPS where players will shoot a lot of bugs to do their part.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFb2E7IzXKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! will see the return of General Jonny Rico, with Casper Van Dien reprising his role, along with new character Major Samantha “Sammy” Dietz. In the game’s campaign players will have access to over 30 weapons to use against the bugs as the war across the galaxy rages on.</p>
<p>While a release date has not be confirmed yet, Auroch Digital is aiming for an early 2026 window. Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! is due to be released for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>Well, I don’t think anyone was expecting a new Carmageddon game to be announced, and yet 34BigThings has revealed Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. The new Carmageddon game is a roguelite racer where vehicular combat is central to every event. Players will have a number of different vehicle bodies and weapon types to use to build their own deadly racer. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is also taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

		<p>A big cinematic story trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, revealing some of the alien races that you’ll battle and a surprise Space Marine team-up in the fight for the future of the planet Kronus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - Story Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja6IOle_Thg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The planet Kronus was the setting for the second DLC campaign for the original Dawn of War game, and this leads us back to battling some familiar foes. Co-written by Black Library author John French, the story sees Kronus beset by an Ork infestation, now with two rival Ork Warbosses vying for power, while the Necrons are emerging from their tombs beneath the surface, as well as with an invasion fleet appearing above.</p>
<p>That’s a lot for a Space Marine Chapter to deal with, as formidable as they all are, so it’s a good thing that they’ll be getting a hand. The Adeptus Mechanicus will feature in the game, and the Dark Angels are also turning to to ally themselves with the Blood Ravens. You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. They’ve also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>

<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/metroid-prime-4-phenoros-boss-guide-lava-volcano-flare-pool/</link>
            <guid>1374061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Lying deep in Metroid Prime 4’s volcano facility of the Flare Pool region is the huge boss Phenoros, yet another creature native to Viewros that has been corrupted by a Metroid and now serves as a major threat to Samus and her mission.</p>
<p>There’s a few stages to this battle, which can be quite a drawn out one if you don’t spot the key moments and what you need to do in order to succeed. Here’s a breakdown of the stages to the boss battle and how best to overcome them.</p>
<p>Obviously there are some <strong>progression spoilers</strong> within this guide, so at this point, <strong>stop reading if you aren’t currently struggling to beat Phenoros!</strong></p>


<p>OK, so… with that out of the way, let’s get on with the guide!</p>
<h3>Phenoros on the lava lake</h3>
<p>The first section of the Phenoros battle has Samus on the Vi-O-La IC, chasing after Phenoros as it swims around a huge lake of lava. It doesn’t really try to attack you during this phase, but can swim a little erratically, throwing up choppy lava flows that slow you down and balls of magma. Scanning Phenoros and look at it for visual clues reveals a string of weak spots on the underside of its snake-like body.</p>


<p>The goal during this section is to use the Vi-O-La disc attack to hit all of these weak spots, and the best way to do this is to try to drive alongside Phenoros and quickly target multiples as its body dips in and out of the lava. Once all of them have been hit, it’s on to the next stage!</p>
<h3>Phenoros showdown</h3>
<p>Now you’ve made Phenoros really angry! Samus is stuck on a small chunk of its body while its head towers over her. The aim here is to hit between one and four blue weakspots on Phenoros’ head and trigger a damage phase where you blast its tongue with as many heavy attacks as you possibly can! Ice Beam attacks can quickly take out chunks of its health during this.</p>

<p>Hitting the weak spots can be tricky. Phenoros’ head waves around a lot and the weakspots are on the side of its head. You need to either lock on and manually adjust your aim to hit them, or Switch 2 players might feel better using mouse mode.</p>
<p>During this section, Phenoros has a few key attacks to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Flame Breath</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros rears back and then unleashed a beam of flaming energy that it sweeps from one side of the semi-circle island to the other. You can jump over this, but I found it easiest to just morph ball and wait until it passes over.<br>
<strong>Bite</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros pulls back from the island before rushing forward to grab Samus. You need to time a dodge move to evade this, or be caught in Phenoros’ mouth and mash A to escape.<br>
<strong>Magma Balls</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros spits out five slow-moving magma balls that home towards you. Shoot them in time and you’ll get some ammo and health top ups.</p>

<h3>Phenoros below half health</h3>
<p>Once you’ve got Phenoros below half health, it transforms and opens up two large head flaps, revealing four new weak spots. The goal is the same: blast those weak spots to put Phenoros into a dazed state and then blast its tongue with damage.</p>
<p>During this, Phenoros has all its previous attack, but a little bit faster and souped up –&nbsp;the flame breath is a double sweep. In addition there is one new attack:</p>
<p><strong>Ear Guns</strong> –&nbsp;From the remaining weak spots, Phenoros shoots blasts of energy at you. Keep strafing to avoid taking damage.</p>

<h3>Phenoros Finisher</h3>
<p>With Phenoros down to its last chunk of health, it will be incapacitated, floating on the surface, mouth wide open. This is the time to strike the final blow. You can’t head into its body yourself, but using a guided charged beam shot – charge up a standard beam shot while in the scanner view – you can home in on its core and take it down!</p>

<p>If you don’t do this in time, Phenoros will recover and return to the previous stage with a bit more health, needing to be downed once more.</p>
<p>Well done, you’ve defeated Phenoros! And now? Well, it’s time to grab a new ability and get the heck outta here!</p>
