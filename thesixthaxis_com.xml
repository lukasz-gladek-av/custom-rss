<p>When Disney Illusion Island releases for all of these platforms, new free content will be added in the form of Cave Adventuring Scavenger Hunt, which will allow players to unlock permanent upgrades. Disney Illusion Island will support four player co-op allowing the whole cast of characters to be playable at the same time, where players will swim, jump, and run through the different levels. Of course, you can also play the game solo too and you can choose who to play as with those options being Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.</p>
<p>The setting of Disney Illusion Island is the mysterious island of Monoth, which is split into three different biomes. Those areas are the leafy and overgrown Pavonia, the puzzling structures of Gizmopolis and the space styled oceans of Astrono. . All of the cutscenes are fully voiced and brand new characters will be introduced through the game.</p>
