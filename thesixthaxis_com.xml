		<p>Straight4 Studios and Giants Software have lifted the lid on Project Motor Racing’s ranked online multiplayer mode, detailing how players will compete against each other in different classes and events throughout their online journey. Additionally, six new car brand partners have been confirmed to be in the game with those being Acura, Chevrolet, Mazda, Mercedes-AMG, Nissan, and Toyota. Plus, there is news of a new track with Sebring International Raceway being added to the track roster as well.</p>

<p>In Project Motor Racing’s online ranked multiplayer the first thing you are going to need is a license to drive. This license does not carry over across different vehicle classes, since different car classes handle differently. Instead, for each class you will earn your license and that will give an initial score from 0-100, based on race cleanliness and placement. This score will place players with other racers of a similar skill level and the score will fluctuate depending on race. Each week, your two best race scores will contribute to a championship standing which is determined by finishing position and the ratings of the people that were raced. Hitting certain milestones will unlock access to special championships, while endurance races will only be available to racers with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>

<p>Project Motor Racing is due to be released on November 25th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
