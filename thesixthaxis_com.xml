		<p>There’s a lot you can say about Ubisoft’s recent decisions, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-major-reorganisation-brings-layoffs-game-cancellations-including-sands-of-time-remake-new-creative-houses/">cancelling games</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-close-a-studio-weeks-after-the-workers-vote-to-unionise/">closing studios </a>they have been making big changes, none of which seem to have affected their share price, which has tumbled over 95% over ten years.</p>
<p>But fret not, they have a new release, one that was announced during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2682515870?t=0h0m1s">Twitch stream</a> that no one appears to have watched.&nbsp;Tom Clancy’s The Division – Definitive Edition is ready for you to download from the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox Store </a>and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-CUSA01262_00-THEDIVISIONDE000">PlayStation Store</a> and includes every single piece of DLC for the ten-year-old game at the bargain price of $49.99/£44.99</p>


<p>So to be clear, this is the first The Division game on PS4/XB1, an online-only multiplayer game that has a player count of just over *checks notes* 700<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/365590/charts/"> combatants on Steam&nbsp;</a>as of the time of writing. The base game has recently been on sale for $4.49. The game is so old that it doesn’t even have cross-play, but PS5 players did get a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/the-division-yes-the-first-one-gets-a-ps5-update/">60fps mode back in December.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At this point I would post the trailer for the Definitive Edition, but it doesn’t exist, so I’m sticking to my standard replacement of kittens.</p>

<p>“Get the complete The Division experience in this Definitive Edition! The base game, all three Season Pass expansions, and multiple cosmetic packs await you,” its description reads on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox store</a>. “The Definitive Edition also includes gear sets, weapon skins, and customization options, everything you need to stand out as an elite agent.”</p>

<p>We gave The Division a score of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/03/14/tom-clancys-the-division-review/">8/10 back in 2016 .&nbsp;</a>“At its core, it marries solid cover-based shooting with a loot heavy RPG and an enticingly beautiful setting, but it really comes together when you can team up with friends and take on enemies, whether rebellious AI factions or other agents in the fraught and tense Dark Zone. There are a few foibles, but it’s a game that can easily draw you in and have you playing for hours on end,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>The third game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> was cancelled by Ubisoft last year, with the publisher saying they would focus on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>XDefiant&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">shut down eight months later.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/square-enixs-killer-inn-hits-early-access-soon-with-a-free-stay-weekend-this-week/</link>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that their social deduction multiplayer game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killer-inn">Killer Inn</a> will launch into Steam Early Access on 12th February, with a ‘Free Stay Weekend’ trial and server test coming this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="KILLER INN | Steam???? Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDtHM343udQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The muder mystery multiplayer m… game will be playable from 10PM GMT on Friday 6th February through to 9:59PM GMT on Monday 9th February on Steam. Everyone that participates in this trial, and that has played a previous closed beta test will receive a special weapon skin and nameplay banner for the full game.</p>
<p>With The Traitors a global TV sensation that adapts the already popular social deduction games of Werewolves and Blood on the Clocktower, Killer Inn could be a hit for those looking for a similar tone of game. But there’s a big injection of extra action to this particular game.</p>
<p>Players are divided into Wolves and Lambs, with the Wolves trying to kill all of the Lambs, while the Lambs try to gather clues and figure out the Wolves. As players are murdered, clues are left behind that give hints as to who the killer was, helping the Lambs narrow down who the Wolves are. When the Lambs are sure of their opponents, they can try to take them down in armed third person shooter combat, ganging up to take on their rivals with whoever they think are allies.</p>

<p>The game will feature 27 playable characters to unlock whether through play or with an optional in-game purchase, each with two unique abilities. The price during Early Access will be a rather modest £8, while the bundle with two extra playable characters, skins and advanced rule editing feature for custom lobbies comes in at £24 for the first two weeks, thanks to a 10% discount.</p>
