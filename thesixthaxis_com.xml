		<p>Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios are arguably the masters of co-op action, and their latest, Split Fiction, is looking like something pretty special. Excitingly, we’re now barely six weeks away from its launch, and just to make sure we keep up that level of excitement, the team have dropped a brand new trailer, showing off more of the co-op action, and some of the extremely varied gameplay styles we’re going to get to enjoy together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game centres on Mio and Zoe – named for Fares’ daughters – each of which are authors of different genres of fiction. Drawn into their own works, the levels and overarching story are half science fiction and half fantasy, making this an exciting amalgam of the two.</p>
<p>This latest trailer shows off more of the levels, with the first centring on gravity, set within a futuristic cyberpunk city. There’s giant mechs to fight, and some cool gravity tethering action here, as well as some Ghostrunner-esque motorbike sections that look absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>Next up, we get to see a fantasy level, with the two characters gaining the ability to shapeshift into different creatures, becoming a huge ape-like monster, or a fast-moving water-dweller, while you collaborate to make it to the end of the level. If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> you’ll have an understanding of the wild and varied types of gameplay we’re likely to come across, and this only cements our excitement. It’s little surprise that the game made it into the top ten of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Most Wanted for 2025</a>.</p>

<p>As the trailer closes out, Fares shows off some of the additional content that’s going to be available here, with side quest portals opening up at various points to take you into a new world, with another new gameplay style. While you won’t have to play these to advance the story, it looks like you won’t want to miss out on it.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will launch on March 6, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app. Players can also invite a friend to play with them for free on any platform (Crossplay on PS, Xbox &amp; PC) with the Friend’s Pass.</p>
