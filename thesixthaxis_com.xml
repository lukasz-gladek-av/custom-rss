		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2</a> will be an “action RPG”, Remedy Entertainment has stated, but before you use telekinesis to throw things at the wall, they actually define the first game as a “focused action-adventure RPG” as well. I think that’s a technobabble way of saying “Metroidvania” without invoking intergalactic bounty hunters and vampire hunters.</p>
<p>The problem is that as soon as that’s reduced down to “action RPG” for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a">a BlueSky post</a>, it actually then invokes a very different mental image filled with Witchers and Viking assassins, where numbers pop off enemies as you fight them. Strictly speaking, there is an RPG character progression system as you gain abilities and then empower them, and there’s definitely action and a kind of adventuring, but these particular terms are now so broad as to be meaningless.</p>


<p>The thing is that “action RPG” is just being used as shorthand when filling out a table. Here’s a slide, alongside which CFO Santtu Kallionpää describes Control 2 as being in the “action-adventure role playing genre” –<a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/"> here at the 57 minute mark</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when describing the main franchises, they’re shown as:</p>


<p>The most important thing to know is that&nbsp;Control 2 will be like Control. Less important is to define what Control was, but if I had to, I’d call it a third person shooter Metroidvania.</p>
<p>Giving a broad presentation for Capital Markets Day, Remedy gave an update on the overarching business, how their games have performed, the studio’s continuing ethos and an small insight into their future plans.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 has now sold 1.8 million copies, for example, while Control has now passed 4.5 million sold (though there’s 19 million players, thanks to PS Plus, Game Pass and other promotions. Both a key pillars in a connected Remedy universe, and alongside FBC Firebreak, provide three contrasting but complimentary genres.</p>
<p>Control, as we’ve already covered, is a Metroidvania that you could technically call a focused action-adventure RPG. Alongside that we have Alan Wake as a survival horror – this has morphed somewhat from the original game to Alan Wake 2, but the descriptor is now perfect and makes sense. Lastly there’s FBC Firebreak, which “session-based co-op shooter” describes pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>Those are the three paths for Remedy’s self-publishing efforts, all using their in-house Northlight engine, which they see to be a real strength and distinguishing factor over adopting Unreal. The final avenue not really discussed is the Max Payne remake project, which is being kept separate as it will be published by Rockstar.</p>
<p>It was also announced that Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock previously-released content for all players, and Control Ultimate Edition will arrive for Mac on 12th February 2025.</p>

		<p>If there’s one thing we know and love Media Molecule for, it’s pushing creativity and experimentation within its game design. The studio burst onto the scene with PS3 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>, before taking the concept of in-game creation to new heights with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dreams">Dreams</a>, but nestled between those projects was something a little smaller, something that you could fit in your pocket. I am, of course, talking about the paper-folded platforming adventure of Tearaway.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tearaway - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0oxBviRGlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tearaway is certainly a more conventional game that the rest of what Media Molecule has made. Sure, LittleBigPlanet had its Mm created story and was a side-scrolling platformer, but those were an introduction to the potential that the level-creation tools could offer, and had the unique quirk of multiple planes. By contrast, Tearaway is a rather traditional 3D platformer.</p>


<p>But that meant that the team could go all-in with using the PS Vita’s additional features, perhaps most distinctively the rear touchpad. This was used for all sorts of gameplay mechanics, from piercing through the game world to move platforms and flick away enemies, to drumming on platforms to help Iota/Atoi jump higher to reach higher locations in the world. The touchscreen, meanwhile, is used for the game’s crafting where you can trace designs on pieces of paper that are then cut out, as well as place accessories on different characters.</p>


<p>The PS Vita’s camera has a central part to Tearaway too, as your face is in the game’s sun, basically turning you into the baby from Teletubbies. You are watching over the world at all times. The camera also brings parts of the world back to life where the Scraps, the enemies, have stripped all colour from different items and characters. Take a photo of them and you will bring back their features. Finally, the microphone lets you record little messages and sound effects, when prompted, to add your voice to Iota/Atoi’s world.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re all gimmicks, but they tie in with the overall charm and whimsy of the story that the game is telling, bringing you into the game and casting you as a You.</p>
<p>This part is as integral to Tearaway’s plot as Iota/Atoi’s journey in, because these characters are letters that are on a quest to deliver themselves to you. Not that they know that at first, and in fact are properly terrified when your face suddenly appears in the Sun so try to hide. It is only when they speak to other characters that they realise that you are an ally.</p>

<p>11 years on from its initial release. Tearaway’s level designs really hold up, as do the little side characters that act as guides and quest givers. The artistic vision of the development team took the main character from woods to labs, harbour towns to tears in reality. Each location is unique, and the way each location is fully made to look like it is made from paper really makes Tearaway stand out even now. The Scraps are fun designed enemies too, even if they do appear to be cardboard boxes with legs or wings. They are a danger to Iota/Atoi but they can be easily defeated with your help.</p>
<p>For me, Tearaway is also a window back to an era where Sony really let its developers explore fun and exciting ideas in its smaller games, while still investing well in its triple AAA space. The game space has changed in the last decade, and the Sony that released the PS Vita has become the Sony that’s had the success of the PS4 and PS5, the hits of Horizon, God of War and Spider-Man. There’s the odd PlayStation Studios game that stands out in this quirky manner, most recently Astro Bot, but it feels like we’re unlikely to see a new Tearaway game or a similarly offbeat effort any time soon, and that’s a real shame.</p>
