<p>In Odin: Valhalla Rising, players will be able to explore various realms based upon Norse mythology including Midgaard and Jotunheim as one of four classes. Those classes are Warrior, Sorceress, Priest, and Rogue. Game modes include the 30v30 Valhalla mode, co-op battles, dungeons, and raids. Kakao Games will be adding features further down the line, including a Guild Wars mode. The story of Odin: Valhalla Rising is based upon Ragnarok, with Odin trying to avoid it. He does this by exiling Loki, who doesnâ€™t take this well so awakens different creatures that have been laying dormant in the void of Ginnungagap.</p>
