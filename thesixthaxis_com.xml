<h2>Highguard 1.0.4 update patch notes</h2>

<p><i>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English. Properly localized settings will be prepared for a future patch.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.<wbr></li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.<wbr></li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.<wbr></li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new “View Distance Quality” setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials<wbr></li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration<wbr></li>
<li>Bloom<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</i><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.&nbsp;<i>More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</i><wbr></li>
<li>Players can now select&nbsp;<i>Off</i>&nbsp;to disable Global Illumination entirely.<wbr></li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Crash and Bug Fixes</b><wbr></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.<wbr></li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90%, significantly improving stability.<wbr></li>
<li>Friend status is fixed – players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90% crash reduction.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we haven’t got a full review for Highguard yet, Dom gave some early impressions saying, <em>“Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>
