			<p>It’s Monster Hunter mania at this year’s Tokyo Game Show, with Capcom giving over a huge amount of floorspace to every version of Monster Hunter currently out there, from the mainline Wilds and crossover events in Final Fantasy XIV, through to the upcoming mobile title <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a>. The next big release for the franchise, though, is Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p>

<p>The third entry in the turn-based RPG spin-off turns monsters, or Monsties, into rideable pals, fusing Pokémon-style collecting with a slower-paced take on Monster Hunter’s inimitable style and genre-defining combat. It’s a spin-off that’s earned plenty of accolades, and with Stories 3 it looks as though Capcom have created the best entry yet.</p>


<p>So much of the game’s appeal stems from its visuals. The anime-inspired art direction is effortlessly appealing, and here it feels closer than ever to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a>. That’s no bad thing, and when it’s combined with the unique armour designs and iconic creatures of the Monster Hunter universe, you’ve got one of the best-looking anime-style games in recent memory.</p>


<p>As a JRPG, there’s a far greater focus on storytelling than you’ll find in the mainline series, and that means more conversation, more world-building, and more characterisation. Luckily for us, we got to experience a good portion of the game during our hands-on at TGS. You’re Captain Leo, a prince of the kingdom who’s sworn to lead a group known as the Raiders. Alongside Simon, rookie Thea and Felyne pal Rudy, you set out to find the truth in a foreboding prophecy, in a world where various species are going extinct, and the kingdom is on the brink of war.</p>
<p>We got to play the demo build on Switch 2 in handheld mode, and I was initially concerned whether Capcom had been able to iron out the performance issues that plagued Monster Hunter Stories 2 on the original Switch. Thankfully, it seems that frame rate issues have been hunted into extinction, though I think it’s running at a more modest 30fps rather than the PS5’s 60fps. Still, for a turn-based game, that makes very little difference, and the exploration felt smooth and issue-free. Oddly, the only place where I thought I caught a couple of stutters was during cutscenes, but with these outside gameplay, and kinks should be ironed out before launch in March next year.</p>
<p>Three games in, the fundamental combat system remains in place, with you and your Monstie fighting alongside a companion and their creature. There’s three different types of basic attack, with Power, Technical and Speed attacks each holding sway over one other. If you end up in a head-to-head and you’ve picked the more powerful attack, then you’ll cause extra damage, and avoid taking any yourself, though if you get it wrong, you’ll be punished accordingly. It promotes learning each monster’s attacks and weaknesses, and it’s a clever way to bring across a facet of the mainline games.</p>

<p>It doesn’t stop there. As you fight, you build up Kinship with your Monstie. You do that just by fighting alongside each other, but you can amp it up with Double Attacks, where you and your monster have chosen the same type of attack. Once you’ve charged your Kinship, you can leap onto your monster pal and then unleash a Kinship attack that’s both graphically rewarding and massively damaging. Fundamentally, that’s the core loop of battle.</p>
<p>The demo featured a small selection of easily recognisable monsters, starting with the fodder of Velociprey, before increasing the difficulty with the Velocidrome and a Paolumu. Through the demo you saw the importance of focusing on attack types, and working with your Monstie in order to dish out the most damage.</p>
<p>The close of the demo showcased the final form of that, with you facing off against a Feral Chatacabra. Feral creatures have been afflicted by some kind of growth – haven’t they always? – and you have to think through which part of the animal to attack, and when.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong time and the wrong part results in a vicious counterattack, so you have to bide your time before trying to remove the growth from its back. In the meantime, it covers its forearms in a different substance, and if you then aim for those limbs, you can topple it over, giving you and your teammate the chance to unleash a Synchro Rush, once again hammering it and its health bar.</p>
<p>Whether the additions to the turn-based combat make all that much difference remains to be seen, and in some ways, it’s just kicking the can a little further down the road. I do hope that the overall difficulty is a little higher than the previous games, or that there’s the option to make it more challenging from the off, so that veterans and turn-based fans can really get the most out of it. That said, it does exactly what you want, which is give you more Monster Hunter Stories.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is the obvious next step for the series. That’s taking the graphics and the turn-based action up a notch, while expanding the world of Monster Hunter into newfound territory. The previous two games have given fans a totally different take on the mythology and magic of the series’ iconic creatures, and on early impressions alone, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection looks as though it’s going to carry on that tradition.</p>

		<p>It’s been a mixed year for Monster Hunter. Wilds released to much furore, hardly surprising when it’s the most visually impressive, mechanically complete, and approachable entry in the series to date, but Capcom have really struggled to nail down the game’s performance on PC, and players soon realised that with the lowered difficulty and small-scale updates, it was a shorter-lived game. But maybe Monster Hunter Outlanders can be the antidote?</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Outlanders Tokyo Game Show 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPiHE4-UvIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom, Level Infinite and developers Timi are hoping to change Monster Hunter’s fortunes in 2025 with Monster Hunter Outlanders. This all-new, original title is coming to Mobile (and perhaps PC if you’re smart enough to do some Android emulating), bringing with it the whole Monster Hunter experience, rather than a cut-down mobile version you’d have expected even a few years ago.</p>


<p>Oho ho. This <em>is</em> Monster Hunter. If you’ve played any of the games before, the action is immediately recognisable and fluid, and specifically, it feels like a proper Monster Hunter title. It starts, though, with choosing a character, and there’s a mix of all-new characters with their own look and special skills, alongside the traditional adventurer who’s capable of using any of the included 14 weapons.</p>
<p>They range from Pepe, who uses a Heavy Bowgun, leaping into the air and attacking freely while she’s airborne, through to Madelyne, who attaches spores to monsters while attacking with her Bow, detonating them when they reach a high enough stack. Midori is pegged as an ideal choice for Monster Hunter veterans, using a Long Sword, and retaining the classic Spirit Gauge mechanic, though with better mobility and more ways to build Spirit Gauge.</p>


<p>Staying true to type, I went with Great Sword, though after Wilds, I’m also thoroughly happy playing with the Bow. The character design is once again clearly Monster Hunter, though there’s a perhaps a slight move towards a more Eastern-influenced design rather than Western. It looks like the pre-built characters have been designed to pick up and play a little easier, and as the ones in our demo are largely ranged combatants, it feels like they’re supposed to stay out of danger.</p>
<p>I definitely did not stay out of danger. Our hands-on gave us two monsters to fight, the Radiant Pukei Pukei and the Radiant Rathalos. Both of them were instantly recognisable, but while much of their moveset remains unchanged, there’s a few new moves that will surprise and delight returning fans and veterans. That saw Pukei Pukei raining down poison in a larger AOE attack, while Rathalos’ flame attacks became even more dangerous.</p>

<p>Timi might have eyed up a little bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/wild-hearts-s-review/">Wild Hearts</a> when it was creating Outlanders too, and there’s some new traversal mechanics to help you get around the levels faster, starting with the zipline, which takes you from A to B with ease. There’s also the Ballista, which can fire you semi-gracefully into the sky, from where you can make use of the Breath of the Wild-style glider to get above your prey before hammering down on them with a weapon blow.</p>
<p>There’s also a grappling hook, and maybe even more things that we haven’t seen, but they help to make getting around much easier, even without a Palamute or Seikret to ride on, which has recently become my biggest worry for any future Monster Hunter games. Seriously, do you remember when we had to run everywhere? Outlanders seems to be getting this right, and there’s also fast travel back to camp to keep frustration at a minimum and the hunts coming thick and fast.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about Outlanders is that playing on a touchscreen still worked well, though if you have the option of a controller, you’re going to take that every time. Alongside your regular attacks, with standard combos coming through repeated presses, there’s a series of more mobile moves, a dodge, and then the special move, which lets you dish out some major damage as well as looking very cool.</p>

<p>We were joined through this hunt by an AI character, and I hope that remains an option in the full release, as it’s not always convenient to play with others, something only amplified by the mobile format. There’s also your Palico, and an owl pal called a Trillan, who can help out with some airborne healing, and other support skills, if you need it. He kept me alive once or twice in the heat of battle, and he’s pretty cute to boot. I assume you’ll be able to dress him up with some finery like the rest of your crew.</p>
<p>Visually, Outlanders looks smart and detailed, with lush greenery stretching off into the distance, and the monsters look as good as they have done elsewhere, at least as good as the Hi-Res PS5 version of Monster Hunter Ride. Outlanders is clearly pushing the current crop of mobile hardware pretty hard. Our test unit was an iPhone 16 Pro, and even with a cooling fan, they were running pretty warm – something the 17 Pro has tried to solve that problem. That said, they were also pulling all-day duty on the Tokyo Game Show floor, and by the time I played, they’d have been running for at least four hours, so maybe we shouldn’t put too much stock in that.</p>
<p>I’ve been left impressed and hopeful by Monster Hunter Outlanders. It seems like a true entry in the Monster Hunter franchise, and one which marries classic action with a more recognisable hunting loop. If they get the customisation and crafting right – and there’s not too much in the way of aggressive monetisation – then I can see it being a huge hit on mobile when it launches for iOS and Android.</p>
