		<p>January is a month that most people don’t like. It is cold, dark, and wet. However, the plus side to January is that you can stay inside, get cosy, have a warm drink and relax. Coffee Beans is aiming to replicate some of that vibe with its cosy cafe sim Tailside, which has been given a release date of January 21st.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR9YeieTIj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tailside will let you design your cafe, serve drinks to customers, and follow mini storylines. There are no time pressures to adhere to so players can take things at their own pace. As you make progress, new items and drinks will be unlocked, along with new visitors to the cafe. Tailside will also have a sandbox mode allowing players to decorate the cafe however they wish. Additionally, Tailside will allow players to import their own custom characters into the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/">A demo for Tailside</a> is currently available on Steam ahead of its January 21st release date.</p>
