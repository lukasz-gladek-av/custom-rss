		<p>There is no avoiding the (mechanical) elephant in the room so let’s get it out of the way: Boy oh boy does this game look and play like Sony’s Horizon franchise. A female protagonist with a bow and a big stick for finishers? Check. Set in the far future over multiple biomes including lush rainforests and deserts? Check. Giant mechanical beasts with weak points that glow, that look and even move the same as those in Horizon? Check. Even the music is similar.</p>
<p>There are natives, dressed exactly the same as those in Horizon, the protagonist has a glider exactly the same as Horizon, there’s red grass for stealth, the trailer has characters entering a cave and finding cave paintings a scene lifted from the original HZD Trailer. But hey, completing ripping off one franchise isn’t enough so why not take the Ghost from Destiny and add them in as well, including the exact same scanning animation. </p>

<p>While Horizon can’t lay claim to inventing mechanical beasties, Zoids were doing that back in the 80s, the art style is so similar you could honestly think some of of this trailer was from a Horizon game. </p>
<p>However, Light of Motiram is an open world survival game rather than an action adventure so there is base building, crafting and all that sort of thing. So that’s different and absolutely, totally not the sort of thing that would be in Sony’s upcoming Horizon online multiplayer title. </p>

<p>Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam </a>and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first. </p>

		<p>NBA 2K23 is no longer available to purchase from digital storefronts, as 2K delisted it overnight. This was expected as 2K had confirmed this would be happening in September, and follows the general pattern of NBA 2K game servers being shut down a couple of years after release. NBA 2K23 was released on September 9th, 2022.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K23 | MyCAREER Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khEO9BDIlio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you attempt to search for NBA 2K23 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop you will hit different results. For example, on the Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, and Steam store there will be no listing for the NBA 2K23. While on the Nintendo eShop the game page is still up, but with only the option to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NBA-2K23-2266457.html">wishlist NBA 2K23</a>. The physical editions of NBA 2K23 can still be purchased from various retailers.</p>
<p>On December 31st, the servers for NBA 2K23 will be shutdown. 2K states exactly what this means. <em>“After this date, you will no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing.”</em></p>

		<p>The War of the Worlds: Siberia has got its first proper trailer that gives a look at the game which has been inspired by H.G. Wells classic story. The game is set in 1896, in a world where the Martians have invaded Earth. Cities and nations have fallen to the invasion. London fell first followed by other capital cities. The story of The War of the Worlds: Siberia is set after the invasion of Petrograd, and your are one of the survivors heading east.</p>
<p><iframe title="The War of the Worlds: Siberia — Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63r65WiQoww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The player character is simply called Student. He is separated from his friends and family after fleeing Petrograd, and is embarking on a new life in Siberia on a mission to survive. The War of the Worlds: Siberia is a third person action adventure, in which the Student will use weapons from the era as well as his brain to solve puzzles. The real enemies are the other survivors as groups try to survive in a world where the aliens could strike at any moment. There will be a number of characters that will shape the Student’s journey, both friends and foes.</p>
<p>War of the Worlds: Siberia is not open world and instead will have levels to progress through, with the story being the focus. In this alternative universe Saint Petersburg is Petrograd, even though in our universe, the name Petrograd was not used until 1914. The imperial family is also called Romeyev, not Romanov, and players will not meet any historical figures. Players will not be venturing as far as Lake Baikal, but the Trans-Siberian Railway does appear. Three difficulty levels are planned which will essentially be easy, medium, and hard. Player choice will impact the story in some ways, and there will be abilities to unlock though these will be grounded in reality.&nbsp; At the moment, War of the Worlds: Siberia is only set to be released on PC, though 1C will consider other platforms.</p>
