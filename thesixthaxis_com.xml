		<p>The War of the Worlds: Siberia has got its first proper trailer that gives a look at the game which has been inspired by H.G. Wells classic story. The game is set in 1896, in a world where the Martians have invaded Earth. Cities and nations have fallen to the invasion. London fell first followed by other capital cities. The story of The War of the Worlds: Siberia is set after the invasion of Petrograd, and your are one of the survivors heading east.</p>
<p><iframe title="The War of the Worlds: Siberia — Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63r65WiQoww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The player character is simply called Student. He is separated from his friends and family after fleeing Petrograd, and is embarking on a new life in Siberia on a mission to survive. The War of the Worlds: Siberia is a third person action adventure, in which the Student will use weapons from the era as well as his brain to solve puzzles. The real enemies are the other survivors as groups try to survive in a world where the aliens could strike at any moment. There will be a number of characters that will shape the Student’s journey, both friends and foes.</p>
<p>War of the Worlds: Siberia is not open world and instead will have levels to progress through, with the story being the focus. In this alternative universe Saint Petersburg is Petrograd, even though in our universe, the name Petrograd was not used until 1914. The imperial family is also called Romeyev, not Romanov, and players will not meet any historical figures. Players will not be venturing as far as Lake Baikal, but the Trans-Siberian Railway does appear. Three difficulty levels are planned which will essentially be easy, medium, and hard. Player choice will impact the story in some ways, and there will be abilities to unlock though these will be grounded in reality.&nbsp; At the moment, War of the Worlds: Siberia is only set to be released on PC, though 1C will consider other platforms.</p>

		<p>Motorsport Games has confirmed that all of its NASCAR games will be delisted from digital storefronts on December 31st, 2024. This follows on from the sale of the NASCAR license to iRacing, which has been completed. Motorsport Games is not in the best of positions as it struggles with its finances, with recent financial results stating the company needs more funding to continue operations over the next year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Motorsport Games said, <em>“<span>To the NASCAR game community! From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the NASCAR Heat, </span><span>NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR Ignition </span><span>franchises. Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can! We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you’ve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.”</span></em></p>


<p>The recent <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/motorsport-games-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results/">third quarter 2024 financial results for Motorsport Games</a>, have reference to the company’s troubles, with it saying, <em>“Based on its cash and cash equivalents position and the average monthly cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company’s assets in addition to its recent sales of its NASCAR license and Traxion; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.”</em></p>
<p>Motorsport Games has already seen developers get laid off, and it seems the company could be considering such a move again if it cannot secure additional funding, along with selling other licenses. Motorsport Games currently holds the license for Le Mans.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/stalker-2-patch-1-0-1-promises-over-650-fixes-on-pc-and-xbox/">STALKER 2 patch 1.0.1</a>, which had over 650 fixes for the game on PC and Xbox, GSC Game World has released STALKER 2 Heart of Chornobyl patch 1.0.2. This second patch is not as fix heavy as the first patch, instead fixing some progression issues in some of the game’s missions. Those fixes include making sure enemies spawn when they should, and having characters be where they are supposed to be. Patch notes are below, but be aware of spoilers.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKO4PL8Xzik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when the second wave would not spawn during the “On the Edge” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue when Richter could be found dead during the “A Minor Incident” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the first during the “Just Like the Good Old Days” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the “All That is Left” mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.</li>
<li>Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Scar could be missing during the “Visions of Truth” mission.</li>
<li>A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl Review</a></h2>
<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Stefan said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>
