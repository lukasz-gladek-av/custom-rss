		<p>Digital Extremes and Team17 have released a big update for Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition, porting a whole host of classic Worms game experiences into the modern remaster and console release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition | Backworms Compatible Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Soa8O7CQokg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s particularly curious about how they’ve done this is that, rather than taking the PC release of each Worms Armageddon predecessor, they’ve instead gone with a bunch of console ports and adaptations, taking them from the 16-bit and 32-bit platforms of yore.</p>
<p>The three retro revamps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worms (Super NES)</li>
<li>Worms (Genesis/Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Worms World Party (Game Boy Advance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again, the game already included a playable version of the Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon, so going down the console and handheld path isn’t that outlandish, and these will make for some fun curios to explore.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is the community requested ‘Boggy B’ cheat code, which allows you to just toggle all unlockable content on via the Options Menu.</p>
<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>Launching last September, Anniversary Edition took the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game still has periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>
