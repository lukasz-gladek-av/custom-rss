			<p>I was ten years old when Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles first released. In the days of demo disks and consoles set up in shops, I was able to try the demo at the time and it was the closest a game had gotten to letting you feel like not only a Jedi, but a Jedi of your choice. Nowadays, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi</a> series pretty much nailing the “be a Jedi” thing, you might think that a remaster of the side-scrolling Jedi Power Battles is fodder for nostalgia and nothing more. And you’d be right.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles  - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YboMt_0kAJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Graphically, Jedi Power Battles is a huge improvement with this remastered release. It’s sharp, textures are much higher quality, there’s even reflections in places! If all you’re after is to replay the game, but with it looking like how you remember it in your rose-tinted memories, then this is the game for you.</p>


<p>In fact, it goes further than graphical improvements, with all the playable characters and levels all unlocked from the very beginning. Did you always want to inexplicably be Darth Maul fighting off Federation droids? Well you can do that immediately upon loading the game here, rather than having to first complete the game as Qui Gon Jinn to unlock Maul. And there’s the Star Wars music in the background as well, along with some creative uses of Yoda noises when picking up power ups that still make me laugh. It’s clearly designed to invoke that nostalgia, provided you have some for this game.</p>


<p>But if you don’t have that nostalgia? Well, the issue here is that this was an original PlayStation game. Combat is stiff and doesn’t flow very well at all – I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve run up to an enemy and pressed attack only for it not attack and for the droid I was attacking to punch me in the face instead. Because moves don’t really flow together very well, attacking feels like just swinging a lightsaber repeatedly with a brief delay between them that allows the enemy you’re trying to kill to get a hit in because lightsabers only take about a quarter of their health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can deflect a blaster bolt back at an enemy with a well timed press of the block button – easily the most satisfying aspect of gameplay – and it’ll one-shot them, so blasters deal more damage than lightsabers do, it turns out.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling platforming fares a little better, you can at least judge your jumps well enough to pull them off with relative ease.</p>

<p>What could have made all this stiffness irrelevant is the Force. If you had great Force powers that are fun and make you feel powerful, you might settle for stiff combat. Each character you can play as (excluding those without lightsabers, such as Queen Amidala) has three force powers. One is long range, another short, and another is defensive. Unfortunately they’re incredibly inconsistent as well as inaccurate to the lore.</p>
<p>I started with Darth Maul, because he’s awesome despite the awful film he was in, and his long range power is to shoot a laser from his eyes for some reason. Even so, you’ll be lucky if it actually hits a single one of the crowd of enemies in front of you. Qui Gon Jinn has got a particular set of skills that should make him a nightmare for droids like these, except here his long range and defensive skills don’t seem to work at all for some reason. They just don’t trigger – I get lightsaber attacks or jumps instead and my force power doesn’t drop.</p>
<p>The end result is just inconsistent in the same way that many of Aspyr’s Star Wars remasters have been. It looks nice enough for a remastered PlayStation game, but I just can’t imagine anyone wanting to play it for longer than thirty minutes outside of an attempt to recapture the feeling they had when they were younger and playing it for the first time.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		What Jedi Power Battles really needed was a remake, not a remaster, so that the gameplay could be brought up to something worth playing in this decade. If you want to be a Jedi these days there are way, way better options out there.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ea-cuts-financial-forecasts-as-ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has cut its financial forecasts for the current fiscal year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, its biggest moneyspinner by far, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> both underperformed at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>While the company had been expecting a single-digit growth in “mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings” – these encapsulate everything from game sales to DLC and microtransactions – the end result is that there will instead be a “mid-single-digit decline”. The majority of this is to blame on a slowdown with EA Sports FC 25.</p>


<p>While FC 25 will be the most to blame for the dip in financials, the underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be more worrying for the company’s future direction.</p>
<p>EA say that Dragon Age: The Veilguard “engaged” with around 1.5 million players during its release quarter, but this is down nearly 50 percent on the company’s expectations, and isn’t even an accurate description of total game sales. This is a real shame after the game was generally well received by critics, and a long-awaited return to what BioWare is best known for. Coming a decade on from Dragon Age: Inquisition, a game which won numerous Game of the Year awards in 2014, and which sold 12 million copies over its lifetime, The Veilguard is a big step back from that. That said, it could certainly reach a wider audience through the first half of 2025, if EA push it through subscription services and with targeted promotional discounts.</p>
<p>This naturally causes fresh concerns for the future of BioWare, and puts more pressure on their next game to succeed, with the studios focus having already shifted over to the next Mass Effect game.</p>

<p>We had a good time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with Jason saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">our review</a>, “The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware. It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/insomniac-founder-ted-price-announces-his-retirement-after-30-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Insomniac founder and president Ted Price has announced his retirement from the games industry, having led the company for the past 30 years. He will step down at the end of March 2025 and will be replaced by three studio co-heads.</p>
<p>Ted Price has been integral to Insomniac throughout its history, the creative director behind Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance: Fall of Man. All of them are PlayStation icons for their respective generations, with Ratchet &amp; Clank continuing to be a family friendly favourite to this day.</p>


<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">In his retirement blog post</a>, and after initially addressing the hardship facing many in the wake of the wildfires in California, Price said:</p>
<p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p>

<p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p>
<p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p>
<p>Filling the space that Price is vacating will be three co-heads for the studio: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang.</p>
<p>Schneider joined Insomniac during the PS2 era on the marketing and comms side, and has most recently been Head of Brand and Leadership Strategy. Huang joined eight years ago as CFO and Head of Finance, having previously been a finance exec elsewhere. Lastly, Dezern started at Insomniac back in 1998 as part of the creative team working in various roles as&nbsp;Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and as the Head of Creative since 2017.</p>
<p>Of the trio, Price writes:</p>
<p>For many years, Chad, Jen and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p>
<p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p>
