		<p>Bungie has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> gameplay reveal will take place on 12th April, after their fans managed to complete an ARG to reveal the date of the reveal. Could you imagine if they hadn’t managed it in time?</p>
<p>Streaming at 6PM UK time / 7PM CEST / 1PM ET / 10AM PT, Bungie’s developers will debut Marathon gameplay alongside news and updates for the game. Here’s a teaser trailer with a pink robot cat in it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first new project from Bungie since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny</a>, Marathon is a PvPvE team-based extraction shooter set on the planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players will inhabit the bodies of cybernetic mercenaries known as Runners who can survive the planet’s harsh environment while searching the abandoned colony and surrounding planet for loot, including new weapons and gear.</p>
<p>It takes what feels like rather loose inspiration from Bungie’s 1994 FPS, Marathon, an early counterpart to Doom that was a Mac exclusive before spreading to PC with its sequel. The first game was set aboard a colony ship that was under attack by the S’pht and Pfhor alien races, while the ship’s AI gained sentience through a process known as Rampancy – a theme that carried forward to the Halo series. The sequels jetted across to other planets in the universe, delving into time travel and alternate realities.</p>

<p>But don’t expect that story to be told through this new game in anywhere near the same way – you can, at least, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/11/classic-marathon-free-steam/">play the originals for free</a>. Speaking back at the game’s reveal in 2023, Game Director Christopher Barrett said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Marathon is designed from the start as a PvP-focused game and won’t have a single-player campaign. Instead, with the PvP experience as our foundation, we’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

		<p>Neon Abyss 2 is filled with cyberpunk vibes, absurd over-the-top weapons, and some of the most modern and disquieting takes on gods going. It’s a vibrant nightmare of a roguelike with plenty of style and flair, but it also feels incredibly reminiscent of the first game. That’s obviously not a bad thing – why fix what isn’t broken? – and fans of the first game will already have this on their wish lists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re once again thrown into the bright dystopia that has you fighting for your life after you drop out of a bar into the underworld. The general formula is much the same as it was before. That means you’ll be running around shooting things, trying to survive in different areas and gathering different currencies to then spend in shops and on upgrades. This doesn’t feel meaningfully different than the first game, but, to be fair, the first game felt very solid in this respect, so that’s fine.</p>


<p>Where the game does differ is in some of its general progression. The new Faith system basically lets you unlock special rooms as you’re playing that can have a variety of effects. Sometimes that means you’ll be able to gamble a lot of money to get fancy new items, sometimes it’ll be crafting, and sometimes it’ll just be an artifact of some kind. It makes it worth trying to play a little bit differently as you go, but you can often just sort of power through if you want as well.</p>


<p>The weapons feel better and more worthwhile now as well. Weapons have levels, with new ones often being higher level. However, if you decide to stick to the weapon you’ve fallen in love with, such as the gun that turns your eggs into a big old dragon to attack enemies with, then you can choose to stay faithful to it. If you do that, you can gain experience for the weapon to actually level it up, and when you do so you’ll get a reward. It’s a fun extra wrinkle in trying to decide what weapon to use.</p>
<p>There are some excellent choices now as well. Even the standard weapon fires a laser shot every so often, but you can get gloves that send out mighty long-range punches, weapons that convert your grenades into rockets, and a wide range of melee weapons that can slash through space. &nbsp;It’s pretty hard to argue with a katana that can cut through space and time, you know?</p>

<p>All-in-all, Neon Abyss 2 already feels very slick. A lot of the value of these kinds of roguelikes is hidden behind layers of secrets and unlocks though, so while I enjoyed my time with the preview build, I want to get my hands on the full version before settling into my thoughts on the game. For those who loved the first game and just want more though, you’ll be getting plenty of that with this follow-up, and you’re sure to enjoy some of the new systems and weapons as well. At least you don’t have too long to wait on that front.</p>
