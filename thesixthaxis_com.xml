		<p>The PC port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> launched on Thursday, but the game has had a “Mixed” reception in the Steam user reviews as many players complain about performance, graphical issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Sony leant on their in-house porting team at Nixxes to handle the port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, but while they traditionally have a good reputation for their PC ports, this one has fallen flat, joining a number of other PlayStation PC ports that have had a rocky landing.</p>


<p>We’re working on our own impressions of the PC port, but just to grab <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/765Tet/recommended/2651280/">one </a>of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">the many negative Steam reviews</a>, “I have an RTX 4070ti, on high graphics and no raytracing I get crashes […] Even when it’s not crashing, shadows flicker for no good reason and it feels like it struggles to render hair at times.”</p>
<p>Part of this is down to performance. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/10/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-review/">Spider-Man Remastered</a> and Miles Morales were well received for their performance, those games fundamentally had the PS4 platform as the base target for Insomniac’s original creation, and were designed with ray tracing as an additive feature. Spider-Man 2 only launched for PS5 and so could always feature ray tracing, could always rely on the fast NVMe SSD loading times, and the fundamental uplift that the console provided.</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2’s PC port actually scaled back down to GPUs without ray-tracing features, with a broad set of hardware and performance targets to go from 720p30 up to full 4K with “Ultimate” ray tracing.</p>

<p>The problems that players are encountering seem to run the full gamut, and affect both Nvidia and AMD GPUs alike with performance dips, frame rate stutters and running out of VRAM even with a 16GB card. The majority of PC gamers have gone with Nvidia, and with many newly implemented graphical options seem to come plenty of problems.</p>
<p>Odd driver issues can lead to full-blown crashes citing GPU temperatures. Elsewhere Nvidia’s bespoke ray reconstruction for improving ray traced reflections and certain other DLSS features are claimed to actually reduce frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198820911436/recommended/2651280/">One user has a potential performance aid,</a> saying “Before you play, open the install folder of the game,make a new folder and drag dsstorage.dll and dsstoragecore.dll into the new folder to improve load times, low fps and micro freezes!”</p>
<p>Essentially, this ditches the game’s use of Direct Storage, which has certain requirements for SSD speeds and technology. It’s not clear how this would help, as in theory it would reduce SSD read performance, but perhaps there are some bugs with the system.</p>
<p>As for the other issues, turning down ray-tracing effects and relying less on DLSS features that use AI to fill in the blanks seems to have an effect. In general, it feels like players will want to wait for a patch from Nixxes and a fresh driver update from Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia is also juggling a new GPU generation launch and adding more trickery to their drivers right around now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> will launch on 25th March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Want to try it out sooner? Well, there’s a closed beta coming in February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Siren Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5hsuRpMiDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Killing Floor 3 closed beta will take place from 20th-24th February across all platforms, giving Tripwire a great chance to stress test the live launch. You need to sign up for access, which you can do on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor website</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s multiple editions of the game, some region specific, in partnership with Plaion as their distributions partner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99) – Available in North America, includes the base game and a pre-order bonus, either the limited timed exclusive Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack<strong>, </strong>or the Flatline Tactical Bundle (at select retailers).</li>
<li><strong>Day 1 Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99) – Available outside North America, includes the base game, Flatline Tactical Bundle, and Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there’s two digital editions, in addition to a base game version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>(MSRP of $59.99) – Includes the Shadow Agent Specialist &amp; Weapon Skin Sets, Launch Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Creds.</li>
<li><strong>Elite Nightfall Edition </strong>(MSRP of $79.99) – Includes everything from the Deluxe Edition plus Year 1 Premium Nightfall Supply Pass Access (four passes) and 3000 Creds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves.</p>
<p>The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims 1 & 2 have been re-released for the series’ 25th birthday]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/the-sims-1-2-have-been-re-released-for-the-series-25th-birthday/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-1-2-have-been-re-released-for-the-series%E2%80%99-25th-birthday.1097568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/the-sims-1-2-have-been-re-released-for-the-series-25th-birthday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marking the 25th anniversary of series, EA has re-released the first two games and all their expansion in The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sims &amp; The Sims 2 Legacy Collections - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQUMkHngWjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Both are available now ahead of the franchise’s birthday on 4th February, on sale separately or combed in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle along with The Sims 4 Grunge Revival Kit and The Sims 4 Throwback Kit bundled in with each game respectively.</p>
<p>Both games have been tweaked and updated to help them work with modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines.</p>
<p>For The Sims it now supports aspect ratios other than 4:3 and will automatically set itself to your monitor’s aspect ratio on launch. There’s also crisper rendering – though you can cycle through different scaling options with Alt + Enter – and they’ve fixed a handful of crashes and bugs while they’re at it.</p>

<p>The Sims 2 seemingly needed more work to get working, with the following change list:</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphicsRules.sgr now supports modern hardware configurations</li>
<li>Fixed a shadow bug that surrounded Sims with a big black square</li>
<li>Wide screen and higher game resolutions are now supported</li>
<li>UI scales better to higher resolutions</li>
<li>Texture memory corruption and “pink soup” are fixed</li>
<li>Dragging The Sims 2 window from one monitor to another works more smoothly</li>
<li>If your computer has a lot of RAM, The Sims 2 is able to use it</li>
<li>Fixed several crashes</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, there’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iej4qa/sims_2_legacy_not_launching_for_me/">plenty of technical complaints with DirectX 9.0c errors</a> for some with The Sims 2 – seemingly high refresh rates and/or resolutions above 1080p don’t play too nice. It’s also quite a shame that, even though it would have taken more work to re-port them to new hardware, there’s no Mac versions for these releases.</p>
<p>Oh, and the IKEA pack is missing from The Sims 2, much to the dismay of quirkily named flat pack furniture fans around the world.</p>
