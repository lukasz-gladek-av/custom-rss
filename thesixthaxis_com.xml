		<p>Focus and developer Saber Interactive have released a new gameplay overview trailer for RoadCraft, their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mudrunner">MudRunner</a> spin-off themed around the mechanised recover efforts after natural disasters. RoadCraft is coming out on 20th May 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>RoadCraft is following in the tyre tracks of Expeditions, though is doing it without the MudRunner branding. There’s some inherently familiar gameplay ideas here, with things like the depth sensor for when driving through water, but instead of focussing on exploration, everything has been channelled in to disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Their’s eight regions that have been stricken by a variety of natural disasters, from floods to relentless sandstorms, with players then having to take on the effort to assess the damage, clear the destruction and rebuild in the aftermath to restore key infrastructure including roads and bridges. Fans of large construction vehicles will be overjoyed to see the dozens of vehicles that include big yellow diggers, cranes, logging vehicles, some stupendously large cutter wheels, and more. There’s a greater emphasis throughout the world on physics interaction, so you can push boulders around, clear up debris and then let you lay the sandbanks and asphalt that’s then steam-rollered to create new impromptu roadways.</p>
<p>RoadCraft will be playable solo, of course, but also has support for up to four player co-op, which will help every job go faster… so long as you don’t keep stopping for tea breaks!</p>


<p>Looking back on the last game in this loosely defined series from Saber, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, Dom said</a>, “While Expeditions is undoubtedly fun, it’s focused, intense and challenging fun, and it’s not for the sort of person who looks for a quick and easy way to test how deep the water is. If you struggle to play games that require planning, sneaking or puzzle solving these are all applicable skills you’ll need to succeed in Expeditions.”</p>
<p>RoadCraft sounds like it will be very similar in that regard.</p>

		<p>No doubt fuelling speculation about a series revival, Capcom has released the original Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 into the wild once more, adding them to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">GOG.com’s Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dino Crisis | Trailer [GOG]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFj7yBrt6So?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dino Crisis was a PS1 hit from the Resident Evil team, sharing a lot of similar game concepts to the zombie mansion thriller, but with dinosaurs and a much faster pacing. That survival horror of the first game was then ditched almost entirely for more of an action-shooter style for the sequel a year later.</p>
<p>With the success of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/">Resident Evil remakes</a> that brought a much more modern third person view and gameplay to the classics, and with the dinosaur-filled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/24/exoprimal-review/">Exoprimal</a>, fans of Dino Crisis have been feeling a bit left out in the cold.</p>
<p>The Dino Crisis duo have had some major restorative work in their re-release on GOG.com, with the GOG Preservation Program ensuring that there’s full compatibility with modern Windows systems, added render options with up to 4K resolution support, and added functionality for a menagerie of gamepads. They’ve even gone in and fixed bugs like a save corruption issue when leaving dropped weapons!</p>

<p>The games are available individually for £8.99 or in a bundle for £15.29.</p>
