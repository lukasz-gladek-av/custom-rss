		<p>It’s looking like a lovely weekend, not only for sinking into RPGs new, old and remastered, but also for some DIY, housework and gardening. What big plans do you have while there’s good, but not too hot weather?</p>

</ul>
<p>However, the two biggest games of the week have gone unscored for the time being. Gamoc wrote a review in progress for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/"><strong> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>, the great new turn-based RPG with a truly unique style, while Jim shared his thoughts on <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/25/oblivion-remastered-is-perfect-for-fans-on-the-long-wait-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>&nbsp;</strong>and what it means for long-suffering TES fans who are patiently waiting for a new sequel.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Dom had a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/f1-25s-braking-point-3-aims-to-tell-motorsports-most-impactful-story/"><strong>F1 25’s returning Braking Point 3 story mode</strong></a>, which is arriving right around the time of the F1 movie and will provide an interesting parallel narrative. I went hands on with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/tron-catalyst-preview-glitchy-but-in-a-good-way/">TRON: Catalyst</a></strong>, the isometric action game from Bithell that will continue on the world narrative they started in TRON: Identity.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman&nbsp;</strong>was flush with gaming time, so he dipped back into Atomfall, made some more progress in Blue Prince where he’s considering looking up a guide to connect a few of the dots, and made a start on Oblivion’s remaster soaking up the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead and we’ll see you back here on Tuesday!</p>
