		<p>Coming from the creator of Turbo Overkill, the survival horror Total Chaos is no longer “coming soon”, it’s out now! Total Chaos is available for PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s a day one game for Xbox Game Pass as well. Steam VR support is expected to arrive in Q2 2026.</p>

<p>It’s an impressive trailer for the game, with some deeply unsettling visuals and perspectives, playing out as a first person horror and lookin to blend both classic and modern horror sensibilities together. </p>
<p>Across the 9 chapters journey through to the heart of Fort Oasis, along the way you’ll be able to lean on both melee and ranged weapons, building new weapons from scrap and scavenging as you go. </p>
<p>Your journey will also be accompanied by a soundtrack that features a new original theme from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, and an ambient soundtrack from composers Jason Dagenet &amp; William Braddell, and Apogee’s Tim Stoney, Chipper Hammond, and Mathieu Hallouin.</p>

<p>Total Chaos has its roots in a modern Doom II total conversion. First conceptualised by Sam in 2008 and then developed from 2012 through 2018, Total Chaos has now been completely rebuilt as a fully standalone experience, and expanded from six chapters to nine.</p>

		<p>Eclipse Glow Games shared a big long look at their upcoming action-adventure game, a spectacular visual feast of a boss battle that’s inspired by Arthurian Legend. The game is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there’s no date set just yet. </p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | &quot;Break the Mirror&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Players will step into the role of Gwendolyn, with this boss battle seeing her face off against the witch Tyronoe through multiple realms. This is a Dual Frontline battle, where you battle through a mirrored, folded realm as both Gwendolyn and the knight Sir Lamorak.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on throughout, from shattering the divide between worlds, to fighting on a lake and within its reflective surface, and to a big fiery ball that you need to blow up before it’s too late. </p>
<p>It really is quite special as a visual showcase, built within Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>I also find that it’s quite a satisfying turnabout for the usual game creation tale of Western developers looking to Asian mythology and history for inspiration. Eclipse Glow Games is a Chinese studio that’s borrowed from British myths instead, setting Tides of Annihilation in a devastated and distorted version of London, following an Outworld invasion, and crossing over to the mythical realm of Avalon. </p>
