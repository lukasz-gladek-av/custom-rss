		<p>Rebellion’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set to whisk players back to the early 1960s later this month, creating an alternate universe following the Windscale nuclear disaster in the North of England, letting you explore a locked down version of the Lake District that’s filled with strange mysteries, druids, military police and plenty more.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game ahead of its release on 27th March – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/07/atomfall-preview-surviving-a-very-british-supernatural-nuclear-disaster/">read our Atomfall preview here</a> – but also had the chance to sit down with Ryan Greene, art director on the game, to chat about some of the inspirations, the world that they’ve created and more!</p>
