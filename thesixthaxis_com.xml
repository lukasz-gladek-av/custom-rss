		<p>In a world of forgotten 3D platforming stars, Croc is a green, snappy reminder that time has no meaning, and that your childhood was genuinely only a few moments ago, rather than the truth. If you’re ready to put on your nostalgia shoes, and think about a time when Sony’s PlayStation didn’t need a number because it was the only one, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos Remaster is due to release on the 2nd of April 2025, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC as a GOG exclusive.</p>

<p>This beloved title from Argonaut Games, founded by 3D gaming visionary Jez San OBE, harkens back to a time where 3D platforming was the apex predator of the gaming scene. It captured the hearts of players worldwide in the late ’90s – the original really did release in 1997 – and is now making a triumphant return with stunning new visuals, updated quality-of-life features, and an array of exciting additions that are sure to delight longtime fans and new players alike. These features will evoke a sense of nostalgia and deepen appreciation for the game’s rich history.</p>

<p>The remastered Croc Legend of the Gobbos brings the heart-warming journey of Croc, the humble and courageous little crocodile, equipped with his iconic backpack and wiggly butt back to life with vibrant high-definition graphics, modern controls and an updated camera system (thankfully) and refined gameplay mechanics. Players will once again embark on a delightful quest across a series of imaginative worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to rescue the adorable Gobbos from the nefarious Baron Dante’s grasp. Players will navigate Croc through beautifully recrafted levels brimming with quirky enemies, puzzles, and hidden secrets in order to save Croc’s adoptive family of  Gobbos from captivity.</p>

<p>The original Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remains a much-loved title in many gamers’ back catalogue, and it’ll be interesting to see how the remaster fares when it launches on the 2nd of April.</p>
