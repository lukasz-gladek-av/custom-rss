		<p>Nintendo has announced that they are ending the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> subscribers, removing them from sale on 30th January 2026.</p>
<p>Any vouchers purchased prior to the end of the programme will still be valid for use for the usual 12 months before they expire, but no further vouchers will be sold after 11:59 PM in your local market on 30th January 2026. So the vouchers will last until 30th January 2027.</p>


<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were introduced as part of Nintendo Switch Online, a popular way of getting Nintendo’s games at a discount, outside of rare sale periods. Purchased in a pair for $100 / £84, you could then redeem these vouchers against two games from a curated catalogue of titles. With games often priced at $60 / £50, this could net a combined saving of $20 / £16. Potentially even more, as the £60 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a part of the program, and the new and upcoming titles, such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, can also be included.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for this program when Nintendo announced increased game prices for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers can only be redeemed against Switch games, as it stands, so the aforementioned Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Tears of the Kingdom would then need a further upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The value of the offer can also be seen to be diminishing for savvy gamers who are happy to wait for Nintendo to put parts of their back catalogue on sale. At those times, games can drop to around £30, which is obviously a much larger discount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a week after Krafton replaced the co-founders and leaders of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer Unknown Worlds, the company has now confirmed that the game’s early access release will be delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>There’s been plenty speculation over the reason why Krafton removed the studio leaders last week, with a $250 million bonus on the line and the possibility that Subnautica 2’s release could be delayed. Having reviewed the purchase agreement for the studio in 2021, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> is able to report that the $250 million bonus was due to kick in if Unknown Worlds was able to hit a revenue target by the end of 2025. With no Subnautica 2 launch this year, the studio is unlikely to hit that target, and so employees could miss out, per Bloomberg’s anonymous sources.</p>


<p>So it’s no surprise now that Krafton is adamant that the firings and delay have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of bonus agreement, while founder Charlie Cleveland claims that the game was ready for an early access release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/embed/inset/iframe">a blog post on the series subreddit</a>, Cleveland said, “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">In a contrary statement, Krafton said that the delay stemmed from feedback from early tests and “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Meanwhile, in a town hall meeting with new CEO Steve Papoutsis, he said, “The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> available for its early access. While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, ‘Hey we should launch this,’ that wasn’t where both parties aligned around.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">That does seem to suggest that an Early Access was plausible with the game as it is now. However, he added “it’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that.”</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">It’s an ugly mess for a game that was one of the most highly-anticipated titles on Steam for this year (or any year, to be honest).</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">But at least the co-founders are now free to go and make more games. Signing off on his blog, Cleveland says, “I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends.”</p>
