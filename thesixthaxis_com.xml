		<p>Update 1.55 is out now for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and it’s got some great new cars and additions to the racing game, including a new formula car inspired by classic 90s F1 designs, and wider support for the Gran Turismo Sophy AI.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - January 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLBtn5F5j2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Four cars have been added in Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gran Turismo F3500-A</li>
<li>Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) ’87</li>
<li>Hyundai IONIQ 5 N ‘24</li>
<li>Toyota C-HR S ’18</li>
</ul>
<p>All four can be purchased from Brand Central, giving us a modern crossover SUV, a rather popular electric car, an 80s touring car classic, and the original formula racing car as well.</p>
<p>The F3500-A is inspired by early 90s F1 cars, and I can definitely see shades of the Williams FW14B and FW15C, the McLaren MP4/8 and Jordan 191 in the curved from nose down to the front wing – there’s going to be some awesome custom liveries for this probably by later today! In-game, this will have a 3.5L naturally aspirated V12 that’s going to scream with high RPMs as you go through the 6-speed semi-auto gearbox.</p>

<p>Beyond the cars, there’s a new Extra Menu No. 43 for Group C cars, and there’s new World Circuit events:</p>
<p>Sunday Cup: Kyoto Driving Park – Miyabi<br>
Japanese FF Challenge 450: Sardegna – Road Track – C<br>
World Touring Car 600: Autódromo de Interlagos</p>
<p>Gran Turismo Sophy has also been expanded to two more circuits, no available to race against at Autódromo de Interlagos and Mount Panorama Circuit.</p>
<p>A strong update to start 2025!</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the 30th anniversary classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 themes will be removed from consoles tomorrow, January 21st, 2025. However, due to their popularity,&nbsp;they will return.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the fantastic response to the classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 limited-time console themes, which will be leaving tomorrow,” reads a post on <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1884979891067863448">Twitter</a>. “Due to the positive response on these 4 themes, we’re doing some work behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.”</p>


<p>“While there aren’t plans to create additional themes in the future, we’re excited to keep celebrating legacy PlayStation hardware with you all,” added Sony.</p>
<p>Themes were popular for both the PS3 and PS4 console user interfaces but are notably absent on PlayStation 5 with the 30th anniversary themes being the only ones available. Clearly, the tech is in place for themes to work on the console but for some reason, Sony has decided not to make any for the PS5. They used to be a regular occurrence on the older consoles with themes launched to promote upcoming games or events.</p>

<p>With the 30th anniversary period coming to a close, it’s odd Sony didn’t make a bigger event of it. There were no game announcements,&nbsp; no parties, no celebrations,&nbsp; not even a fan vote for the best PlayStation game of all time. What we did get was a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/sony-reveal-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary/">free-to-play version of Gran Turismo,</a> some soundtracks on Spotify, and a weird board game though so… yay for those?</p>
