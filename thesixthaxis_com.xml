		<p>Collector’s editions all try to contain something special for the most diehard of fans to get their hands on, by spending a bit more. Many contain statues or other physical goodies, along with some exclusive digital content. The most expensive one that was ever released was the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/09/saints-row-ivs-insane-1000000-pre-order-bonus-detailed/">Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition,</a> which was priced at $1million and offered a Lamborghini Gallardo. Today, Wired Productions has announced a £500,000 collector’s edition for DIG VR. While you won’t get a Lamborghini Gallardo, the buyer would get two custom wrapped JCB 100c-2 excavators.</p>



<p>One of the excavators will be wrapped by Asheville, and the buyer will be able to discuss with them what kind of wrap they want. The other excavator will be wrapped with reference to DIG VR. That is not all the buyer of this Dig VR Collector’s Edition will get. They would also get two Meta Quest 3 VR headsets, two copies of DIG VR, a year’s pass to Diggerland in Kent, a trip to Las Vegas to visit Dig This, a tour of the JCB Museum in the UK, custom hard hat and high vis jacket, their name added to the game credits, and a sticker sheet.</p>
<p>Will the DIG VR Collector’s Edition actually sell? The audience of someone having £500,000 available and being a massive JCB enthusiast will be very small, I imagine. There was no evidence ever provided that the Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition ever sold, so if someone did buy this they would set a spending record on a game collector’s edition.</p>

		<p>Inflexion Games has announced that it is reducing staff numbers, primarily because the early access phase for its PvE game Nightingale has not been commercially successful enough to maintain its current size. As a result, Inflexion Games will be closing its UK office and is undergoing a restructure in its Canada office. The full statement from CEO Aaryn Flynn can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 Trailer | Gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLcyuMZqcG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The past few weeks here at Inflexion Games have been incredibly challenging, and no words can adequately express the sadness we feel. Like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Although we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished with Nightingale to date – as well as the enthusiasm and support from our community – the Early Access release hasn’t been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio’s previous size. As a result, we’re undergoing a restructuring process in Canada, and we will also be closing our UK office.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Our priority is to support each member of the team affected by the reductions as they search for new opportunities. We thank them for their invaluable contributions to Nightingale – it would not have been possible without their immense talent and passion for adventuring in the Faewilds. While this is a difficult moment for the entire team, we will continue to work tirelessly, alongside our players, as we move forward as a studio. I will be available to answer questions from the community and will provide more details on our upcoming updates soon. In the meantime, I hope our players will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks to our departing team members for everything they have contributed.”</em></p>

<p>Nightingale launched into early access in February this, and in September a major update called Realms Rebuilt was released, that added a new campaign, new bosses, and a lot of changes to the way the game works. It also allowed players to build bigger estates for themselves. Going by this week’s announcement, it seems that this major update has not had the desired effect of significantly increasing the player base.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/two-point-museum-preview-dust-off-your-leather-elbow-patches/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-point-museum-preview-%E2%80%93-dust-off-your-leather-elbow-patches.1024062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/two-point-museum-preview-dust-off-your-leather-elbow-patches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two Point Studios must have a thing for leather elbow patches. A stereotypical part of college and university professor dress for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus</a>, they’re also pretty prevalent in museum curators, I’m sure. Hence, Two Point Museum –&nbsp;the latest management sim that will have you reviving an ailing industry across Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the elbow patches remain the same, and the general gist of a management sim will be familiar, the actual workings of a museum are rather different to a hospital or university. Instead of managing a flow from diagnosis through to treatment, or trying to teach and train students to get a passing grade from one semester to another, a museum has much more in common with a theme park. You want a museum to entertain as much as it should enlighten, and there needs to be a flow through the building, taking people from exhibit to exhibit, before dumping them into a gift shop to buy all the kinds of tat that will actually pay the bills.</p>


<p>The thing you really need to be thinking about when designing a layout and an exhibit is the “buzz” that it provides, the excitement and interest that it instills in your guests. As wondrous as a giant prehistoric footprint might be, it means very little without a bit of info alongside, so you’ll naturally want to put up a few info stands to provide that. And since it’s a prehistoric artefact, why not dress up the environment a little to theme it around this? You will want an expert on hand to make sure that a stand is well preserved and maintained, but between the buzz it generates, the knowledge that is imparted and the general decoration that you put down, you’ll build up the environment score of an exhibit.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to place some donation bins for people to chuck coins into as a reward for your hard work. That’s before they get to the gift shops that you can fill with themed items to match your museum and exhibits.</p>


<p>The building tools are really nice and straightforward, bringing the ease of creation from the previous games, dropping items down with a handy snap to grid to keep things in order, creating blueprints for rooms, and more. There’s some really extensive colour options to let you get exactly the look that you want, and there’s greater ease for putting things on an angle with diagonal internal walls, halved floor tiles, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, just because they’re paying your bills doesn’t mean you can really trust visitors. Whether it’s vandals, thieves or invariably bored children getting up to no good, you’ll need to have security cameras and guards meandering around to try and make sure your exhibits are kept in good order. You can help to keep them on the rails, as it were, with tour guides that take groups through the museum in a more orderly fashion, as well.</p>
<p>As you would expect, there’s a great humorous twist to all of the exhibits that you can display through your museums, with Two Point Studios well known for their pun-filled games. I particularly enjoy the stone-carved computers, goofy looking dioramas, frozen prehistoric men still in their ice blocks, and even when it’s a fairly sensible looking dino skeleton, it’s got a great cartoony style. The marine life museum goes all in on oversized tentacle monsters and strange-looking fish, while the freshly announced ghost museum has you featuring spectres in Polterguest Rooms, floating furniture, haunted TVs and puppets, and more.</p>

<p>But where do these exhibits come from? You can’t just pop to the history shop to buy a Sharpontops skeleton, after all. This is where your hired experts come in handy, as you send them out on expeditions to dig sites and other locations to try and find those precious artefacts and bring them back. You can choose how much time and leeway they should have on these missions, whether speedy, safe or detailed in their search, and that will impact how likely they are to be successful in bringing things back. Skeletons will take multiple expeditions to find all of the parts, and each expedition location on the map will have a number of discoverable items to search for.</p>
<p>Should they find something, they’ll come back with a big ol’ crate for you to open up&nbsp;– replete with a glorious loot crate animation –&nbsp;and then decide where you want it to go.</p>

<p>That’s not the only thing that they can bring back with them, as a risk of every expedition is that experts come back with some kind of physical ailment. They could end up with sticky feet that make them tardy, they could be snake bitten, and plenty more besides. Thankfully it’s not too difficult to sort them out with recovery pods that you can place in the staff room for them to heal up in –&nbsp;I’d love to see some kind of tie in back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>. but this might be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>After Hospital and Campus, Two Point Museum brings another fresh setting for the team’s fun-filled take on management games. I’ve really enjoyed the themes revealed so far, and can’t wait to see what the wider game has in store when it comes out in March.</p>

		<p>A fresh exhibit and location has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, the latest quirky management game in the Two Point series, with Ghostology featuring spooks, spectres, the undead and more. Two Point Museum is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/two-point-museum-curates-a-march-2025-release-date/">4th March 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With all the tongue-in-cheek japes and jokes sprinkled throughout the game, it’s good fun to try and spot all the references in the trailer. I definitely spotted a The Ring TV set, a haunted puppet and more generic floating tables and poltergeists.</p>
<p>This range of exhibits will be most heavily featured in the Wailon Lodge level, an old holiday hotel that lies in ruins, until you turn up to turn it into a supernatural museum. The Lodge will see you join up with Winston Wailon to curate a bunch of exhibits throughout, with Polterguest Rooms to invite spirits to be residents and expeditions to the Netherworld Rift to bring back historic remnants and creepy relics.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that, as quirky and fun as the exhibits might look, this probably isn’t a museum you want to spend a night at!</p>
<p>Wailon Lodge joins previously revealed locations at Memento Mile and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tI85pecH1g">Passwater Cove</a>, with Two Point Studios cooking up a bunch of inventive levels that you might consider turning into a museum.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>
