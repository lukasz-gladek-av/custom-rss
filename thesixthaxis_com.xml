		<p>It’s the middle of the sporting summer in the UK, with Wimbledon, the British Grand Prix, cricket and the warm up matches for the Lions tour all going on. Obviously anything in the UK is subject to British weather, and it definitely seems to be returning to type for the weekend.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li>TSBonyman’s about 70 hours into Tainted Grail, which is a huge amount of time, but he’s suffering a crash maybe once per 4-5 hour play session, which he’s putting up with and thankfully isn’t affecting his enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>
