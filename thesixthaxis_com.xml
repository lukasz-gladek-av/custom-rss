		<p>We just had to write this one up, because it’s not every day that you find out there’s going to be a new game for the Mega Drive – or Genesis if you’re of the American persuasion. Yes folks, someone has decided that releasing games on modern consoles is too passé, too easy, and instead decided that they’d bring a new title to a console that’s been dead and buried for nearly three decades. That game? Earthion, an old-school scrolling shoot ’em up, which will release on physical cartridge for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, alongside PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earthion Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PP59afi7FD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Even more exciting than a new cartridge, is the fact that it also boasts a 27-track soundtrack from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro, whose previous works include Streets of Rage, ActRaiser and The Revenge of Shinobi. So, not only is it going to look like the 90s and come on a 90s cartridge, it’s going to sound like the 90s as well.</p>
<p>Earthion has been created by Japanese dev team Ancient Corporation – owned, in fact by Yuzo Koshiro – and it’s a space-themed 2D side scrolling shooter that sees you taking control of ace pilot Azusa Takahashi through 8 levels of space mayhem, each with unique environments, enemies and huge, screen-filling bosses.</p>


<p>This being a modern retro title, players will be able to configure scanlines and emulate CRT TVs when playing on modern platforms. Mega Drive players should be just fine without. There will also be mutiple difficulty levels, a challenge mode, a level password system and online leaderboards, though here the Mega Drive meets its match, and you’ll just have to get your friends round to compete against like in the good old days.</p>
<p>Earthion is due to arrive later this year for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. You can wishlist it now on Steam!</p>
