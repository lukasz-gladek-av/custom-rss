<p>The PS5 and Xbox Series XS versions will have 60 fps, up to 4K resolution, HDR support, and enhanced image quality. The Switch 2 version will support mouse controls, DLSS, HDR, and 60 fps. PS4 and Switch players will also be able to carry over save data so they can continue where they left off. The mobile version will have touch controls, and it will be this version on Netflix too. The updated version will also be part of the PS Plus Game Catalog and the GTA+Games Library.</p>

<p>Way back in 2010, we said in our review of Red Dead Redemption, <em>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general.&nbsp; We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars.&nbsp; The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption.&nbsp; A job we don’t envy.”</em></p>

		<p>The survival game Solarpunk has been delayed to 2026, developer Cyberwave has announced. The team has decided to the delay Solarpunk as more development time is needed to address improvements and stability for the multiplayer side of the game. Other improvements revolve around Solarpunk’s inventory system, the piloting of airships, and improved performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solarpunk - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy41Qv7Ut14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cyberwave detailed the improvements it is working on for Solapunk and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inventory management:</b>&nbsp;Players really want “craft from storage,” sorting options, and bigger stack sizes.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Airship controls:&nbsp;</b>Some found flying a bit too sensitive and wished for an autopilot option for long trips.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Early-game pacing:</b>&nbsp;Cotton grows too slowly and tools break too fast, making the early hours grindy.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Late-game goals:&nbsp;</b>Players want more content, quests, and reasons to keep exploring.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Performance:</b>&nbsp;Thunderstorms caused FPS drops and lightning bugs that sometimes hit players unfairly.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Animal systems:&nbsp;</b>Some pathfinding issues caused animals to get stuck and stop producing.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Controller support:</b>&nbsp;Needs more polish to fully support controller and Steam Deck play.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Tutorials:</b>&nbsp;Players asked for clearer explanations for systems like electricity and crop sheltering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahead of Solarpunk’s release, there will be a multiplayer playtest in which players can work together co-operatively. Cyberwave will be gradually increasing the number of co-op players allowed into the playtest once it goes live, and a date is yet to be given for the multiplayer playtest. Following that playtest, Cyberwave will go and address other bugs and issues that get raised by players so Solarpunk can be properly polished ahead of its release. A release window is not yet confirmed.</p>
