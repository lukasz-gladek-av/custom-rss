		<p>Today’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has disappointingly been met with a wave of complaints from PC players over the game’s performance.</p>
<p>With the game’s Steam reviews rating sat at Mixed, Capcom has responded and offered some basic troubleshooting tips.</p>


<p>A post by the official Monster Hunter Status social media account says,&nbsp;“If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings.”</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry’s analysis</a> of the PC version of the game highlights a number of fundamental issues that they found with the game. In particular, there’s a very lengthy shader compilation stage that could last 13 minutes on a Ryzen 5 3600. The automatic graphics settings seemingly fail to handle adjusting texture quality to match available VRAM on 8GB cards (leading to hefty stutters), and even if that’s adjusted, they continued to see stutters during camera movement. Even with more than 8GB VRAM, they suggest keeping texture settings reduced at this time, and suspect that there’s some issues with GPU-based DirectStorage texture decompression overloading the hardware.</p>
<p>This seems to be a bit more than just needing to have your drivers updated, and it’s yet another wonky PC game release – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/01/spider-man-2-pc-port-gets-a-rough-reception-over-performance-and-graphical-issues/">Spider-Man 2</a> at the end of January. Here’s hoping that further driver updates and some game tweaks in updates can help with performance as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Still, here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Capcom’s troubleshooting steps</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for the game.</li>
<li>Update your Video/Graphics Drivers.</li>
<li>Check for Windows Updates and ensure all of the latest programs are installed to your OS.</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try performing a clean installation of the video driver set.</li>
<li>Update DirectX to the latest version.<br>
For details on how to update DirectX, please visit the Microsoft support page or Microsoft Download Center.</li>
<li>Add the game’s folder and files to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds\MonsterHunterWilds.exe</li>
<li>Add folder and files for Steam.exe to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
*Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe</li>
<li>Give administrator privileges to Steam.<br>
To run Steam.exe in administrator mode, right-click on the .exe file and select “Run as administrator.”</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try logging into your PC in administrator mode and then run the game’s execution file (MonsterHunterWilds.exe).</li>
<li>Verify the game’s files on Steam.<br>
To verify your game’s files, follow these steps:<br>
(1) Restart your computer and launch Steam.<br>
(2) From the “Library” section, right-click on the game, and select “Properties” from the menu.<br>
(3) Select the “Installed Files” tab and click the “Verify integrity of game files” button.<br>
(4) Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.<br>
Important: One or more files may fail to verify. The files that fail to verify are local configuration files that should not be replaced as part of this process. You can safely ignore this message. If problematic files were detected during this process, Steam will automatically download and / or replace those files.</li>
<li>Disable Compatibility Mode for “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” if enabled.<br>
(1) Right click on “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” located in the following folder:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
*The above is the default location.<br>
(2) Go to Properties<br>
(3) Open Compatibility tab<br>
(4) Untick “Run this program in compatibility mode for:”<br>
If the above does not resolve the issue, please disable the Compatibility Mode for “Steam.exe” located in the folder below.<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, please also try the troubleshooting steps on the Official Monster Hunter Wilds Troubleshooting &amp; Issue Reporting Thread posted on the Steam community page as they contain more detailed and additional steps that may help resolve your issue.<br>
*Some steps mentioned in this article is also mentioned in the troubleshooting guide below, but please try all the steps in the guide again.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Afterlove EP Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/afterlove-ep-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/afterlove-ep-review.1122096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/afterlove-ep-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There is only one thing truly certain about life, and that is death. One day we will pass on from this world, and we cannot know the day it will come for us. Accompanying death is grief – grief from the ones who love us and care about us. Grief does shatter you, remoulding you, and changing you. Sometimes that change is small and other times it is so significant, those around you do not recognise the person you have become. Afterlove EP is a game that explores grief following the death of a loved one, and how it can grip you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Afterlove EP - Date Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76BGWySi0C0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Afterlove EP has two central characters, though only one interacts with the wider world. Rama is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist for the band Sigmund Feud. He is also the character experiencing grief after the unexpected death of his girlfriend, Cinta. Cinta is not completely gone, however, and is the other central character. Her voice and memory is lodged inside Rama’s head, making comments and holding conversations with Rama. Rama can’t let Cinta’s voice go, having a knock on effect on his relationships with his friends. Sometimes Rama will have a conversation with Cinta, speaking his responses out loud which leads to confusion with his friends, adding to the strain as they struggle to follow what Rama is talking about.</p>


<p>The game is structured around choosing how Rama spends his day. There is an overarching time limit as Sigmund Feud has a gig at the end of the month, which could make or break them. The events of the game take place a year after Cinta’s death, and it is only now Rama is reaching out to his friends and bandmates, who have continued to live their own lives while Rama stayed in place. During the day, Rama can meet with people, do some busking, attend therapy, go to band practice. and wander around. To be honest, aside from finding photo locations to trigger memories, there isn’t much to do in this version of Jakarta when wandering about.</p>


<p>The band practice and therapy happen on specific days. You will get reminders for band practice, but for therapy you need to check the map and see if your therapist’s icon is showing up. The game is very much about people’s mental health and wellbeing, and not just Rama’s, though you will have the most insight with his. Going to therapy lets him unburden, while the therapist listens and helps him to process. Handily, I’m married to a therapist and asked to get her view on these interactions. Her verdict is that she would not have been so direct as Rama’s therapist is, but generally the representation was good but more counselling heavy.</p>
<p>Who Rama chooses to spend time also impacts the activities he takes part in. There is Regina, your friend Adit’s girlfriend, Mira who is Regina’s friend and a poet, and Satria who is works in the record store. Hanging out with Regina will focus on her life as a model, and the issues she is facing there. Mira will recommend you books and ask for help with a poetry show, while Satria jams out with friends in the park and invites you. All three are romance options too, though it seems very strange to have a friend’s girlfriend as an option as a love interest. Mira and Satria both have their own qualities, if you want to pursue those romances.</p>

<p>There has been an artistic decision in Afterlove EP to have Cinta as the only voiced character, outside moments when Rama is singing. This has the effect of making Cinta’s views much more prominent, even if she is a figment of Rama’s memories, drowning out the other characters. The voice acting is fine, though it can be a little too doting toward Rama.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, music is a major part of Afterlove EP too. There is a rhythm based game tucked in here, as well as a minigame where you choose lyrics while busking. The rhythm game is fine, though it is not always obvious which notes your inputs are corresponding to, and sometimes inputs will keep coming along the track even though the song has stopped.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Afterlove EP has bugs and I was even softlocked out of continuing when getting close to the end. First, on a lot of scenes Cinta’s lines would flash up on screen, she would start to speak, and then the line would just auto skip so quickly that her voice would cut out and you wouldn’t have time to read it. Considering how the core focus of the game is about relationships and impact of choices, this is not a great thing as you lose context.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are presented with the purpose of managing relationships, but outside of a few conversations, you are a passenger as Rama gives his own responses. More player input to explore different ways the story could go would have been welcome. The softlock came when I had to have an important conversation with Mira. This task flagged up during the morning period of the day, but I couldn’t progress because I had nothing to do that could advance time. You can only speak to Mira in the evening at the bookshop, and I could not talk to anyone else, busk or do anything to move time forward to have this conversation. I searched high and low for Mira to no avail. I had to stop the game there as my last manual save was a couple of hours back, and the autosave loaded into this task with the same result.</p>

		<p>In a roadmap update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, 11 bit studios has revealed that the console port of their post-apocalyptic city builder is planned for release this summer.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 roadmap now has three major landmarks on it with fairly well defined time windows. 8th May will see the first free major content update that will make adjustments to the City’s management, before the console port arrives at some point in the summer. There’s then an autumn target for the Spectrum DLC.</p>


<p>Further away is two more DLC packs. The Aurora DLC is still expected this year, while the untitled DLC 3 is coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from 11 bit:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>May 8th</b> – A day to be remembered: a <b>Free Major Content Update</b> that will adjust the City’s management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners.</li>
<li><b>Summer</b> – A grand undertaking: the <b>Console Port</b>.</li>
<li><b>Autumn</b> – Reaching the <b>Spectrum DLC</b>, which may help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…</li>
</ul>
<p>They also hint that fans of these gritty city builders should keep an eye out for a seventh anniversary celebration of the original game on 24th April.</p>
