		<p>Sales of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> did not initially seem good. In&nbsp;Square Enix’s May 2024 financial report, company president Takashi Kiryu stated that PS5 sales of <i>the game “</i>fell below expectations”, making players worried about the third and final chapter of the game.</p>
<p>Worry no longer as director Naoki Hamaguchi has spoken and said that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will be of the same standard. Speaking to Automaton he said “The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/01/30-upcoming-pc-games-for-2025/">PC</a>. I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment.”</p>


<p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely,” he adds. “A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.”</p>
<p>“For new players discovering Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 or Xbox Series X|S, I’d love for you to first enjoy that experience, and then also play the second game when it launches, while anticipating the third instalment,” he concludes.VII</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 has yet to get an official title and does not have a release date, but if it has the same sort of development length as the first two chapters, it should be out in 2027.</p>

<p>We scored the second title a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">winning 9/10</a> in our review.&nbsp; “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love,” said Nic. “It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Your choices for ethical gaming are getting slimmer by the day as it looks like EA is the next big video game firm to be swallowed up by the gigantic Silver Lake Management, which is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Also taking a stake will be Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, you may recognise that name as he is Trump’s son-in-law.</p>
<p>News of the takeover surfaced Friday afternoon, causing EA shares to surge 15%, valuing the company at around &nbsp;$48 billion. Nothing has been finalised as of yet but the deal could be announced as early as next week and would be one of the biggest industry takeovers of the year.</p>


<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund already owns 10% of Electronic Arts and&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">all of Niantic</a>., It also has stakes in Riot Games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Activision Blizzard</a>, Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Take Two,</a> Capcom, Embracer, Nexon, and <span data-complete="true">Koei Tecmo. The fund has earmarked $38 billion to be invested in video game companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Electronic Arts had a poor start to the year as sales of their annual football game were lower than expected, but things have bounced back with “better-than-expected contributions” across its portfolio. The general consensus from previews is that their next game, Battlefield 6, is going to be very good and should sell well.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/27/tokyo-game-show-day-two-anime-rabbit-girls-uncle-death-and-canned-goods-reign-supreme/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As this is my first trip to Japan, I really had no idea what to expect. With a cultural knowledge based on anime and Yakuza games, that’s probably made me ill-equipped for the safe, respectful and utterly down-to-earth culture I’ve found in Chiba. Nobody has run up to me on the street demanding a brawl, nobody has screamed about an incoming Kaiju, and it’s almost like the real world is not like video games and TV shows. Except that Tokyo Game Show isn’t normal.</p>
<p>I interviewed a man in a rubber mask today. While I’ve been here, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/27/let-it-die-inferno-preview-uncle-death-returns-to-smash-up-the-roguelike/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> has been the focus of lots of my time – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/tokyo-game-show-2025-day-one-report-there-are-a-lot-of-games-here-and-one-of-them-electrocuted-me/">see yesterday’s electrocution</a> – and Gungho and Supertrick Games conducted the interviews for it with one of the development team embodying the iconic Uncle Death from the series. This didn’t so much derail my brain as it sent it charging down a side track into a disused station, but it was surprisingly informative, even if I wondered whether I was about to embark on my own journey into hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today was the day I didn’t get lost. Yesterday I tried to make sense of the Tokyo Game Show’s layout, and I came out utterly lacking. If you enter the show floor, you become trapped in the seventh circle of video games, unable to leave, but unable to move, and I started to see the same landmarks – the Nioh 3 demon, the Wizardry cosplay, the Inazuma Eleven stand – over and over again. Perhaps it was the copious amounts of free Red Bull, but I was utterly stuck yesterday.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Friday showed that I still have the ability to learn, and I was able to make sense, and make headway with the show floor. In fact, I probably got a bit too carried away, whizzing through neon booth after neon booth, and then couldn’t escape as they seem to have a wonderful habit of closing half the exits. Still, I have made it out, but I have now developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, longing once more for my captor.</p>


		
		

<p>Day two was more about discovery, and I bumbled across a bunch of games, starting with the impressive lineup in the Devolver Digital section. They’d created a setup like a traditional Japanese street with lanterns and wooden shutters – overall, I have to say that the stands here took what I’ve seen at EGX and Gamescom to a new level – and nestled amongst them I got to play Ball X Pit and Skate Story, both of which left me thoroughly impressed.</p>
<p>I then happened upon Tiny Metal 2, a sequel to a game that tried to fill the void caused by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo basically giving up on Advance Wars – let’s forget that in the meantime they vaguely remembered about it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars 1+2</a>. Tiny Metal 2, though, is what should happen to this genre, and it’s ramped up the grid-based tactics with a modern makeover and… well, that seems to be about it, but who needs anything more than that?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, TGS has proved the best place for catching up with folks in the industry, and I happened on a friend at the Polish games stand who’d led our cultural exchange mission to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/how-katowice-in-poland-is-aiming-to-become-a-global-gaming-industry-giant/">Digital Dragons in Krakow earlier this year</a>. TGS isn’t just about Japanese development – far from it – and it’s attracted exhibitors from across the globe. It would be interesting to know just how well imports perform in Japan, since this is a nation at the foundation of the modern game development scene, but the exhibitors I talked to all agreed how positive, dedicated and enthusiastic the crowds were.</p>
<p>Based on the number of free bags I saw, the star of TGS 2025 has been Ananta. This upcoming free-to-play game certainly looks cool, but it’s also hard to argue with a giant, neon green rucksack, emblazoned with an anime rabbit girl. It was so big, I saw plenty of punters struggling to know what to do with it, and I swear I caught people in the act of trying to get in there themselves. Oversized bag aside, Ananta is one to keep your eye on, especially as it’s covering all bases with mobile, PC and PlayStation releases.</p>
<p>The importance of mobile to the Japanese gaming scene has surprised me, and there were a host of mobile-only titles with big, main hall stands that have clearly got the budget and the backing to make a serious dent in other people’s wallets. It feels far more like a legitimate part of the gaming landscape here than it does in Europe, and it’s well worth remembering that gaming doesn’t start and stop with consoles and PC, especially when our phones can pump out things like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The end of yesterday produced one further surprise in the shape of the canned goods bar. This is a bar where you grab a tiny shopping basket – like one you’d give to a three-year-old to play shopkeeper with – fill it with canned goods, and they’re then dispensed cold to you as a bar snack while you drink a craft beer. This was weird enough, but the fact that Spam sat happily amongst the bespoke produce as a culinary delight was the point I decided it was probably time for bed.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Game Show has proved to be an incredible celebration of the Japanese and international game development scene. The end of this year, and then on into 2026, looks like it will bring a cavalcade of great releases, and, as ever, Japan remains at the centre of that. I can only hope that I get to cover TGS again in the future, as I’ve never found a safer, more welcoming and more engaged show in all the years I’ve been writing about games.

		<p>If you call your game Let It Die, you’re sending a clear message to your players. The thing is, the first Let It Die game – released all the way back in 2016 – probably did want you to die, because its free-to-play business model meant that if you died, you could pay real-world money to revive yourself.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, that didn’t really catch on in a wider sense – imagine if Elden Ring charged you each time you died? – but it caught on enough that Let It Die is now entering its 32nd season and remains one of the most unique FTP titles we’ve ever seen. It’s little surprise then to herald the arrival of its direct sequel, Let It Die: Inferno, but this is now a roguelike that’s taking everything good about the original and turning it into a full-price premium game. A Let It Die game without the microtransactions? That’s definitely worth talking about.</p>

<p>Roguelikes weren’t really all that popular back in 2016, so in some ways, the first Let It Die was seriously ahead of its time. Given that pretty much everything is a roguelike now, it feels as though Let It Die: Inferno is coming out at the perfect time, ready to hoover up all the more recent fans of the genre. Producer Shin Hideyuki told us, “Absolutely, this was the best time for it. In the original game, it had the concept where if you die, it’s over. And that concept in this game is even more pronounced. Death is still something that’s kind of taken lightly because the more you die, the stronger you will become, but it will still be an over-the-top, overwhelming death.”</p>
<p>We didn’t get to see all that much narrative framing through our hands-on, but given that the original was largely centred on you being at the whim of the idiosyncratic Uncle Death, that’s probably all the motivation you need. Uncle Death himself – or at least a member of the team who was wearing the rubber mask – told us, “He’s going to be making appearances in the game in that aspect. So, the electricity you experienced yesterday [they strapped me to a machine that electrocuted me when I took damage] was all him, and anything you see in the Let It Die world is probably his idea. In many ways, this is the game made for Uncle Death and, sort of, by Uncle Death if you will.”</p>


<p>That’s all getting a bit meta, but what is clear is that the team at Supertrick Games are thoroughly set on embodying and imagining the game that its iconic frontman would make. Given that they spun off from the original Grasshopper Manufacture devs, and that the follow-up Deathverse: Let It Die took the franchise into a creative cul-de-sac, it’s not all that surprising that they want to be true to the original ethos of Let It Die. Through our hands on, that seems to have been achieved with plenty of success.</p>
<p>While you still begin the game with a spot of character selection, Let It Die: Inferno sees those choices become more curated, and the ‘Body of the Day’ basically has you choosing between different builds with different starting stats. Through our demo, Timothy has balanced stats and healing skills, while Pearl specializes in offense, and has skills that can break through enemy defenses with ease. In action, Pearl certainly had the upper hand in our playthrough, so much so that I accidentally make it all the way to the boss without levelling her up, but one of the team members reassured me that death at any point is a good thing.</p>
<p>This being a roguelike, death is the point of the game. As you die, you can turn some of the accumulated experience or currency into permanent upgrades, meaning that the next time out, things are going to be easier, and you’re going to make it just a little bit further. They’ve also retained a flavour of Deathverse: Let It Die with a Battle Royale-like system that sees you fighting against a clock, trying to make as much progress and then escape before the area becomes utterly toxic to your character.</p>
<p>The team told us, “This time you have escape pods that are inside the levels, and they’re placed randomly through every run. You have a time limit in which you have to reach these escape pods to get out of the level. You might just completely luck out and get an escape pod right near you. So that is just good luck, but there are times where you will absolutely not find one, and in those times it is definitely going to be very challenging.”</p>

<p>The roguelike framing for Let It Die: Inferno feels like it’s stronger than ever, and that fight, that rush to collect experience within the time span, just works incredibly well. I really wanted to push the boundaries, and after my death to the first boss, all I wanted to do was jump back in with another run. That bodes very well.</p>
<p>After the last game’s short-lived success, it was clear that the team didn’t want to repeat the same mistakes, but there were still important lessons to be learned from it. They told us, “In Deathverse, the previous title, we couldn’t have PvE – it was more PvP – so that’s something we wanted to include. In Let It Die: Inferno, we’ve managed to put in the PvE aspect while retaining the PvP aspect from Deathverse that players liked.”</p>
<p>That sense of legacy, and that sense of continuation, runs very clearly through Let It Die: Inferno. The combat, the inventory management, and the overarching setup remain absolutely recognisable, but this is the 2025 reimagining of that original vision. The visuals are fantastic – as you’d expect with a jump in generations and the shift to Unreal Engine 5 – and there’s a newfound vibrancy and energy to the game which wasn’t there before. That unique weirdness, that Grasshopper Manufacture flavour, is still here, but it’s been refined and reinvigorated for the modern day.</p>

<p>The key improvement is the game’s shift in business model. From all of the people I’ve spoken to about Let It Die, it’s clear that the number one turn-off was its free-to-play setup. It was clearly an inviting and hardcore roguelike action game – not quite a soulslike, but certainly a challenging hack and slash – and its gameplay loop was perfectly paced to draw you in. It was when it started asking you for money as you died that many players switched off. Hopefully, players will remember just how much fun the combat was and buy into the idea of Let It Die: Inferno as a full-priced title. On early impressions alone, it’s well worth the asking price.<br>
