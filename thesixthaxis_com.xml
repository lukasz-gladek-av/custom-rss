			<p>It has been a while since I’ve played a game that has been styled on the classic look of games from the Game Boy era, and one that captures some of that experience too. The most obvious and repeated comparison is to the classic Pokémon games, but The Edge of Allegoria is not a game for kids and doesn’t have you capturing creatures to fight for you.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Edge of Allegoria - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZm_VTFuGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is crude, full of sexual references, and a load of swearing. Your character is a bit of loser who ends up wandering Allegoria completing quests for not always appreciative people, learning of the plight of Allegoria that is living under the shadow of an evil god and his generals, though most of these enemies seem to keep to themselves in their bases.</p>


<p>Before facing off against them though, your character will face off against all sorts. If you can think of it, it is probably in the game as an enemy or closely resembled. Want to fight a crow? Sure, you can fight a crow. How about deer? Yep. Nymphs? So many. Witches, vampires, ninjas, samurai, djinn, tengu, demons, zombies, succubus? Yep, yep, yep. They are just some of the approximately 150 enemies to fight against.</p>


<p>Combat in The Edge of Allegoria looks an awful lot like the classic Game Boy Pokémon, but instead of creatures, you’re the one doing the fighting and your success is all dependent on the weapons and equipment you buy and find. As you use weapons and equipment, you will gain mastery of them. This mastery boosts your character’s base stats while unlocking also different attacks.</p>
<p>You can have a maximum of five moves to use and it is advisable to regularly change weapons and moves to figure out the best tactics for you. Some moves inflict status effects including poison, burn, bleed, drowsiness, stiffness, and mad. Poison and burn deal damage over time, while bleed, drowsiness, and stiffness can impact defence, attack, and agility. Mad boosts all your stats, except accuracy which drops significantly. There are also moves that allow you to counter attacks and guard against them too.</p>
<p>The overall combat is decent enough, but you will need to stock up on items as you will experience so many status ailments in fights. If you are not prepared, some fights that should be easy will become a challenge to pass.</p>

<p>There is a fairly basic story in The Edge of Allegoria, which centres around a falling out between gods, and one group making you a champion as you are an Anomaly. The quests of the game tackle all sorts of adult themes, including murder, suicide, drug use, and sex fetishes. There are a ton of quests just on the main route, plus a number of smaller side quests to complete with many being fetch quests. Most of these rely on enemies dropping the right item, so prepare for some fighting!</p>
<p>The world design is fine, though there were quite a few times where it was not clear what needed to be done next, leading to some aimless wandering until stumbling across a progression point. There is one dungeon near the end that has you teleporting around rooms, but there is no map to use so you have to make note yourself of where the portals are taking you, eventually finding the boss room. Another dungeon had a lot of doors to open, and the game even comments on this with the main character getting frustrated at it. It is frustrating.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2025 – #25 to #21]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-25-to-21/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-25-to-21.1075764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-25-to-21/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re into the top half of our Most Wanted games of 2025, and there’s a mix of the familiar and the new in this selection of five. Co-op is a strong factor here, whether it’s sharing in the horror, taking on the latest soulslike experience, or surviving in an MMO with your buddies.</p>
<h2>25 – Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares series has quickly felt like a staple of the horror genres, bleeding an unsettling setting and creepily oversized enemies in alongside puzzle platforming. Original series creators Tarsier Studios have moved on to create their own fresh take on this style with Reanimal, but Little Nightmares 3 is continuing on with Supermassive Games at the helm – another studio with a rich pedigree in horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oSzWzliENs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows, with this game looking to emphasise full co-op. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first two games, it is set in a completely different location, as Little Nightmares 1 and 2 were both set in The Maw.</p>

<h2>24 – Greedfall 2: The Dying World</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC (out now in Steam Early Access)</em></p>
<p>Here’s one you can actually play already, with Greedfall 2: The Dying World currently going through PC Early Access on Steam. To say that this release has divided the fans of the original is a bit of an understatement, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set well before the events of the first game, Greedfall 2 looks set to explore the same world from a new perspective. Now you’ll play as a Teer Fradee native, witnessing the early impact that colonisers from the Old Continent have on this verdant land, before being dragged back to the old world as the story unfolds. What’s much more significant, though, is a complete shift in gameplay style, moving away from action RPG and back towards something more reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins. Combined with the ropiness of an early access game, the initial reception has been mixed, but we’re keen to see how it comes together through its full release.</p>
<h2>23 – Sniper Elite: Resistance</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with Sniper Elite: Resistance, a spin-off story that puts Karl Fairburne’s longtime co-op buddy character, Harry Hawker, in the spotlight. You’ll be sneaking through large levels, silently taking down patrolling guards, sniping from hundreds of meters away (to trigger the series’ iconic X-Ray killcam), and working your way through a variety of missions behind enemy lines in Occupied France.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hands on Sniper Elite: Resistance – Harry Hawker takes aim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LODts4M4BPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">hands on with Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> at Gamescom this year, saying, “Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>
<h2>22 – Elden Ring Nightreign</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 2025</p>
<p>FromSoftware aren’t making an Elden Ring 2, but they are working on a spin-off from their smash hit. Elden Ring Nightreign is a more specifically co-op game than before, mixing up the visual style, combat and general setting of Elden Ring with a new format.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While you can play Nightreign solo, it’s intended to be played with a group of three, working together across multiple in-game days to prepare for a final boss. There’s a little dash of battle royale thrown into this as well, with the playable area shrinking after players defeat a minor boss at the end of each day, limiting the second and third day as you get closer to that final encounter. An interesting twist on proceedings.</p>
<h2>21 – Dune: Awakening</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Early 2025 (PC)</em></p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games are popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening – Survive Arrakis Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S-l7NySFsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>
<p>There’s no defined release date yet, but Dune: Awakening will have betas before launch. That launch will also be split, first coming to PC before consoles arrive at a later date.</p>
<p><em>That’s this set of five, and we’re getting towards the pointy end of our list. What here takes your fancy, though?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During Sony’s CES 2025 conference, the company announced some new film and show projects it has begun working on. The key announcements were projects based on Helldivers, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p><iframe title="CES® 2025 Press Conference｜Sony Official" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV95SMpTW-M?start=2327&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima Legends is an anime that is being produced at Crunchyroll, with the basis of the series being the Legends mode of the game. The Legends mode was added in 2020, bringing a co-op multiplayer experience to the samurai game, with four new warriors being made playable and each representing different classes. These were the Samurai, Hunter, Ronin, and Assassin characters who were tasked with working together to deal with supernatural situations. These stories are likely what the anime will be using as inspiration.</p>
<p>When it comes to the big screen, Sony had two major reveals. Both Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting movies. Sony has partnered with Columbia Pictures to make the Horizon Zero Dawn movie, though it is yet too early to know who will be playing Aloy and when it will be release. This follows on from the news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/">Netflix’s Horizon Zero Dawn show</a> had been scrapped in July. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, though again there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>
<p>The next<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/16/until-dawn-movie-has-a-release-date-for-april-2025/"> big game based movie coming out is Until Dawn</a>, which is set to be released in cinemas this April. Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said,&nbsp;<em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>
