		<p>Close to one year on from the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">Cloud Streaming beta</a> for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, Sony has announced the official launch of this feature, as well as the debut of being able to stream your own games. All you need is a PS Portal and an active PlayStation Plus Premium subscription.</p>
<p>The update will arrive overnight tonight at 2AM on 6th November GMT, or 6PM 5th November on the US West Coast.</p>


<p>Cloud Streaming of your own games lets you stream from Sony’s servers instead of using Remote Play with your console. This has been shown to have some better performance, which seems daft in certain situations, but comes down to the server architecture having been optimised specifically for streaming. By incorporating your digitally owned games into this, it means titles such as Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, and Resident Evil 4, which are not in the PS Plus library can be streamed.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that this can open up new multiplayer possibilities, such as having another player on your PS5, while you stream from the cloud. It also makes the experience of using the PS Portal away from home better and more reliable – no more remembering to leave your PS5 in standby or telling other family members not to use it.</p>
<p>For a full list of streamable games, visit <a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">here,</a> where Sony has constructed a really annoying layout with a search bar, instead of just making a list.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the system software of the PS Portal has been given an overhaul.</p>
<p>The refreshed UI presents three options when booting up – remote play, cloud streaming and a cloud streaming search – and cloud streaming now has a dedicated UI. There’s also 3D audio support for streamed games, a passcode lock, and a network status screen for finding a good connection. When you’re in a game, the in-game stores now work, there’s better accessibility options specifically for when streaming games, and game invitations arrive on a system level as well.</p>
<p>All around, this seems like a great update, so long as you have a PS Plus Premium subscription.</p>

		<p>Valve has added a feature to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> that you might be surprised wasn’t there all along: Display-Off Downloads. Now, the console can download games with the screen off, entering a new low-power download mode before going to sleep upon completion.</p>
<p>This new mode is now in the Beta and Preview channels of SteamOS, and will be rolled out to all users eventually. At that point, it will be the default mode when the Steam Deck is plugged in to power, and can be enabled when on battery power manually under Settings &gt; Power.</p>


<p>If you’re downloading a game or updates at the time that you press the power button to turn off the Steam Deck, it will prompt if you’d like to continue downloading with the screen off. It will also enter this mode automatically after being idle for some time. While downloading, you’ll be able to check on downloads by waking the screen, and can fully wake or let it continue.</p>
<p>When using this with battery power, the Steam Deck will halt downloads and go to full sleep if the battery drops below 20%.</p>

<p>Display-off downloads are similar in concept to the standby mode downloads and updates that are possible on Xbox, PS5 and Switch, but with SteamOS being built on a branch of Linux, it’s much more like a PC in some of its workings. This is a good step closer to the console experience, when compared to needing to manually enable and enter more basic screen-off modes as with Windows-based handhelds, laptops and PCs.</p>
