		<p>Housemarque has released an update for the early PlayStation 5 hit, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, adding support for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that brings a higher resolution experience to players of the game.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the update, the PS5 Pro is capable of running the game with up to 2.5x the pixels of the game on base PS5.</p>


<p>Looking back at early analysis of the title, Digital Foundry pegged the game’s original PS5 release to having a native 1080p pixel count that was then upscaled through temporal reconstruction to 1440p, and a further checkerboarding pass to 2160p. Housemarque hasn’t put a firm figure on the new resolution targets, but with 1920×1080 delivering just over 2 million pixels, rendering 2.5x the pixels would put this around 5 million pixels, or an uncommonly heard of 1700p. Of course, this is “up to” and we’re dealing with dynamic resolutions throughout.</p>
<p>While it’s perhaps a little disappointing that Housemarque haven’t enhanced the game with a 120Hz performance mode – 120fps is generally out of reach for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/19/returnal-pc-15-february-release-date-minimum-recommended-specs/">the PC version of the game</a>, even – a straight up resolution bump still has plenty value for increasing image clarity and reducing the effects that temporal and checkboarding upscaling have on image quality.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/saros-is-the-next-time-looper-shooter-from-returnal-devs-housemarque/">Housemarque announced Saros</a>, their next project during February’s State of Play, which following in the footsteps of Returnal’s roguelike shooter form, starring Rahul Kohli as our player character Arjun Devraj.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/fortnite-will-premiere-star-wars-tales-of-the-underworld-before-it-airs-on-disney/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we build up to the yearly puntastic celebration of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> on May 4th this weekend, Disney and Epic have announced a new collaboration that, alongside a Star Wars-themed season coming to the Battle Royale game, will see Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld premiere first within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> before it airs on Disney+.</p>
<p>The first two episodes of anthology series Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld will be watchable on the Star Wars Watch Party island from 3PM UK time on 2nd May. It’s sure to be highlighted within the game, but the island code is 2124-6713-8076.</p>


<p>The island is another example of what’s possible within Unreal Editor for Fortnite, using official Star Wars assets that are available to other creators to mess around with in their own islands. The island features a battle arena where you can fight waves of enemies – there’s no damage in this mode, though.</p>
<p>Another freebie is a First Order Stormtrooper outfit, which can be unlocked by linking an Epic Games account with a MyDisney account.</p>

<p>As was recently <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">announced at Star Wars Celebration</a>, the next season of Fortnite Battle Royale is dubbed Galactic Battle and will kick off on 2nd May. During this event, players can play as Emperor Palpatine, pilot X-wings and TIE Fighters, and it will build up to an in-game event, Death Star Sabotage. Leaning in on the age old memes and jokes, you’ll also be able to play as Darth Jar Jar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Galactic Battle Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqTXd-YiAtk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s a pretty huge collaboration between Epic and Disney, who previously linked up in the days before the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019, hosting a film preview in-game that featured a message from Palpatine – a message that was mentioned in the opening crawl, but not heard by moviegoers.</p>
<p>“For the first time, Disney+ is premiering a show inside a game, launching alongside our largest Star Wars collaboration with Fortnite to date – giving fans and players an exciting first look at the kinds of experiences they can expect as we shape a new future together,” said Sean Shoptaw, Executive Vice President, Disney Games &amp; Digital Entertainment. “We’re building the next era of digital entertainment, where fans can play, watch, create and connect – and we’re just beginning to tap into what’s possible.”</p>
<p>What could leave an odd taste in the mouth, though, is that Disney are putting these episodes out there within a free-to-play game, putting that audience ahead of people who pay for Disney+. Sure, it’s only by two days, as the show will arrive on Disney+ on 4th May, but you’d be understandably a bit miffed if you were in the wrong part of the audience Venn diagram.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released Nintendo Switch system update 20.0.0 today, laying some of the foundations for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2’s release in June</a>. With version 20.0.0, the Nintendo Switch now has the new Virtual Game Card DRM system, support for GameShare, a system transfer utility for Switch 2, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-card-overhaul-for-switch-switch-2-digital-games/">Virtual Game Cards</a> are an overhaul for the way that digital game licenses are managed on Nintendo Switch systems, turning every purchased game into a, well, a virtualised game card. This system formally lets you load and eject games on an individual basis across two consoles, sharing out offline access in a way that was not possible under the previous system, as well as allowing you to lend games to other members of your Nintendo Account family group.</p>


<p>This does now remove the game sharing loophole of letting to people play from a single game license by using a Primary Switch for one person and then online authentication for the other. There is also a limitation that game cards can only be shared by a single used between two Nintendo Switch consoles, though an Online License check option is also available for those who own and use 3 or more systems with one account.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the unrelated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare feature is now added</a>. The Nintendo Switch 2 is able to share multiplayer games to other consoles in certain titles and situations, so all players can play on their own systems. This can be used to share back to the Nintendo Switch when playing locally, and is a Switch 2-only feature when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">sharing online via GameChat</a>.</p>
<p>And a new System Transfer feature has been added. This can perform a direct transfer from a Switch to Switch 2 using local networking, but for those who will be selling or trading in their Switch before activating a Switch 2, you will also be able to temporarily upload all your data to Nintendo’s cloud and have that downloaded to the new console.</p>

<p>Oh, and the News icon is now green and the eShop icon is now red, which will break the brains of anyone who was used to them being red and orange, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Nintendo Switch version 20.0.0:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.0.0 (Released April 29, 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following icons for new features have been added to the <strong>HOME Menu</strong>:

After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Nintendo Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2.</li>
<li>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
