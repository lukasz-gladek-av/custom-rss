		<p>The Pokemon Trading Card Game (TCG) Pocket team has released a new update on when players should expect new content to be released for the game. Since its launch, Pokemon TCG Pocket has had some new events that have introduced new card variants and other accessories, but no new packs. This will change when new booster packs are going to be made available by the end of the year. Then in January, Pokemon TCG Pocket will get trading, however this will be limited. How that will work is not yet known. You can read the full statement below.</p>

<p><em>To all of you playing Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket,</em></p>
<p><em>This is the Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Operations Team. First off, we would like to use this opportunity to thank everyone who waited in anticipation of the release, as well as everyone who has given the game a try. We are continuing to develop and operate the game so that everyone can enjoy it even more, and we plan to hold a variety of in-game events in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>Now then, today we would like to announce new content planned to be released in a future major update. To begin with, we plan to add new booster packs by the end of the year. In addition, we are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January, 2025. We are planning to gradually expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here. We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it. We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don’t forget to open your packs each day!</em></p>
<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world. The game first launched in New Zealand, before rolling out worldwide earlier this month.</p>
