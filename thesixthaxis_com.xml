		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> Content Update 2 is here, bringing another batch of tracks, vehicles and general improvements to the smash-happy racer. Of particular highlights are the eminently crushable motorhomes, and a working scrap yard!</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8srHD006lIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>An addition that will be a joy to fans of peak Top Gear – a TV show that famously loved destroying caravans in particular, if not motorhomes specifically – thoroughly crashable RVs are joined by the large American sedan, the Cardinal.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to take these racing around the Banger Racing dirt track in both oval and figure 8 layouts, but the showstopper is the Scrapyard demolition derby arena, which features large armed crane grabbers, and car crushers to deal damage. You can get grabbed and dragged along to your inevitable doom, which looks quite hilarious.</p>
<p>Aside from that, Bugbear has sought to bring more polish to the game. Certain kinds of collision and vehicle damage have improved, the Last Man Standing demolition derby mode has returned, and there’s a bunch of other quality of life improvements and general tweaks.</p>

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>
