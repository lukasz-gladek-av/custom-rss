<p>When you are not venturing out to find relics, you will need to manage the shop where prices need to be set, customer demands to be met, and make the shop look good. There are also over 100 shop and dungeon perks that will offer various buffs to the players too. The combat system will have four main weapons that players can switch between depending on preferred styles.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

		<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is out next year and we finally have a gameplay trailer. It looks a bit like Saber’s big hit, World War Z, but with a lot more humour and neon.&nbsp; You get to play as one of the Toxic Commandos and team up with your friends (cross-platform co-op is included) to send the Sludge God and his “horde of things-that-should-never-be” back to the underworld.</p>
<p>The game was scheduled for 2024 but will now be released next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Saber say “f you’re the kind of person who likes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddy-movie vibes and the over-the-top humor, action, and horror of classic 80s cinema, inspired by the legendary John Carpenter…</li>
<li>Teaming up with friends to face down hordes of monsters who want to eat your face…</li>
<li>An explosive cocktail of visceral FPS action and apocalyptic environments…</li>
<li>Upgrading your skills and testing new abilities against increasingly hardcore challenges…</li>
<li>Saving the planet against impossible odds…</li>
</ul>
<p>… then now’s your time to go commando!”</p>

<p>“It’s exciting to be collaborating on a new video game with Focus and Saber,” said John Carpenter. “Look, I really like shooting zombies. They keep telling me that they’re called ’the infected.’ Please. They’re ghouls, dude. They blow up real good and there are a ton of them. People are going to love this game.”</p>
