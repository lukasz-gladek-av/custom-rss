		<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A has quickly reached 5.8 million copies sold through its first week, making it the fifth fastest-selling Pokémon game of all time. Perhaps more interesting is that around half of those sales have come from Nintendo Switch 2 owners, showing just how strong the initial sales of the console have been.</p>
<p>Of the games that Legends: Z-A is lagging behind – as noted by <a href="https://xcancel.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267">games sales tracker Pierre485</a> – all of them are Nintendo Switch games – Scarlet &amp; Violet leads the bunch at 10 million in 3 days, Arceus had 6.5 million in 3 days, Sword &amp; Shield had 6 million in 3 days, matched by&nbsp;Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 has been the best-selling console of all time through its opening months, and with such strong early adoption, it’s natural that some of the keenest Pokémon gamers are also then making the jump, leading to that rough 50:50 player split.</p>
<p>You do have to wonder if some of the issues that plagued Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet hampered some of the interest for Z-A, with that game having significant performance issues on the original Switch, or perhaps being a “Legends” branded spin-off make this feel less essential than a traditional dual game release.</p>
<p>But, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is one of the biggest, most impactful gameplay shakeups to the series to date. Taking place entirely within Lumiose City from Pokémon X &amp; Y, the big shift comes with the battle system, which has been transformed with real time battles. There’s also now a day-night cycle with tougher battles at night.</p>

<p>Nic was effusive with his praise of the game, saying in our review, “Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a game that really holds your attention. The spiritual successor to Legends Arceus, it’s learned from the mistakes of the distant past and beautifully shows what city life is like in the Pokémon universe. I can see myself playing this for another hundred hours as I finish my Pokédex, shiny hunt and generally have a great time. This is easily the best Pokémon game on the market.”</p>

			<p>Improvisational theatre can be a bit hit and miss, depending on the direction the actors decide to take a story in the moment. At its best theatre can be a place that tells excellent stories across genres, while at its worst things can make no sense leading to disappointment. I was only half aware what to expect when lifting the curtain on Once Upon a Jester, and I was surprised from start to finish with the heart it has.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Upon a Jester - PS5 &amp; XBSX|S Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-nag8ey1qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once Upon a Jester follows Jester &amp; Sok, a couple of thieves from Dorp Town who come up with a plan to enter a theatre competition in an attempt to steal a diamond from the royal palace. To get into the palace, the duo first need to perform shows in three different towns and gain fifteen flower bouquets from each location. To get the bouquets, though, Jester &amp; Sok need to perform plays that will appeal to the crowd, picking up clues on how to do so by exploring the towns each day.</p>


<p>Each town is rather small and only has a couple of people to interact with per day, but speaking to them and looking around the environment gives you clues on what the people want to and don’t want to see. One day, they may be in the mood for drama but absolutely do not want music, while another day they will want a love story or action. Once you have worked out what the town wants, Jester can put together a poster with stickers, of which more are unlocked through the game, and then start the show with Sok.</p>


<p>There are only a few shows to unlock, but you can take them down different routes, picking options which correspond to the different genres. You might put on a play about a prince facing off against a dragon, but if the audience is looking for romance, then Jester will have to flirt with the Sok’s dragon instead of fighting him. There are some genuinely funny moments both on and off stage in Once Upon a Jester, and the whole game just brought a smile with its absurdity.</p>
<p>While the plays are the main focus, the moments off stage can be just as funny and it is almost like you are watching another play as minor characters get introduced. The story is pretty predictable but the journey is so earnest, warm, and humorous that that is not a big takeaway.</p>

<p>Once Upon a Jester looks a bit like a 2D cartoon show with all characters having different styles to them, and environments that look bright and colourful. Music also plays a huge role in Once Upon a Jester, with a number of catchy songs throughout that can lift your spirits. In some of the plays you will play music by having to press and hold a button for period of time. There are other actions in the plays too that are essentially quick time events, but these can be a bit hit and miss. However, the misses are also weaved into the narrative so if you mess up Jester will mess up on stage which can bring shows to a premature end.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Once Upon a Jester is surprising game for me and I do recommend it, especially if you are looking for something comedic and that is only a few hours long. It might be over rather quickly, but will stay with you for quite a while.	</p></div>
