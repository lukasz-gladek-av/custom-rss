		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for March&nbsp; 2025 have been announced and if you bought Dragon Age: The Veilguard just four months ago then you are going to be a bit miffed.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus March 2025 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be March 4th, and they will be available until March 31st.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sonic Colors: Ultimate | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched on October 31st 2024 with lots of positive reviews, including one from us which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">scored the game 8/10.</a></p>
<p>“The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware,” said Jason in his review. “It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>Since then EA have said the game failed to meet sales expectations and cancelled DLC plans, so it looks like they are trying to rake back a little more cash by getting Sony to pay for it to come to PS Plus.</p>

<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate is rather older and was released way back in 2021.&nbsp; We did not review it but has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-colors-ultimate/">Metacrtic score of 74 o</a>n PS4 so that sounds pretty good to me.</p>

<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is from 2022 and collects thirteen classic Konami Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games in to one pack.</p>

<p>Our retro expert Adrian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">reviewed the pack and it also scored 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a must for any Turtles fan,” he said. “The emulation here is flawless and the range of accessibility enhancements is very welcome. In fact, the treasure trove of behind-the-scenes content is worth the asking price alone. Sure, there’s a some ‘classic’ games included that won’t live up to nostalgic memories, but ignore the dross and you’ll have a blast with the near-essential selection of scrolling beat ‘em up TMNT goodness.”</p>
