			<p>It feels like a no-brainer for a collaboration between the creators of the Zero Escape and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/21/danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony-review/">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;games to just be the biggest, wildest death-game crossover imaginable. Yet, to the credit of both developers, they’ve spent the last few years instead collaborating on projects that explore refreshingly different genres and mediums while still retaining a lot of the creative charm that made their breakout works so memorable. The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy&nbsp;is by far the magnum opus of their collaborative game works as Too Kyo Games. Blending the wild flowchart-storytelling of Zero Escape with the bombastic and absurd mystery thriller antics of Danganronpa is incredible enough, but doing so within such a different frame of narrative and with such an addictive gameplay loop has resulted in one of the most memorable games I’ve played in ages.</p>

<p>The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy&nbsp;reminds me so vividly of what might be my favourite game, Vanillaware’s masterpiece <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/15/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review-ps4/">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>. Like that game, this is a story and dialogue-heavy game that almost borders on being a visual novel, but mixes in just enough environmental exploration and tactical combat sequences to keep you constantly engaged.You play as Takumi Sumino, a high-schooler born and raised in a domed city that, to him, is incredibly normal. When that normalcy is interrupted by a sudden monster attack, though, he’s whisked away to a mysterious school full of other high school kids, and is soon told by a strange talking blob in a fedora that they’ll need to become a team of blood-powered combatants to fend off monsters for the next 100 days.</p>


<p>Despite the game being set in a locked-down school full of a dozen teenagers who don’t know anything about where they are or why they’re here, this is very much not another Danganronpa. The characters, which are designed by the same artist from that series, certainly make it hard to brush that comparison away. My early favorite was Darumi Amemiya, a manic pixie emo girl who is genuinely convinced they are trapped in a death game and riles everyone up with her delusions. Her fourth-wall breaking shenanigans serve as an early and appreciated warning – the game is aware of the comparisons it’ll draw, and that self-awareness helps drive the story into a realm of true sci-fi mind-warping ridiculousness that easily eclipses almost every twist and turn from that iconic death-game franchise.</p>


<p>What I especially love is how smartly the story and our character’s circumstances fold into the gameplay with battles that play out in the style of Fire Emblem’s tactical grid encounters. In a lot of games like that, you’ll meet characters and almost immediately recruit them to your growing army. In The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, though, none of these characters want to fight at all. They’re scared, confused, and one of them is about to throw up. Instead of meeting new characters and immediately recruiting them, you spend a large part of the game slowly connecting with the other characters in your crew until each of them, for their own reasons, finally feels ready to join the battle and become a playable character. It’s a great touch that blends every aspect of the game without making one feel more important than the other.</p>
<p>Each of your hundred days of service in The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy play out in-game, just like the days ticking by in a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona</a> title. Some days will be focused on big narrative bomb-shells or battles against monsters, while other days let you freely explore your school-prison and do activities like training your skills or bonding with your favorite characters. Some of these days will also present you with major choices, which will lead to several different endings – literally one hundred endings, according to the creators of the game. I was never able to explore all of those, but just the path I took through the game on my own was full of so many twists, unexpected developments, false credits, and more that I felt spoiled by the end of my time with the game for how massive, winding and satisfying the story ended up being.</p>

<p>The battles, though. What I love about the combat in this game is that a lot of the encounters almost feel more like puzzles rather than brute-forced tactics battles. You fight on a small field where large groups of enemies come at you in very specific patterns. Figuring out the most efficient way to clear out those patterns each turn is a blast. On top of that, the game is so smartly designed in how it encourages you to stop overthinking things and just go all-out.</p>
<p>When a character takes enough damage, they can do a massive attack at the cost of dying right after it, but since characters come back after each battle and they gain additional additional experience and attack meter when you trigger these abilities, you’re encouraged to lean into this ability. The game wants you to shoot first and ask questions later, and it helps make each encounter go by just fast enough that it never feels like they’re getting in the way of your next story revelation.</p>

<p>The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy is so ambitious, and so absurd, and I had no idea what to expect from the game up until the very end – and sometimes didn’t even know if I was truly at the very end or not. It’s an accomplishment in storytelling that doesn’t force itself to re-tread the greatest hits from the games that came before it, but still incorporates so much of the same charm, mystery, and all-star writing that will make fans of those games call this one their new favorite.</p>

		The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy is a must-play for fans of tactical RPGs, sci-fi thrillers, and just high-quality incredibly well written games in general. It's a wild ride from beginning to end, and I'm still not even truly sure if the ride has actually ended or not.	</p></div>

			<p>When SNK was bought by the Saudi Arabian Electronic Gaming Development Company back in 2022, they reassured the general public that this would not affect the content of their games at all. It happened during a pretty tumultuous period of foreign investment funds and corporations buying their way into several gaming companies, so people were rightfully pretty concerned about how it would affect the legendary fighting game developer. After playing Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it feels like that promise from 2022 has been broken, draining away any chance of this game having a cohesive aesthetic or style. Beyond some interesting combat mechanics and a handful of promising new character designs, there isn’t a whole lot to this game that would make it feel like a standout hit, anyway.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW｜RONALDO vs. GANACCI ｜Round 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmLzs2kkz94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most memorable fighting games are often tied together not just by their tight gameplay or number of characters, but by a cohesive vibe that flows through every level of the game. The striking style of games like Skullgirls or Tekken speak volumes, but there’s very little of that in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Instead, each piece of the package feels plucked from an entirely different source. Some menus are sleek and stylish, while others are barebones and basic. Characters occupy such a wide spread of tropes and styles that there’s no way to understand what or where or when this game is unless you’re knee-deep in SNK universe lore. Plus, two of these characters are real life dudes – soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently playing in the Saudi Pro League and with a cloud of controversies that still hang over him, and DJ Salvatore Ganacci, whose links to the country can be seen with him being tied in with another of Saudi Arabia’s big sporting ventures, LIV Golf.</p>


<p>Fighting games have thrived on wild guest characters for ages now, but I can’t understand any of the reasoning behind these two picks. You would generally see a guest character dip into a fanbase or piece of media that is either tied closely to the game they’re cameo-ing in, or appeals to a fanbase that would be likely to pick up a new fighting game just for that character, but I can’t imagine that the fandom of these two men correlates at all to the competitive, nostalgia-driven fanbase of gamers who would care about a new Fatal Fury game. Even the soundtrack for the game is questionably convoluted – every stage song has been created by a variety of English and European DJs, but almost every song falls into an identical snooze-worthy beat that not only fails to match the vibe of their stages, but fails to sound good whatsoever.</p>


<p>There’s so much of this sort of uninspired or cameo-fueled content sprinkled throughout Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that it’s hard to appreciate the game on its own merits. Which is a shame, because there is some interesting stuff here. Much like the original game that this is a decades-in-the-waiting sequel to, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is a intricate fighter made exclusively for the freaks. The biggest example of that is the new REV system, giving each fighter an additional meter that fills and empties throughout battles depending on how offensive or defensive you behave. Rather than spending the meter to perform stronger actions, you can perform a variety of techniques like Rev Arts, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and Rev Guard freely. The catch is that they all increase your Rev meter when you perform them and going over 100% into Overheat disables Rev actions entirely and makes you susceptible to guard breaks.</p>
<p>The REV system is arguably the one universally approachable element of combat in this game – it’s easy to wrap your head around managing the meter, and it adds an extra layer of push-and-pull to combat that plays out like a way less convoluted version of the Grind Grid from Under Night-in Birth.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, though, is that it relies so much on these advanced techniques and systems that casual players and newcomers will likely struggle to tap into. Even with the Smart controls system that gives you auto-combos and easy one-button presses for a few techniques, there are so many other minute systems like feinting and braking and the numerous defence mechanics that will remain out of reach. The game thrives when it’s played at it’s highest skill ceiling, but when it’s being played at it’s lowest, it doesn’t spark nearly as much joy compared to flashier and more approachable contemporaries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There are some single-player modes in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that help add some casually-approachable content to the game. Arcade mode is a pretty simple piece of the pie, but Episodes of South Town is a much meatier single-player campaign experience. Each character gets their own story that plays out through textbox dialogue and a variety of fights you pick from via a map of the city. It’s nothing special in terms of writing, and a lot of the fights are against random non-playable mob characters. Still, it’s enough of a consistent loop that it does give you a more engaging reason to do a bunch of casual battling in the game beyond just endlessly hopping into online play.</p>

		Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.	</p></div>
