		<p>Codemasters has released a batch of content for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> that is inspired by F1 The Movie, which recently released in cinemas worldwide.</p>
<p>The F1 The Movie content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>


<p>In addition to this, those who have bought the Iconic Edition or upgrade prior to July 11th will get to race as APXGP and as its two fictional drivers Sonny Hayes and Joshua Pearce, in Career Mode.</p>
<p>Of course, drivers in this game need to have a rating, and even though Brad Pitt is older then most team driver pairings combined – excluding Ferrari with Lewis Hamilton and Aston Martin with Fernando Alonso – he hasn’t missed a beat as Sonny Hayes.</p>

<p>“Collaborating with Apple and Warner Bros. has enabled us to create a unique experience, allowing our players to not just watch, but live the movie,” said Gavin Cooper, Creative Director of F1 25. “The blend of cinematic film content and the interactive gameplay blurs the line between real, fictional, and virtual worlds, creating a one-of-a-kind, authentic Formula 1 moment that only EA SPORTS could deliver.”</p>

<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>
