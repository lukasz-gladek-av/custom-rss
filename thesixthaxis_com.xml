		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hardcore mode is now available, with this mode adding new features to the game along with upping the difficulty. In the first game, things like the compass were removed to make navigation more immersive but in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s hardcore mode Warhorse Studios has gone further.</p>

<p><em>“We only kept a couple of the first game’s perks, and then we made new ones to provide a completely new challenge. It’s not just about making the game harder either, it’s about making it more immersive too. “</em><em>In the first game’s Hardcore Mode, we did things like disabling your map position and removing the compass, but we’ve gone further this time. We’ve added the option to ask different NPCs about your location in the world, which is something more immersive. You can run into travellers on the road and ask for directions,”&nbsp;</em>said Karel Kolmann, the senior game designer at Warhorse Studios.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will have to select at least three permanent negative traits at the start of the game, with some of those including Bad Back, Somnambulant, and Hangry Henry. Bad Back reduces the amount of weight you can carry, Somnanbulant makes you sleep walk and wake up in random locations, and Hangry Henry makes you want more food than usual.</p>


<p>In our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, Gareth said, <em>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues to fulfil the uncompromising vision of the first game. It weaves together a world of lords, knights, peasants and bandits in medieval Europe, with poor Henry of Skalitz caught somewhere in the middle just trying to cope. It’s grand in scale whilst being full of fine details and it sometimes gets in its own way a little bit, but if this is your kind of game it’ll be one that you don’t want to end because there’s nothing else quite like it.”</em></p>
