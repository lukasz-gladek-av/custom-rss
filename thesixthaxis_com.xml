		<p>Larian has revealed a new game in their homegrown Divinity fantasy setting, and it’s called… Divinity. </p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLdPSg1Cn-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals what the giant statue teaser for The Game Awards was all about, revealed to be The Hellstone, a transformed totem after a good old fashioned wicker man fertility festival goes a little bit wrong. Well, a lot wrong. </p>
<p>So what type of game will Divinity be? Well, the Divinity series has bounced back and forth between different genres since its creation in 2002. It started off as an action RPG series, before the barmy left turn into grand strategy (with dragon riding) in the form of Divinity: Dragon Commander, and then back to turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>This will be the seventh game in the Divinity franchise, following on from Divinity: Original Sin and Original Sin 2 which they created through the 2010s. Both games were incredibly well received, a part of the revival of top-down CRPGs that we saw with the rise of Kickstarter, but the studio made perhaps the best decision they possibly could when snagging the license to create Baldur’s Gate 3. That game&nbsp;Larian’s reputation into the stratosphere when it launched in 2023.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 was our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/game-of-the-year-2023-baldurs-gate-3/">Game of the Year in 2023</a>, where we said, “Baldur’s Gate 3 also gets about as close to the traditional tabletop D&amp;D experience as is possible, leaning into the kinds of shenanigans that players love to get up to. There’s plenty of things to interact with, there’s plenty of options available to you in a given scenario, and then there’s the chance and risk inherent in actions being determined by the roll of a die. That’s both when exploring the world and in combat, where players were quick to realise that yes, the game really will let you just fling enemies off ledges.”</p>

		<p>I didn’t know I wanted a game featuring a wise cracking badger in the world of Bloodborne and The Last of Us, but I do now. Bradley the Badger is the creation of Davide Soliani and Christian Cantamessa who have started a new studio, Day 4 Night.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bradley the Badger - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kp1IZuoAIB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game parodies game development and puts the titular badger in worlds based that parody hit video games such as a Cyberpunk 2077.&nbsp; Bradley himself is a parogy of video game mascots and he has “The Kit”, a set of tools that let him change the game world and himself.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine,” said Soliani. “And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future.”</p>
<p>“Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them,” added Cantamessa. “Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in.”</p>

<p>Bradley The Badger has only been announced for PC via Steam at the moment.</p>

		<p>After years of delays, Capcom has confirmed the release date for their astronaut and girl action adventure Pragmata. The game will launch on 24th April for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and… Switch 2! Oh, and there’s a demo out today for PC, coming to other platforms soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hugh the astronaut has popped over to the Moon to figure out what’s gone wrong at a big lunar base. After getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for the less catchy DI02367. The two form a fast bond, not least because Diana can hack the very angry androids with a quick puzzle minigame to enable you to deal damage. This new trailer shows off some big set piece moments that will push that concept as far as possible.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> earlier this year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. We finally have that firm release date, which is very nice, and PC players should check out the Steam demo.</p>
