			<p>The year was 2013, Lumoise was the city, and roller skates were all the rage. When you weren’t taking time out to ride a Skiddo across town, battle in a café or try out this newfangled Mega Evolution, you were doing tricks on your roller skates. Those halcyon days are long behind us. Pokémon X&amp;Y are ancient, nobody roller skates anymore and Lumoise is not the city it once was. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it is much, much larger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition — Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZL4jOPorLQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An urban redevelopment mission is underway with one core goal in mind: to turn the city into a place Pokémon and people can truly share. And boy have they done a lot – both to the city and to the game.</p>


<p>After getting off the train in the capital of the France-like Kalos region, you quickly see what the city has become. Back in 2013, Lumoise was a little more than two ring roads, with 10 ‘spoke’ roads reaching from the central hub to the rim. The geography is much the same in 2025, but buildings aren’t so much obstacles as they are your new playground. Much like in Assassin’s Creed, (almost) every rooftop is in reach. As long as it’s outside, there’s (almost) nowhere you can’t go.</p>
<p>This is important because the entire game takes place within the confines of the city. That may seem hair-raising, considering the number of biomes and regions seen in typical Pokémon games, but it really isn’t an issue. A few dozen hours in, and you’re still exploring new rooftops, catching new Pokémon and heading to newly converted patches of turf that have been given over to wild Pokémon.</p>


<p>These Wild Zones, as they’re dubbed, are essentially self-contained biomes, zoned off using holotech that keeps ordinary citizens out and wild Pokémon within. You can go in and catch Pokémon using the cool new dynamic battle feature, or you can leave them be. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>This dynamic battle system is very cool, shifting this series from turn-based battles to real time, where you actively run around and dish out commands to your current Pokémon. Rather than using traditional PP (stamina), each move has a cooldown. Transitioning between Wild Zones and the rest of the city is seamless, and you use the same system of attacks no matter where you are — whether that’s using Rock Smash on a boulder or Water Gun on an enemy Pokémon.</p>

<p>The battle system is nothing new in the wider scheme of things. It’ll be pretty rote for anyone who has played World of Warcraft, for example, but it’s new for Pokémon which has historically stuck to its guns on 1v1 battle systems where you and your Pokémon stand rooted to the spot. It feels, in many ways, like the boss battles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, but throwing moves instead of rocks.</p>
<p>But where things get <em>really</em> like Arceus is once night falls and the Battle Zones pop up. This is all part of the Z-A Royale — a letter-based ranking system to prove once and for all that you are, indeed, the very best, like no one ever was.</p>

<p>The Royale is a fun twist on traditional trainer battles, and as soon as you enter the zone, you’re fair game. Much like your Hisuian predecessors, this has you sneaking around like a ninja. The aim is to unleash an opening attack on a rival trainer and their Pokémon while literally crouching behind a bush, sign or bin. There’s none of this ‘When your eyes meet’ nonsense — this is brutal, all out backstabbery of the Pokémon kind. Not only is this fair game, but it’s actively encouraged by the app governing the tournament. You get missions to do this that give you bonus points. Get enough points and you can take on a Promotion Match to rank up.</p>
<p>Your opponents will tell you they’re taking part so that they can impose their own weird ideals and schemes on the city, like outlawing non-taxi based transport so they can monopolise urban mobility. But you’re an upstanding citizen (brutal backstabbery aside)! You’re in it to heal Lumoise, the city you only just arrived in!</p>
<p>Heal it from what, you might ask? Well, that newfangled Mega Evolution is no longer new. Everyone knows you hold a keystone, that your Pokémon holds a shiny marble that corresponds to their name and then you can unlock a form of temporary evolution that massively boosts their stats and gives them a cool new look.</p>

<p>What is new, and an emerging threat to this metropolis, is Rogue Mega Evolution. Certain Pokémon are evolving without the necessary stones, causing them a lot of pain and wreaking havoc. You have to end their pain by beating the tar out of them so they revert back to normal before they go on a rampage. It’s classic Pokémon logic.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s side missions! Pokémon fans are well known for being distracted by shiny things, and in this case, it’s missions given to you by the local detective agency – why would you do the main story stuff when you can cosplay as Detective Pikachu? There are dozens of these side missions scattered across the map at any given time, and they can be anything from a Pokémon-themed fetch quest to a battle request. They’re generally not difficult, but they offer some subtle guidance on type-based match-ups for newer players and unlocks new rooftops to explore.</p>

<p>But, wait, there’s even more! There’s parkour-based collectibles hidden around the city (Kalos gonna France), so you’ll be bounding around like some kind of Pokémon Ninja Warrior, there’s research quests to do and more. While you may not leave Lumoise, why would you want to when there’s so much to see, do, climb and catch?</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 manages to take all of this in its stride, and the game plays admirably well in both handheld and docked modes. That’s to be expected, but as we were only able to test and review on the newer hardware, there does remain a question mark over the game on the original Switch hardware, given the long-standing performance struggles of Scarlet &amp; Violet in particular, which the Switch 2 patch was able to effortlessly brush aside.</p>

		<p>With nDreams looking to revolutionise VR action games once more with the release of Reach on Thursday this week, and following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/hands-on-reach/">my hands on session with the game</a>, I had a chance to sit down with Glenn Brace, Head of the studio to chat about Reach and find out exactly why those death defying leaps don’t make you want to reach – aha! – for the sick bag.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Please introduce yourself and explain how you came to be working on Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> My name’s Glenn Brace, and I’m the head of studio for Elevation, and a living, breathing VR evangelist. Long story short, I’ve been in games devs for like 20 years but there’s only so many generations of platforms you can go through with the same IPs, so when VR arrived, that was for me the true next-gen. This is a new frontier, there’s new things. It doesn’t matter if you’re a mega studio or a little studio. The innovation is just there for the sake of it.</p>


<p>More recently, I wanted to get back closer to development, back to what is the best for VR. So nDream Elevation was born. The studio was created to look at the future, work on the sort of tech leading to VR innovation and where VR is going. We are the driving core tech, leading that core tech in the rest of the business. The rest of the business can use that and elevate themselves from that, but we are pushing that. We’re making the new stuff.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When we started the studio for this game, we started with the goal of reinterpreting action adventure for VR. That was the goal. We had a hypothesis, which was that we believe through one-to-one physical action simulation, you will have more immersion and therefore more presence. And more immersion presence means it’s more emotional. The more emotional games, the more memorable, the more fun. So, that was the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We set off and set ourselves a task, “Right, let’s discover one-to-one control and prove to ourselves if it truly is agency granting”. So, we tried different jumps, we tried running, how you fail and fall, what is the believability of you as a character. There’s so many metrics to discover.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Give me the Elevator pitch for Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Essentially, it’s action-adventure reimagined for VR. And the root of that is absolute agency-granting, second-to-second role play. What does that mean? That is a translation from the famous genres that we love, such as Tomb Raider. All those games out there that we’ve loved before in the past, but brought into VR, how does that work? We know there will be challenges doing it, but we’re going to fix those challenges and bring the essence of role play to that genre for VR. It’s run, jump, swing, fling. It’s action adventure in the true sense and giving that power to the player.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Where did the original idea come from? You mentioned Tomb Raider.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So it’s definitely an influence of what we’re trying to capture, but I think what’s really important about our game is aas a translation of the action adventure genre. So I wouldn’t go into it thinking we’ve made a Tomb Raider – we haven’t – it’s very much what needs to be, different. For starters going first person is in itself a big change. Historically, cinematics have played a large part in that genre, but we don’t want to break the immersion, so even the nature of that format needs to change.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> I played a good hour and a half and it felt like half the time, and not once did I feel any sort of motion sickness or dizziness despite all the running and jumping, how on earth have you managed that?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So, comfort was a big thing, and we set out to tackle that. One of the key factors of that was ‘FBA’, full body awareness, one of the key components. It’s not just to render the body and see it in game, although that’s cool, it’s that we have more than the tracking points. We simulate the wrist, the arm angle, we simulate the elbows, we simulate the body, the hips, the shoulders, the neck. When we have all that information, it makes things like mantling so much smoother and more reliable. That allows flow, it allows proper parkour, player-driven you’re-in-control flow.</p>
<p>That extends into jumping as well. If you get a motion that you’re not in control of it can send you over the edge. So for jumping, you actually move your arms as if you are about to take leap in real life to start the jump in-game, and this fools your body in to thinking your are actually doing it.</p>
<p>Another natural thing is when you jump over an edge, you look where you land, you look down, and you can tune the arc of the land specifically on that tight pillar. It feels natural; you do it in a very natural way. So, again, it’s more comfortable. Suddenly, we’ve got a level of parkour and jumping platforming that is super cool.</p>
<p>We also simulate body mass and weight, and that comes back to how you play traditional platforming. Once you familiarize yourself with your body mass and weight, how you use it, you can become skilful in platforming, and therefore in control. When you put those things together, the realization of it, the sense of weight, the sense of mass, the physics of it, the aftertouch, you’ve got a new experience in VR.</p>
<p>One of the goals I always wanted, and I always say this, was to make someone role-playing act in the interest of self-preservation. Faced with a giant leap, will you stop and think, “I’m not going to jump on that. No way. I’m going to do this”? In a standard game you’d do it anyway, you will die, start again, do it, die, start again. We wanted the players to be in the moment and think, making them prioritise their sense of survival in that world.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> So, given that every action adventure game these days gets a TV show or film, who would direct the Reach movie?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Well, I can tell you, not Michael Bay! We started Reach with the idea that it’s going to be action-packed, but the reality is the emotions and the moments, they’re a lot smaller, a lot more contained. So, I think it’s a more intimate experience now than when we first set out. So, I need to find a director that’s kind of in touch with the emotional side. Who did the Star Wars film everyone really liked?</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Rogue One? Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Yeah, I’ll go with Gareth Edwards. He did also Monsters which could have been a big loud film but it was actually quiet and poignant. So, yeah, I would go with Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Glenn for speaking to us about this fascinating project.
