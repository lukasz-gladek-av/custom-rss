		<p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil Showcase for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming this week, airing on Thursday 15th January at 10PM GMT. For those of you outside the meanest of timezones, that’s 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 11PM CET, 7AM JST (16th Jan).</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase tamely promises “<span dir="auto">brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem”, which definitely sounds plausible to me, but what new details are there to know? And how delicately will Capcom have to avoid getting too spoilery?</span></p>
<p>We already know a decent amount about the game. This ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft who is sent out into the field to investigate murders at a spooky hotel… which also happens to be where her mum was murdered.</p>
<p>Back at the game’s announcement, Capcom talked up having a new character who wasn’t so well versed in handling the horrors unleashed into the world. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/">As Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>But then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">they’ve made Leon a playable character anyway</a>! What this means practically is that Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, and Leon gets to do all the fun gun-slinging action stuff.</p>
<p>There’s also rumours of another returning character as well, and Capcom do have a tendency to throw in a random multiplayer game mode with their Resi games. I guess we’ll see if those appear in this showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.</p>

		<p>Whatever you might think of Disney’s handling of George Lucas’ sci-fi universe, it’s clear that we still can’t get enough of Star Wars. From the premiere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> at 2025’s The Game Awards, to the appearance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-10-to-6/">a little earlier on this list</a>, the future of a galaxy, far, far, away, seems assured, and certainly so with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> making it to number four on our list of 2026’s most wanted games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can stick your Cal Kestis lightsaber swinging, and your Sebulba-bashing pod-racing, Zero Company is Star Wars by way of XCOM. By that virtue, this is a tactical, strategic series of skirmishes through the darker, more serious side of Star Wars, with a turn-based combat style that will feel familiar to fans of games like XCOM, Baldur’s Gate 3 or Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>


<p>Coming from Bit Reactor, with support from Respawn and Lucasfilm Games, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi padawan. Your team is led by Hawks, a former Republic officer, who pulls the Zero Company together to complete a series of shadowy missions that look to have huge implications for the Star Wars universe. Quite how that plays out in terms of fitting into the wider canon, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p>


<p>The team at Bit Reactor have said that they want decisions to feel important, but that might be more to do with the customisation options for your characters and tactical choices on the battlefield, rather than overly impactful narrative moments. Either way, it’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the wider Star Wars universe from a new perspective, and there’s a huge range of possibilities with this period. Maybe you’ll complete a mission alongside Rex? Or come up against Maul as he works his way towards his takeover of Mandalore?</p>
<p>Bit Reactor definitely have the chops to pull this one off, not least because they’re a team made up of former XCOM alumni. XCOM, and its sequel, remain the benchmark for tactical strategy, so that bodes extremely well for Star Wars Zero Company’s gameplay, and with the XCOM license seemingly encased in Carbonite somewhere within 2K’s IP dungeons, this could well be the spiritual successor that fans have been waiting for, dressed up in one of sci-fi’s best and most beloved universes.</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is coming to PS5, PC and Xbox Series consoles in 2026.</p>

			<p>Taking the medieval sandbox simulation of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a> from the sprawling continent of Calradia to the high seas wasn’t the sort of pivot we had anticipated, but that’s exactly what Bannerlord’s first major expansion, War Sails, brings to Mount &amp; Blade 2. In tandem with a new Nordic-inspired playable faction – the imaginatively named Nords – comes a web of new systems and maritime mechanics that greatly expands Bannerlord’s naval gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cHCArYAehU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> has tried to implement sea battles in its flagship series though previous attempts have been surface level at best with the modding community also taking a punt here and there. War Sails offers far more, however, introducing a whole new dimension to what is already a dense simulation known to hook players for hours on end. With that said, just how well executed is Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord’s hotly-anticipated expansion, and how does it enhance the core game, if at all?</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon booting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/22/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review/">Bannerlord</a> after installing the DLC is a new start-up screen allowing you to select either the base version of the game (complete with your existing save data) or War Sails. It makes sense to separate the two as War Sails features its own campaign, an updated map, and the removal of online multiplayer.</p>
<p>One of the biggest improvements between Mount &amp; Blade: Warband and Bannerlord was the inclusion of narrative elements that helped enrich Calradia and its factions by introducing a more traditional RPG-like quest system instead of relying on players to stitch together moments of emergent storytelling. Although some series purists will prefer dropping straight into sandbox mode, the War Sails campaign offers a more immersive way to learn about Bannerlord’s naval warfare and ship management systems.</p>

<p>It begins in a similar fashion to the base game, casting players as a lone venturer, separated from their family. However, instead of heading inland to discover the fate of their loved ones, War Sails folds this key plotline into its own swashbuckling saga that has you taken under the wing of Nord sea captain in his hunt for the menacing Sea Hounds.</p>
<p>While we can certainly appreciate the effort that goes into writing a new story – complete with fully voiced dialogue – the exposition in War Sails tends to drag on. Bannerlord may be a much better looking game than its forebears, but investing in characters who are barely animated during conversations is a big ask, even if they do have some interesting tidbits of lore to share. After a few story missions I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue so I could get to the meat of the expansion: learning how to use ships.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s not a great deal to get your head around. Traversing the campaign map by sea is pretty simple – with one click you can go from point A to B, though you’ll need to be aware of enemy factions, as well as opportunistic corsairs, who will attempt to engage you in combat. Doing so will transport you to a self-contained battlefield where ships go head-to-head in simulated naval battles. However, where Mount &amp; Blade has always set itself apart from other strategy games is giving players direct command of their armies while also fighting amongst the rank and file.</p>
<p>Naval battles should introduce an exciting new way to play Bannerlord but, in truth, they all tend to follow the same tedious pattern as crews slowly engage and exchange volleys of missile fire before preparing to board. Throwing hooks and reeling in their target vessel, troops will quickly assemble rope bridges, pathing the way for confusingly frantic flurries of melee combat that only end when one side has been wiped out entirely.</p>
<p>You’ll quickly learn how to pilot your own ship, the simple controls allowing you to easily position yourself while raising/lowering the sails to adjust your speed, as well as setting all, half, or none of your crew to man the oars. Having fewer rowers will greatly reduce your mobility though it will increase the number of troops pelting nearby enemies with missile fire. Inevitably – unless trying your absolute hardest to avoid boarding actions – naval battles end with ships being drawn together in an awkward cluster and a messy albeit decisive mass brawl. This frames Bannerlord’s combat in its least enjoyable form: swinging and thrust in tight spaces where it’s difficult to make friend from foe. Overall, naval warfare lacks any kind of pleasing tactical variety though ship upgrades such as ballistas and better rams will at least make those opening moments of each sea battle a little more exciting. Thankfully, there’s always the option to simulate these skirmishes without needing to see each one played out in real-time.</p>

<p>What else does War Sails offer? As touched on before, Bannerlord’s existing Calradia map has been modified to accommodate for the expansion’s naval focus. Rivers and coastlines have morphed to allow for more opportunities to travel via ship with many cities now outfitted with ports where players can lay anchor, trade goods, and manage their fleet. There’s also a new Nord-controlled island to the north that makes for an ideal starting point from which to launch an invasion upon the mainland. As for the Nords themselves, like any faction they have their own network of cities, towns, and settlements, daubed with a Viking-esque aesthetic.</p>
<p>War Sails also adds three new maritime skills to Bannerlord’s existing lineup. These include Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, which each influence aspects such as sea combat prowess, fleet management, logistics, navigation, and ship upgrades. The requirements for levelling up these skills can be ambiguous and time consuming, though they do reward players who want to pursue a sea-based playstyle as well as those looking to enhance their land armies with naval capabilities.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There are some interesting ideas in War Sails but there’s a good reason why naval warfare was never a core part of the Bannerlord package. Sea battles just aren’t that appealing, lacking any kind of rewarding strategic depth or enjoyability. However, for those wanting a fresh way of tackling the campaign map, War Sails introduces new tactical opportunities and a layer of ship management some Bannerlord players will find themselves engrossed in. In short, this isn’t a must-buy expansion and for new players we’d recommend sticking with the base game.	</p></div>

		<p>Capcom may have spoiled their own surprise in a safety message for the new Resident Evil Showcase, which will be happening on 15 January 2026 at 10:00 PM (UTC) – which is 10.00PM GMT in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>The official announcement over on <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-uk/">residentevil.com</a> advises that you “Don’t miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem!”. That is to be expected as it is the next game in the series launching on 27th February 2026.</p>


<p>However, in the usual warnings for minors, the website also states, “This content will be age-restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content. Some of the games included in the show aren’t suitable for children.”</p>
<p>Did you spot it? <em>Games</em>. Plural. So that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and at least one other title.&nbsp; However, this may not be a new title, as it is heavily rumoured that Capcom will be releasing previous Resident Evil games on Switch 2 on the same day that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches.&nbsp; A few years ago, rumours circulated about a Resident Evil Zero remake for 2027 and a Resident Evil Code: Veronica remake for 2028, but no further information has been heard about those since.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | 15 January 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iBQXWfHPFvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In case you had forgotten, Resident Evil is also heading back to the big screen with the franchise getting a reboot this September. The movie will not feature any characters from the games and will be an original story set in the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>“It takes place in the world of the games,” Cregger explained to the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Double Toasted podcast</a>. “But most importantly the journey you’ll have as a viewer of watching this movie is going to be similar to the journey you have as a player when you play these games. And what that means is it follows one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>
