		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most anticipated games of the year, with Techland’s iconic zombie saga continuing to capture fans’ imaginations. That’s never been more obivous than today, with the game hitting 1 million pre-orders. In return for this incredible milestone, Polish developer Techland are dishing out a bunch of free gifts for everyone that has pre-ordered the game. It’s not too late though, as they’re extending this offer to everyone who pre-orders before the game’s launch on the 18th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What are these free gifts? The first is the APEX Car Skin, featuring a striking glow-in-the-dark design that the team says, “Makes every ride through Castor Woods unforgettable”, on top of the Hero of Harran Bundle. The Hero of Harran Bundle will be available from launch, while the APEX Car Skin will appear a couple of days later on the 20th of September.</p>
<p>That’s not all, though! Players who pre-order before the launch will also receive the exclusive Kyle Crane skin, inspired by his iconic look from the original Dying Light. This tribute will be fully revealed before the game’s launch and unlocked shortly after the game goes live. </p>
<p>We got to check out Dying Light: The Beast just over a year ago at Gamescom, and we loved what we saw. The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but it’s become apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms, that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>


<p>The game takes place in a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>
<p>We can’t wait for Dying Light: The Beast, and it seems like neither can most of you!</p>

		<p>Genshin Impact is introducing a brand-new bloom support with Lauma, an important character in the new Nod-Krai region, as she serves as the Moonchant Envoy of the Frostmoon Scion faction. She’s also one of the most mechanically interesting characters released so far, and allows for two very distinct support playstyles depending on what team she’s in. This makes her a little trickier to build, but we’re here to help.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Teaser - &quot;Lauma: Crown of Sacred Silver&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Lauma" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXRck6wMgyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Build</h3>
<p>Lauma changes up the bloom reaction and causes the cores to become lunar bloom cores. This, weirdly, doesn’t change anything at all about the reaction, unlike how Ineffa affected electro-charged. However, these new cores do generate something called Verdant Dew, which Lauma can consume with her skill to buff it, generate Moon Song, reduce enemy resistance to dendro and hydro, and then if she uses her burst, she’ll change the Moon Song into Pale Hymn. Pale Hymn allows the bloom reactions to be buffed by a portion of Lauma’s elemental mastery. That all sounds complicated, but basically you want to make the bloom reaction with Lauma, then use her skill, then burst.</p>


<p>One key thing to note here is that one of her passive talents changes her playstyle dramatically depending on the team composition. If Lauma is the only Nod-Krai character on your team, she’ll allow bloom, hyperbloom, and burgeon to crit, with a fixed rate of 15% crit rate and 100% crit damage. This stacks with Nahida’s C2, but only the crit rate. If there are two or more Nod-Krai characters, then Lauma will buff lunar-bloom damage. At present, only Lauma can do lunar-bloom damage though, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Weapon</h3>
<p>This is the simplest part of the guide. Lauma’s best weapon is her signature weapon, Nightweaver’s Looking Glass, which boosts elemental mastery by a lot, and also boosts bloom damage and lunar-bloom damage even more. However, you can use any weapon with a lot of elemental mastery with Lauma and still get a lot out of it. The best of these is the event weapon for this patch, the Blackmarrow Lantern, which does a lot of what her signature weapon does, but with lower stats.</p>

<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>While Lauma always wants elemental mastery, the specific stats you want differ with playstyle as above. If she’s the only Nod-Krai character, you’re generally going to want all elemental mastery pieces on her, albeit with a decent amount of energy recharge, usually in the 150% range. Her set for this build can be anything really, but both Gilded Dreams and Deepwood Memories are good options.</p>
<p>If she’s one of two or more Nod-Krai characters, then you’ll want to swap an elemental mastery piece out for a crit damage or crit rate piece, and you’ll want to go with the brand-new Silen Moon’s Serenade set on her. This set boosts energy recharge, and also boosts elemental mastery and lunar reactions as well, and it works off-field. This set is likely to be good throughout the region of Nod-Krai, so farming it and the other new set will serve you well anyway. With that done though, you’re ready to get out there and bloom with the best Lauma build you can find.</p>
