		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3’s</a> release set for October, Frontier has started to reveal some of the major new gameplay ideas and, even more exciting, the new species that are coming to the game. Introducing the Lokiceratops:</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Lokiceratops | Dinosaur Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkCPulJqhT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yes, the Lokiceratops was named after the Norse god Loki, but not (just?) because of how handsome Tom Hiddlestone was around the time this dinosaur species was discovered in 2019 – first found in northern Montana. No, it’s actually down to the distinctive horns that they have around their frill.</p>
<p>There’s certainly some similarities to the Triceratops, you might say, and just as with that iconic dionsaur, this late cretaceous species is a herbivore. They can live together in small groups along with herbivores and ceratopsids, teaming up to defend their young from any threats.</p>
<p>In Jurassic World Evolution 3, you’ll have to care for Lokiceratops in family units, ensuring that they have nests and have privacy to allow for breeding to take place between male and female dinos – none of this frog DNA to mess around with anymore. They’ll also just need plenty of space and vegetation to feel comfortable, so the ogling hordes shouldn’t get too close regardless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/jurassic-world-evolution-3-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches 21 October 2025</a> across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We’re four years removed from the last game in the series, which we award a stonking (stomping?) 9/10.</p>
<p>“Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original’s rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you’re a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn’t love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.”</p>

		<p>AI has taken over the world of Ra Ra Boom. This is an apocalyptic Earth, but not in the traditional Skynet style of decimation we’re used to. Instead, we meet our four heroes as they are sitting in a mundane, interminably boring classroom, safe in a sanctuary that looks like your everyday American high school. They’ve been selected, hand-picked even, thanks to their special traits, to train, practice and prepare for the return of the despotic AI and its minions, This quite conveniently happens just in time for the start of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Get Skippy Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysFzhw2cEJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.</p>


<p>And you get to smash plenty of robots. Ra Ra Boom brings the traditional batch of light and heavy attacks, as well as an Ultimate that you charge by successfully landing blows on those badniks. On top of that, each character has a ranged attack, guns and missiles destroying everything in their path, and giving you a great way to continue attacking while you close the distance to smash them up some more. Punches and kicks feel suitably swift, though I’d like to feel a little more weight to each blow.</p>


<p>The enemy are aggressive. These robots are hell-bent on putting you down, and even when you’ve taken many of the metal monsters out, they’ll resurrect, rushing at you with flailing limbs in a last attempt to deal you damage. It means you have to be ever watchful, and I’d definitely like to see some kind of finisher move to stop them from getting back up again. This is quality fisticuffs action though, and I really enjoyed the old-school thrills of walking left to right, hitting everything in my path.</p>
<p>It helps that Ra Ra Boom looks great. There’s a real America’s Best Comics vibe to the visuals, and each of the main characters is unique and vibrantly designed. I love some of the robot designs seen in the demo – particularly the massive single-eyed robotic boss character – and I can hope that the full game will showcase even more interesting designs and epic encounters.</p>

<p>My only current worry is that Ra Ra Boom is pretty tough, and some of that doesn’t always feel fair. Enemies can nab you a little too easily at times when you’re not expecting it, and there’s a running section where it’s nigh-on impossible to avoid the high-speed full-lane attacks that come your way, even though the path of the attack is laid out on the ground.</p>
<p>Ra Ra Boom has bags of potential, and as a fan of co-op action and classic beat ‘em ups, it’s definitely grabbed my attention. We won’t have to wait too long to see the whole game in action, as It’s set to launch for PC, PS5, XSX|S and Linux this August.</p>

		<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been announced been confirmed for PS5, and that it will be coming later this year. If the Xbox Series XS had a year’s exclusivity, then that release will be on or after November 20th. The PS5 version of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will use the DualSense features like haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. GSC Game World has also said that it will be developing PS5 Pro enhancements for the game, but has not detailed what these will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Official PS5 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since its launch, STALKER 2 has received quite substantial updates bringing a couple of thousand fixes to the game. Recently, update 1.5 was released with this adding the Three-Line Rifle and Kora Pistol. In addition, the update brought in mutant parts trading allowing you sell parts from monsters, which can be a lucrative trade to be in. The world has also been made more immersive with all characters in the zone having their own simulated lives, even when they are not in the player’s view.</p>

<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Miguel said, <em>“STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</em><br>
