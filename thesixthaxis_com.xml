            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-12th-february-for-40-minutes-of-ps5-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that their PlayStation State of Play showcase will return tomorrow, 12th Feburary, 10pm UK time – that’s 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and on 13th February at 7am JST.</p>
<p>The announcement is very, very light on what we might expect to see, but we do know that the show will be around 40 minutes long, and it will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5. The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world.”</p>


<p>And that’s all that they’re saying. Not even hinting at some of the publishers and studios that are taking part. Though we do already know one that will be there:&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-august-release-date-leaks/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date announcement</a>, which leaked last week.</p>
<p>The MGS Delta release date trailer – <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">viewable here</a> – was accidentally uploaded to the PlayStation Store, and the page listing temporarily hosted the game’s August release date as well. The trailer teased the returning Ape Escape tie-in mode, Snake vs. Monkey, just as was found in the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3!</p>

<p>Sony only mentions the PS5 here, and while that strictly speaking would include PSVR 2 games. The VR headset obviously requires a PS5 or a PC in order to play games, so there could be some VR titles featured or games that build VR compatibility in, but Sony don’t mention it here like they have in the past. So, I think we can safely expect that this will be pretty narrowly focused on PS5 titles. Hopefully there’s some first party bangers in there, like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-1-ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/09/insomniac-are-making-a-game-based-on-marvels-wolverine/">Wolverine</a> – which was first announced way, way back in 2021 – or something completely new and surprising.</p>
<p>Maybe Kendrik Lamar will turn up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak&amp;pp=ygUTYXBwbGUgaGFsZnRpbWUgc2hvdw%3D%3D">perform around the PlayStation symbols,</a> like he did on the weekend?</p>
