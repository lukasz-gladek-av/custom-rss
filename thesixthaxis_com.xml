		<p>EA and the Battlefield Studios group has fully announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the next game in the long-running first person shooter series, but they did so with a cinematic trailer while teasing a multiplayer reveal for next week.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal will take place on 31st July, one week from now. At that point we might also get word of a release date for the game – something which has been leaked/rumoured in the last few days to be coming in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From that, we can draw that everything within the announcement trailer was in-engine and more indicative of the single player campaign that is being developed by Criterion and Motive Studios. The trailer opens with an obscured President of the United States speaking from the White House podium about an unprovoked attack on Europe, the US and NATO by a private military group known as Pax Armata.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p>Witness the vicious path of destruction carved by Pax Armata, the world’s leading private military company. PAX pursues the destruction of NATO and its allies, stopping at nothing to uphold their motto: “Our Protection, Your Peace.”</p>
<p>Lock &amp; load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Little is known about who Pax Armata is, but from pre-announcement teasers, they seem to be backed by a growing coalition of other nations. Careful not to step on certain countries’ toes, this isn’t being labelled as a particular nation at this time, and is instead the “Pax Armata Mercenaries”.</p>
<p>Following this we get a look at a broad spectrum of Battlefield-like scenarios. There’s cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s clearly an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>
<p>The thing that has been most controversial, though, is whether or not weapons will be locked to classes or not. I guess we’ll find out about that in 7 days…</p>
