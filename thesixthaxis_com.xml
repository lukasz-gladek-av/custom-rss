		<p>We love Warhammer 40,000 here at TSA. There’s been a cavalcade of brilliant Warhammer 40K games over the past couple of years, and the Gorkamorka-based Speed Freeks definitely sits amongst them, with its multiplayer proving to be an absolute blast. In honour of Warhammer Day, developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced the arrival of the Deffkopta, a unique airborne vehicle that completely changes up the combat dynamic, while also bringing two new battlegrounds to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks Deffkopta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/csOxDI0YpZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Firstly, this is a free update, which is the way all things should be, and secondly, if you haven’t hopped into Speed Freeks already, it’s currently on sale on Steam with 55% off. I really enjoyed it at launch, and on its way to an 8/10 I said, “Speed Freeks is a perfect example of how smaller, more focused, multiplayer titles can find a place in the swollen games market. It’s all the better for losing its free-to-play status, and it deserves to find a committed community of players. Here’s hoping that it’ll find its way to console, as I think it’s a great fit for pick up and play action, especially for people who want to play online, without having to devote their entire life and personality to gaining access to the next tier league or justifying a battle pass purchase.”</p>
<p>“This new vehicle really changes the dynamic of the game”, said Chris Mallinson, Game Director. “And although it’s so different, it fits right in and complements the rest of the vehicles we’ve got. We’re pumped to see how players will use it, because it’s a hell of a lot of fun to even just fly around”</p>
<p>The two New Maps Battle are built for maximum mayhem. The first is Scrap In Da Yard, a Kill Konvoy map featuring vertical combat and a trench requiring expert driving skills to navigate. The second is Deff Gorge, the existing Kill Konvoy map “Da Gorge” gets a visual overhaul and expands its borders into a Deff Rally map.</p>
