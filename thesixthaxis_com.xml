			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a smashing good time. With Pauline clutching onto the fur on his back as the pair race to the centre of the world, you’ll be rampaging across the landscape of each level, slapping rock-encased enemies around, and dig-punching yourself in a gluttonous frenzy of screen-filling button mashing as you search for the moreish bananas that DK goes ga-ga for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review –&nbsp;Oooh! Banana!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA7cS_bLuLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s been an awfully long time since the last Donkey Kong 3D platformer –&nbsp;he literally only had Rare’s Donkey Kong 64 collectathon to his name –&nbsp;and gaming tech has moved on such that this is a completely different feeling game. Having experimented lightly with voxel deformation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Nintendo EPD Tokyo has now made this a core part of Donkey Kong Bananza, changing everything from how the world appears visually, to how DK can get around, and how you can transform the levels just by smashing stuff.</p>


<p>It’s utterly rambunctious stuff, letting you punch and smash through the world and enemies alike. You’ll feel a bit naughty as you do so. Should I really just be cutting a straight line to the banana-shaped sonar pulse? Isn’t there a hardworking level designer in Japan who’s shedding a tear because I’m ignoring the carefully designed, visually signposted path through to the next story beat? Am I not “breaking” the game by clipping the camera through the world and then filling the screen with shards of rock, gold, and glass as I hammer the punch and jump buttons?</p>


<p>In truth, this must be exactly what Nintendo intends. Arguably, just as with the chaotic messiness of Mario Kart World’s larger world and races, there’s some key areas here where Nintendo is giving in and accepting that this is just going to be a messier style of platformer. They’ve designed around that, ramping up the dopamine hits with more regular collectable Banandium Gems to find, more upgrades and costumes to unlock, more opportunities to branch off for another punch-filled frenzy, another challenge level, before returning to the main path and getting distracted again two seconds later. As intentional as this is, you can easily get lost in the underground button-mashing, the camera flipping back and forth between obscuring the world outside with a foggy haze and revealing it with a no clip-like view, and the tunnelling becoming overwhelming until you stop, take a breath and try to figure out how to get back outside.</p>
<p>As indulgent as the digging and deformation can be, DK still plays with all the natural, effortless control that you’d expect from a Nintendo platformer, it’s just that instead of that coming in the form of triple jumps, hat twirls and dives, DK’s movement is more about lumbering in a chosen direction, no matter what’s in the way. He can just clamber up vertical surfaces with ease, getting up and over in fast and fluid fashion, even if he’s holding a big chunk of rock in his hands, unless there’s spiked vines, lava or something slippery that he can’t grip onto. Add to that forward tumbles, unlockable skills like double jumping off a rock, and there’s a good deal of core 3D platforming to master.</p>

<p>And then there’s the Bananza transformations. Learned from the towering Elders that lead each underground animal tribe, Bananza transformations give DK big and bold new abilities. It starts with Kong Bananza, who’s basically just a bigger and smashier version of DK, but you quickly get Zebra Bananza for speedy running across soft surfaces other forms fall through, Ostrich Bananza who can glide and drop egg bombs, and goes on from there. Kong Bananza is the go-to form for much of the game, almost universally appropriate in combat, for souped up digging and when you need to get a bit meaner. The other forms are often better suited to areas and challenges designed specifically for them, and I rarely used them outside of that. Yes, the Zebra’s faster, but since I’ll need to recharge the Bananza meter once I’ve used this form for a bit, I might as well just rock surf or take a few extra moments to get where I’m going.</p>
<p>And where we’re going is deep down to the planet’s core in a race against the Void Crew. A trio of devious Kongs, they crash DK’s own mining operation down to a sublevel of the world, inadvertently pairing him up with what turns out to be a younger version of Pauline, whose powerful singing is what transforms DK each time. She’s the only English-speaking character in the tale, though her Bananza songs are gibberish and sound like a cross between Splatoon and Patapon’s Fever song. She’s a great addition, though, and while her motivations are still pretty basic, she adds a little more heart to the tale when DK’s just dreams about bananas.</p>

<p>She’s also there to provide the co-op mode, handing her shouting and control over transformations to a second person, whether locally using pointing or mouse mode, a second switch with GameShare, or online via GameChat. We’ve only tried out the same-console co-op. Her shouting manifests itself as rocks, but can also absorb other materials, and this works really nicely to support the main player. It’s an experience that lands somewhere between the co-op modes of Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey. Joy-Con 2 mouse controls also get a workout in the sculpting DK Artist mode available from the main menu, sculpting and painting.</p>
<p>As the pair journey on, heading to the planet’s core to have their dreams made true, they find that the Void Crew has cursed each level with some kind of plight, leaving impediments and enemies to get in your way. Combat brings us back to that almost mindless bludgeoning. Most enemies have got an outer shell made of one of the world materials, and this really highlights some of their interactions.</p>

<p>DK can easily clobber his way through soft sand to get to a golden enemy skeleton inside, but it will take a bit more hitting to get through stone –&nbsp;which means you need to watch for attack timing. But if it’s concrete, nasty spiky vines, or even lava, you need a different approach, ripping up chunks of harder materials out of the ground, throwing rocks or even explosive materials at them to bust through their armour. While that changes how you approach them, Donkey Kong Bananza does lean pretty heavily on these material variants of half a dozen basic enemy types. It does get a bit repetitive in that regard.</p>
<p>You also feel that with the boss battles. Some are just straight up punchathons that can last moments in a flurry of Kong Bananza’s fists, while others have a more traditional three-part structure, or are best tackled with a particular Bananza form. But you’ll face most of them two or three times as you work down the world’s levels, and I think that’s part of why a portion of the game’s final third felt a bit stretched out to me, in addition to the need to make more use of certain Bananza powers.</p>

<p>But on the whole, the game’s pacing and variety is great. For the more traditional stages, you start off at a round 100th level, reach a village or meet an Elder, and then branch off to tackle objectives that can take you one or two sublevels below, changing the tone, adding more challenge and variety as you go. But that’s not true of every layer, and there’s some great change of pace moments and environments that are wholly unexpected, beyond the variety of mini challenges that you find around each world. And did you say cameos? Yeah, there’s a few of those too.</p>

		<p>If you are a developer and you want to ground your video game in a compelling era of history, then the late Ming Period could well be for you. This was an era in Chinese history identified with great sweeping change, and the societal tension that accompanies it. Indeed, the potent series of crises – including the old favourites of ineffective leadership resulting in famine, rebellion, and war – that afflicted the Imperial Court were significant enough to bring an end to the near 300-year-old Ming Dynasty. But don’t take my word for it, take the word of Xia Siyuan, Co-Founder/CTO of Leenzee Games and Game Director and Art Director of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, a brand-new <a href="http://theixthaxis.com/tag/soulslike">soulslike</a> that sees the player taking on hideous mythical beasties, and a game that just so happens to delve into this historic setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wuchang: Fallen Feathers 2024 Showcase Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPf0b55ixE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“The late Ming Dynasty was a period filled with conflict, cultural richness, and philosophical tension…all of which fit the kind of story we wanted to tell” said Xia “The lands of Shu, especially in Sichuan, gave us a unique backdrop with deep historical roots and regional myths that many of us on the team grew up hearing. It offered the perfect mix of real-world texture and space for dark, imaginative storytelling.”</p>


<p>“Real historical events gave us a strong foundation. The turmoil during the late Ming Dynasty — especially the chaos in Sichuan during Zhang Xianzhong’s invasion — helped shape the atmosphere of collapse and unrest that runs through the game. We took those real moments of instability and layered in myth, using them to imagine how the world might have unravelled if something like the Feathering had taken hold.”</p>
<p>What is this Feathering that afflicts the land? Well, it’s a particularly cruel condition, one that causes the poor unsuspecting victim to sprout feathers from their limbs before ultimately going mad and transforming into a hideous monster. Lovely stuff, but where did the initial idea for this disease originate from? That’s what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>“According to existing records,” Xia dramatically intoned, “the Feathered People first appeared in the <em>Classic of Mountains and Seas</em>, and a significant number of unearthed artefacts also depict them. These relics, texts, and folk legends have all served as sources of inspiration for us.</p>

<p>“Many of the creatures in Wuchang draw from Chinese mythology, regional folklore, and ancient archaeological finds. We looked at stories about resurrection, spiritual corruption, and shape-shifting beings, then imagined what those myths might look like if they were warped by the Feathering disease. Sanxingdui relics, with their abstract, otherworldly designs, were a major visual influence, and we used them to help create enemies that feel both ancient and unsettling but woven into the world in which they live.”</p>
<p>If I wasn’t intrigued enough already, now my Indiana Jones senses were really tingling… ancient archaeological finds? Relics? Otherworldly designs? What exactly are the archaeological discoveries of Sanxingdui? Well, Sanxingdui is an archaeological site in modern Guanghan, Sichuan. Initially uncovered way back in 1927, it has since proven a treasure trove for bronze age artefacts, which archaeologists have attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Shu.</p>
<p>“The archaeological discoveries at Sanxingdui are a fascinating topic” continues Xia, “We’ve incorporated those elements not only into the design of certain bosses, but also throughout the environments and the story’s background. As players continue exploring, these cultural references will gradually become more prominent — eventually culminating in the ancient capital of the Bo people, where this unique cultural thread reaches its narrative peak.”</p>
<p>Sanxingdui excitingly consists of numerous sacrificial pits, which in total are crammed with over 13,000 relics, with more than 3000 items intact. This is mighty impressive, considering many of these artefacts are millennia old. My smart phone barely sees the year out before promptly self-destructing. Some of the relics uncovered depict half bird half man figures – human bodies transmogrified with feathers, wings and bird claw feet. It is these that proved the inspiration for the Feathering disease, and for many of the bosses that will repeatedly kill you until you get good.</p>

<p>“The game’s world, it’s actually set in a parallel timeline—one shaped by a small divergence during the time of Du Yu” explains Xia, “In this alternate world, the worship of the Feathered People and legends of resurrection have taken root.”</p>
<p>Which is all very well and good, but if players are going to fight hideous monsters inspired by the relics of an ancient mysterious culture, they’re going to need a range of weapons to dish out some damage, right? Well, don’t worry, Wuchang has you covered, with twenty-five brutal weapons to assist you in cleaving feathered wing from feathered body, like an overenthusiastic KFC chef.</p>
<p>“Several of the weapons are rooted in real historical designs from the Ming Dynasty, as well as legendary arms from Chinese mythology” begins Xia, “The Ming era was a transitional period in terms of warfare — moving from traditional cold weapons like swords and spears to early firearms and explosives. That shift gave us a lot to work with, both mechanically and visually. We incorporated these changes into the game’s weapon variety, blending grounded historical detail with mythological symbolism. Some weapons are stylised interpretations of relics from the period, while others are tied to specific folklore or spiritual beliefs, adding another layer of meaning to how they function in combat and within the world. It was important to us that each weapon felt like it belonged to the era, even if touched by the surreal or supernatural.”</p>
<p>Quite frankly, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sounds fantastic, the perfect game for lovers of history, mythology, and weird looking bird-dudes. Before I wrapped up my time with Xia, I wanted to know, what do the team at Leenzee Games hope players will learn about Chinese history, culture, and mythology through experiencing Wuchang: Fallen Feathers?</p>

<p>“Jiangkou sunken treasure, the Four Loyal Sons, Sanxingdui, the Jinsha ruins, Taoping Qiang Village, Baoyun Temple in Pingwu—these Sichuan landmarks and legends are part of the memories that shaped me and my team as we grew up. We drew inspiration from local folk culture such as the Sanxingdui relics, Sichuan opera’s face-changing, the iron firework ritual datiehua, as well as from Ming Dynasty philosophies—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism—and the evolution of firearms. All of these influences were woven into the gameplay.</p>
<p>Our hope is that these elements not only reflect historical authenticity, but also allow players to experience the unique cultural richness of the region. For us, sharing these memories and stories with more people is meaningful in itself—and we believe they’ll resonate with players.”</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feather is being published by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/505-games">505 Games</a> and will launch later this month on July 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p><em>Excellent news! The first Playing with History book – featuring over 100 games, 200 pages, and 10,000,000 years of history –has been successfully funded on Kickstarter. But don’t worry if you missed out on the campaign, you can still take part by proving a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past?ref=discovery&amp;term=playing%20with%20history&amp;total_hits=28&amp;category_id=35">late pledge, right now</a>! </em></p>
