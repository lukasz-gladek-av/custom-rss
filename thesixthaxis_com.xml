		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for January 2025 have been announced, and Sony has chosen to start off the new year with… well, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Also some games that weren’t commercial and critical flops.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 7th January.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most celebrated game here is The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, a game that’s all about&nbsp;office worker Stanley discovered all of his co-workers had disappeared and wandering around to try and figure out what’s going on. All his actions (as controlled by you) are narrated by the Narrator, voiced by Kevan Brighting, in humourous ways as Stanley encounters weirder and weirder scenarios. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expands upon the original game with more content, choices, and secrets. The graphics have also been updated to take advantage of newer technology. It’s a brilliant game and well worth playing, whether for the first time or revisiting over a decade on from its original 2013 release.</p>

<p>Another game from the remaster/remake pile is Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered. This was the first game in the series helmed by Criterion, and it really showed off that studio’s arcade racer chops in style. Back in the day on PS3 and 360 it was only at 30fps, but with the remaster, the game’s running at a much better feeling 60fps. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/">review</a>.</p>


<p>And that brings us around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Released after years of delays, it failed to hit the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p>The game was one of the biggest flops of 2024 – probably neck and neck with Sony’s own Concord – and has recently been included in Steam sales for just £3, while Warner Bros. and Rocksteady have confirmed that its seasonal content will be ending <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">as soon as its pre-announced 1 year content roadmap has completed</a> with an update in mid-January. On the positive side of things, they’re patching in an offline mode, and PS Plus subscribers will be getting the game at its most content-filled…</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
