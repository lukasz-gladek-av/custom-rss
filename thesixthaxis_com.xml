		<p>I’ve had a lazy week. Not in terms of juggling childcare and work through the school holidays, but in my gaming. First, I’ve been reviewing the slow-paced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a>, quietly enjoying being a Hobbit and making meals to enchant the townsfolk. After that, I went straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a>, beginning the careful task of farming, trading and finding a wife while working with gaming’s cutest cows. I have played a couple of things to raise the heart rate – though they were mainly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/playdate-2025-review-a-handheld-hero-thats-in-love-with-gaming/">Panic’s Playdate</a>, which I’ve made a regular stop-off on my weekly gaming.</p>

<p>First up this week was <strong>Jason</strong>, who polished off some more Monster Train 2, fully unlocking the clans and then beating the titans down as well. He also told us, “I’ve also been playing Final Fantasy XV, which I’m really enjoying revisiting.” Which is only right, because it’s the best Final Fantasy since XIV and before XVI.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> played Neverwinter Nights 2 and Peglin for review, as well as some Animal Crossing, Burnout Paradise and a bit of Planet Zoo, while Ade played the superb bullet-heaven Achilles Survivor for review, saying, “it’s great fun!” He continued, “I’ve also been on with Doom: The Dark Ages which is fantastic, maybe my favourite of the modern Dooms, though I’ll need to reach the end to know for sure. Finally, I played the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance so so good, roll on release day!”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been playing the Fantasy DLC for Two Point: Museum. She says, “It’s been great to have an excuse to revisit my favourite Two Point game (as if I needed an excuse!). I’ve also been playing more of Islanders: New Shores – did I mention it was addictively relaxing?”</p>

<p>It should tell you everything about the latest expansion that <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has given up on Destiny 2, swapping in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3</a> and Helldivers 2 instead.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing a lot of games for review, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> being the pick of the lot, but Heartworm and One-Eyed Lokhi aren’t far behind. He told us, “I’m near the end of the surprisingly emotional Chibi-Robo like Misc: A Tiny Tale and enjoyed the first few hours of Wuchang once I got the performance stable on PC. Add in a couple of playtests and that’s my week pretty full with gaming.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had a busy week, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/birdigo-review/">Birdigo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/atomic-owl-review/">Atomic Owl</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/dear-me-i-was-review/">Dear Me, I Was</a> for review. He says, “I have also played more Wild Hearts, hunting some kemono. I did have a bit of a dumb moment where I was tasked to hunt a particular kemono so I fought one, beat it, waited for the hunt to complete, but it didn’t. Because I’d followed the wrong monster. Oh well, I got some crafting materials.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> was our man with boots on the ground at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/hands-on-battlefield-6-so-are-we-back/">Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</a>, and alongside his preview, he said, “The more I think about it, the more optimistic I am for Battlefield 6. So long as it’s not too buggy at launch, the gameplay, balance of classes, the setting all speak to the best of the series from the early 2010s.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>
