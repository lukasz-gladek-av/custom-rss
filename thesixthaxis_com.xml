		<p>The respected Jeux Vidéo Magazine have done something unusual, they posted some rumours about an upcoming game. They have done an investigation themselves rather than rely on a third party and the game in question is the currently unannounced remake of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, a title that has<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/29/edward-kenways-voice-actor-hints-at-a-black-flag-remake/"> leaked</a> on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>It seems like the remake, which will use Anvil Pipeline engine, is going to feature some fairly big changes. The most notable change will be the removal of all the modern-day sequences so we will not see Rebbeca, Shaun and the others. The modern-day plot, which worked really well in the first few games with Desmond, has gradually been sidelined and only appears as text in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Replacing it will be “a few extra hours of content” including content that was cut from the original release, such as parts of Mary Read’s story.</p>


<p>Gameplay is said to be closer to the RPG style of the more recent games with loot, stats for weapons, and a new inventory. The combat is is also said to lean more towards the style of the recent games. The map is the same size but will have more things to do, and modern systems mean there will be no loading screens when docking your ship and heading to land.</p>
<p>The report suggests the game will now launch in early 2026, probably March, which is a little later than previous reports. Ubisoft Singapore, Belgrade and Bordeaux are working on it, and some assets from Skull &amp; Bones may be reused to save costs.</p>
<p>Finally, we should not expect a remake of the same level as Resident Evil 2, but better than a remaster.</p>

<p>Ubisoft have yet to reveal the Black Flag remake, but it does seem only a matter of time.&nbsp; We gave the original release<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/10/30/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review/"> 9/10 back in 2013</a></p>
<p>“Black Flag is more than just a return to form for Assassin’s Creed, it is an overall improvement and probably the best game in the series yet,” said Gareth. “It has taken the gameplay of the previous games, refined it, and combined it with a huge open world that is packed with enough content to literally last for days. If you have ever wanted a proper pirate game, this is as good as it gets.”</p>
