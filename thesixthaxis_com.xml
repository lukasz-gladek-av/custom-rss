		<p>I hope you’re all ready for another hot weekend. Thankfully it’s starting off pretty nice and cool, but the Sun’s just about to start doing its thing and get the UK roasting. Not a weekend to be playing VR games, that’s for sure… Maybe go for a nice walk in Death Stranding 2?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> played “more Tainted Grail, 10 hours into Act 2 and still getting on great with it.”</li>
<li>And&nbsp;<strong>Andrewww</strong> got in some more Death Stranding via PS Plus. “What I don’t quite get just yet is that you have a bike, but the paths for some missions just seem impossible to drive, as the terrain seems too rocky to get through (getting to the port for the first time). And walking all that distance seems rather a drag. So, I’m still very early on, figuring out how to get around.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>
