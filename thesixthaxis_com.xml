		<p>Opening today’s Nintendo Direct, Shigeru Miyamoto announced The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, a sequel to the 2023 hit animated film that will see Mario and chums blasting off on a space adventure and taking some inspiration from the Super Mario Galaxy games.</p>

<p>All the original cast members are returning, so Chris Pratt is Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy is Peach, Jack Black is Bowser, and on and on. There were no mentions of any new cast members at this time, though we expect there will be some new additions to be revealed at some point.</p>

		<p>I’ve been away for a bit through the middle of the week, so I’ve got some gaming to catch up on. Having made a start on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants last weekend, and enjoying my return to this setting, the only real gaming that I got in while on planes was some Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots, which sure is Everybody’s Golf, with some barmy character story stuff thrown in for some reason. Got to play some more before I can drop a review, though. </p>

<p>All that Aran can say is that he’s played a bit of Ghost of Yotei, and since Nic’s family is apparently cursed to be eternally ill, all he can contribute is that he’s looking forward to Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p>So, let’s move swiftly along to Jim, who played some more of Sword of the Sea, and has found it rather soothing, if a bit lesser than it could have been. He was also happy to find Mortal Kombat 1 in the PS Plus catalogue: “I like how they’ve rebooted the MK universe with some notable changes to certain characters. I’m currently playing through the campa- sorry, Kampaign, and find it oddly refreshing how little blood and gore there has been though I’m pretty sure that will quickly change.”</p>
<p>With a new real job in his future, Tuffcub has vacillated between joy and dismay at having new work. He’s also started Metal Gear Solid Delta, and he’s enjoying it, but exclaims that “the cut scenes/talky bits make Death Stranding look reserved. They go on forever!! Should have done what I did with MGS4 and bought popcorn for these bits.”</p>


<p>It’s been Hirogami and Discounty on Gamoc’s review docket –&nbsp;“The Discounty trailer has a little jingle in it. I only watched the trailer once, I haven’t heard the jingle in the actual game itself, but every time I play it that jingle gets stuck inside my head again.” He’s also been playing a bit of Baldur’s Gate 3 on a PC that should not really be able to play it.</p>
<p>Ade’s been playing plenty more Marvel Rivals with Season 4 dropping around about now, and is looking forward to play as Angela. I’m out of the loop, so I assume that this is Angela Bassett? </p>

<p>Steve had intended to play a bunch of Silksong, but instead had to finish off some reviews. I’ll let him ramble: “I put 20 hours into finishing Lost Soul Aside and was underwhelmed throughout. It was clear that it had gone through several iterations throughout its complicated development history and never really took full advantage of any of them. I also put a few hours into Davy X Jones which is fun but I encountered a quest breaking bug which I’m waiting for a fix for before I write up my full views. It’s in Early Access so this isn’t unusual. Finally I’ve put Wuchang down for a bit as I am stuck on two different bosses and can’t make any progress without having the time to really devote to learning them. I’ve switched instead to checking out the feline Dark Souls game, Kristala which I’m enjoying a lot more (at least until I hit a difficult boss in that too…). Finally I went back to Breath of Fire II on a commute to Liverpool but could not remember what I was doing so had to restart it.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with Dom, whose nightly gaming tradition has become a bit of Mario Kart World, while he’s had Switch 2 Star Wars Outlaws, some Frostpunk 2 and some Grit and Valor on the go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Noble Fokus Amadeus Wireless Earbuds Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/noble-fokus-amadeus-wireless-earbuds-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the last year I’ve covered a dearth of different headsets, headphones and earbuds. One of the clear highlights has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/noble-fokus-apollo-headset-review-astounding-audio-with-an-astounding-pricepoint-to-match/">Noble’s Fokus Apollo</a>, one of the best-sounding pairs of headphones I’ve ever put on my head. Their latest, the Noble Fokus Amadeus, have a certain weight of expectation behind them then, and I had to wonder whether they could repeat the same trick with a pair of wireless earbuds. The answer is an emphatic ‘yes’, though, as with their other offerings, this sits well towards the premium end of the market.</p>

<p>In the box, you’re getting the Fokus Amadeus earbuds, a 42-hour charging case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable and a selection of eartips. On first impressions, the Fokus Amadeus are certainly eye-catching, with the bright red jewel-like design of each earbud an immediate visual highlight, and one which ensures that they’re not going to be mistaken for one of those boring bland earbuds everyone else is wearing. Everything feels like an event with the Amadeus, and every visual detail has been covered, right down to the Noble logo on the tiny metal speaker grilles.</p>


<p>Detaching the foam tips, it’s apparent that they’re a slight touch heavier and more substantial than some wireless earbuds you might own, though they’re only a spot larger than Sony’s WF-1000XM5, and smaller than the older XM4s. They feel rock solid, and the design and build quality reflect the premium price point.</p>
<p>The red jewel design is mirrored by the metal lid of the case, but this feels thin and lightweight in comparison to the earbuds themselves. It doesn’t scream quality, though the rest of the case is solid enough, but it’s a chunky thing to drop into your pocket, being considerably thicker than the case for the AirPods Pro 2 and the elongated case for the Bose Sport Earbuds that I also carry around with me – you might think I have too many earbuds considering I only have two ears, but I would disagree. It’s not huge – we’re not talking anything like the enormous Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 case – but it’ll definitely put a lump in your pocket. I took to chucking them in my bag.</p>


<p>The Fokus Amadeus is equipped with Bluetooth 5.4 and Active Noise Cancellation, boasting a battery life of 8 hours with it enabled, and 12 without. That’s right around the ballpark of other premium wireless earbuds, such as the newly announced AirPods Pro 3 or the Sony WF-1000XM5. It’s going to last you a whole day at work then, and with the 42hrs of charge from the case they’re a solid companion that’s unlikely to let you down when you’re ready to block out the world.</p>
<p>There’s a set of six different ear tips, with three standard tips, and three with dual fins for a tighter fit. The Fokus Amadeus need a twist into your ear to sit properly, and while I had no problem at all with the fit in my right ear, I had to test a few different tips to get my left ear to feel as solid as its partner. In the end, and in a first for me, I used a smaller eartip in one ear over the other, before finally opting for the largest pair of dual tips. It’s well worth taking the time to find the best ones, because the Fokus Amadeus reward you for your perseverance, but this is a pair of earbuds with a particularly pernickety fit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the touch controls aren’t as fussy, and while I do prefer swiping for volume rather than repeated taps, I soon got used to using the left earbud for volume and toggling ANC while the right looks after your music controls and Siri/Gemini. The most impressive thing is that they all work relatively reliably.</p>
<p>The accompanying Noble Fokus app includes Audio presonalisation, which means you get a hearing test before it provides you with a bespoke EQ setting for your ears. I have to say, I didn’t particularly like the curve it gave me for the lower frequencies, but the top end was definitely improved by its tinkering. You can, of course, completely override whatever it suggests, and though there’s a disappointingly slim selection of genre-specific EQs, you can completely customise the EQ so that it fits exactly where you want it to, with both a 10-band option, and an easy-to-parse three-point one.</p>
<p>The Fokus Amadeus is capable of dealing with most modern Bluetooth codecs, including two of the highest bitrate offerings we currently have access to – if your device supports them. I was interested to discover that my new Honor Magic V5 defaulted to using AptX Adaptive at first, before then more commonly connecting via LDAC.&nbsp;Both of these offer high-bitrate connections, and while you might find more detail with LDAC, AptX Adaptive offers lower latency, which might suit you if you’re going to do a spot of mobile gaming along the way. If you’re an Apple user, you’re going to be stuck to AAC or SBC, so you won’t be getting the best out of them at all.</p>

<p>With lossless audio, the Fokus Amadeus sound stunning. The amount of detail their custom-made triple-layer diaphragm drivers are capable of reproducing will make you wonder just how much you’ve been missing listening to music elsewhere.</p>
<p>While I did eventually check out Falco’s Rock Me Amadeus sounded with these earbuds – you’d have to, wouldn’t you? – it fell to my current heavy rotation track, Specter by Bad Omens, to really put the Amadeus through its paces. This soaring slab of emotional metal opens with plaintive piano and a host of reverb that the Fokus Amadeus picks through with care, creating an enveloping soundscape that brings Noah Sebastien’s vocals to the fore, grasping every nuance of this melancholy opening before ripping it apart with chugging guitars and heavy beats. If you’ve got the fit right, I love the rounded and well-balanced bass delivery here, but it’s almost too easy for an earbud to slip out of that sweet spot. My most enjoyable listening sessions with the Fokus Amadeus were static, at home.</p>
<p>I’ve got a full playlist of songs I like to use to review headphones and headsets, and after playing some Death Stranding 2, I’ve found myself drawn back to the music from the first game. That means that Don’t Be So Serious by Low Roar stood out as one I had to try out with the Fokus Amadeus, and its multiple instrumentation types and multi-layered soundscape were an ideal fit. The earbuds’ wide soundstage made it feel as though there was plenty of room for each different instrument, and the precision of the Fokus Amadeus meant you could pick out and focus on each part, even in a busy environment. Seriously, there were elements of this song I’d never heard before that the Amadeus brought out.</p>
<p>It’s all aided by the inclusion of active noise cancellation. It does a good job of removing background sounds from your listening experience, even if it’s not quite as powerful as the ANC you’ll find in Sony and Bose’s top-tier audio products. A recent train journey was ably dimmed, allowing the music and the odd episode of Kaiju No.8 to shine through, while walking around town with an audiobook cranked up proved that the Amadeus was capable of more than just delivering excellent audio.</p>
<p>At $320/£279.99, the Fokus Amadeus are putting themselves right amongst the world’s priciest earbuds, and in terms of audio and build quality they absolutely deserve to be there. However, their fit remained idiosyncratic throughout my time with them, something which I’ve never struggled with while using the Sony WF-1000XM5s and AirPods Pro 2s. If you’re looking for the best ANC though, then you’re going to want the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, which tune out the world to an incredible degree.</p>
