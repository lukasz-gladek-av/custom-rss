		<p>We’re into the top half of our Most Wanted games of 2025, and there’s a mix of the familiar and the new in this selection of five. Co-op is a strong factor here, whether it’s sharing in the horror, taking on the latest soulslike experience, or surviving in an MMO with your buddies.</p>
<h2>25 – Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares series has quickly felt like a staple of the horror genres, bleeding an unsettling setting and creepily oversized enemies in alongside puzzle platforming. Original series creators Tarsier Studios have moved on to create their own fresh take on this style with Reanimal, but Little Nightmares 3 is continuing on with Supermassive Games at the helm – another studio with a rich pedigree in horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oSzWzliENs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows, with this game looking to emphasise full co-op. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first two games, it is set in a completely different location, as Little Nightmares 1 and 2 were both set in The Maw.</p>

<h2>24 – Greedfall 2: The Dying World</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC (out now in Steam Early Access)</em></p>
<p>Here’s one you can actually play already, with Greedfall 2: The Dying World currently going through PC Early Access on Steam. To say that this release has divided the fans of the original is a bit of an understatement, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set well before the events of the first game, Greedfall 2 looks set to explore the same world from a new perspective. Now you’ll play as a Teer Fradee native, witnessing the early impact that colonisers from the Old Continent have on this verdant land, before being dragged back to the old world as the story unfolds. What’s much more significant, though, is a complete shift in gameplay style, moving away from action RPG and back towards something more reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins. Combined with the ropiness of an early access game, the initial reception has been mixed, but we’re keen to see how it comes together through its full release.</p>
<h2>23 – Sniper Elite: Resistance</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with Sniper Elite: Resistance, a spin-off story that puts Karl Fairburne’s longtime co-op buddy character, Harry Hawker, in the spotlight. You’ll be sneaking through large levels, silently taking down patrolling guards, sniping from hundreds of meters away (to trigger the series’ iconic X-Ray killcam), and working your way through a variety of missions behind enemy lines in Occupied France.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hands on Sniper Elite: Resistance – Harry Hawker takes aim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LODts4M4BPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">hands on with Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> at Gamescom this year, saying, “Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>
<h2>22 – Elden Ring Nightreign</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 2025</p>
<p>FromSoftware aren’t making an Elden Ring 2, but they are working on a spin-off from their smash hit. Elden Ring Nightreign is a more specifically co-op game than before, mixing up the visual style, combat and general setting of Elden Ring with a new format.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While you can play Nightreign solo, it’s intended to be played with a group of three, working together across multiple in-game days to prepare for a final boss. There’s a little dash of battle royale thrown into this as well, with the playable area shrinking after players defeat a minor boss at the end of each day, limiting the second and third day as you get closer to that final encounter. An interesting twist on proceedings.</p>
<h2>21 – Dune: Awakening</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Early 2025 (PC)</em></p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games are popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening – Survive Arrakis Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S-l7NySFsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>
<p>There’s no defined release date yet, but Dune: Awakening will have betas before launch. That launch will also be split, first coming to PC before consoles arrive at a later date.</p>
<p><em>That’s this set of five, and we’re getting towards the pointy end of our list. What here takes your fancy, though?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During Sony’s CES 2025 conference, the company announced some new film and show projects it has begun working on. The key announcements were projects based on Helldivers, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p><iframe title="CES® 2025 Press Conference｜Sony Official" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV95SMpTW-M?start=2327&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima Legends is an anime that is being produced at Crunchyroll, with the basis of the series being the Legends mode of the game. The Legends mode was added in 2020, bringing a co-op multiplayer experience to the samurai game, with four new warriors being made playable and each representing different classes. These were the Samurai, Hunter, Ronin, and Assassin characters who were tasked with working together to deal with supernatural situations. These stories are likely what the anime will be using as inspiration.</p>
<p>When it comes to the big screen, Sony had two major reveals. Both Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting movies. Sony has partnered with Columbia Pictures to make the Horizon Zero Dawn movie, though it is yet too early to know who will be playing Aloy and when it will be release. This follows on from the news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/">Netflix’s Horizon Zero Dawn show</a> had been scrapped in July. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, though again there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>
<p>The next<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/16/until-dawn-movie-has-a-release-date-for-april-2025/"> big game based movie coming out is Until Dawn</a>, which is set to be released in cinemas this April. Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said,&nbsp;<em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-concept-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rgg-and-sega-share-new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-concept-video.1075740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-concept-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and Sega have released a “pre-development concept video” for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">new Virtua Fighter project</a> that was announced during The Game Awards last month. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Looks good, right? Well, it’s all just proof of concept right now, labelled as “Pre-development in-engine footage” and “not actual gameplay”, and so there’s absolutely nothing about the game name, platforms or release windows a moment, but it is showing some of the intent behind RGG’s fighting series revival.</p>
<p>There’s various things to note here, from the density of detail through the backdrops to the light 3D shifting through the stage, and an element of destruction as one Akira throws the other Akira around. There’s also some more of that fighting game visual flair with motion trails and other effects as hits land, where Virtua Fighter has generally been more constrained than others in the genre.</p>
<p>All of this is subject to change, of course, but it’s an initial direction that RGG are taking.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with this pre-production video, it’s a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Fans of the series have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/18/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-review/">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now. Sega is looking to give that game a shot in the arm, both with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9qqpSc0cs&amp;pp=ygUQdmlydHVhIGZpZ2h0ZXIgNQ%3D%3D">a recent 2.0 update to Ultimate Showdown</a> with a new PC port, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaR2wHDKlU">Virtua Fighter 5 REVO coming later this month</a>.</p>

		<p>HBO has released a new teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2, confirming that the show will return in April. Where season one of The Last of Us covered the events of the first game, season two will be delving into the story of the second game, introducing characters like Abby who will have a big part alongside Joel and Ellie.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Of Us Season 2 | April 2025 | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylovT43x3yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Last of Us Season 2’s trailer gives us a lot of brief shots, showing scenes from The Last of Us Part II captured by the show, with a mix of action and terror as the danger increases for everyone. Neil Druckmann has stated that Season 2 will not cover all of The Last of Us Part II. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a>. When asked if The Last of Us season 2 would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-teaser-trailer-reveals-some-new-story-beats/">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser trailer</a> there was more focus on the story, with one major change being Joel talking to what appears to be a therapist about his experiences. This may help people remember some story beats from the previous season, along with providing additional background to the events that occur in Season 2 without having to dive deeply into all of them.</p>
