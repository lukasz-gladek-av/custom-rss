		<p>Sony has formed a brand new first party studio to develop new PlayStation games, with this new studio called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being headed by Jason Blundell, who spent much of his career at Activision working on Call of Duty games from Call of Duty 3 to Black Ops 4 moving up to game director in the process. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020, formed Deviation Games in 2021, left Deviation Games in 2022, with the studio shuttering in 2024.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jeff Gertsmann, Jason said,<em> “It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling, it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</em></p>


<p>Dark Outlaw Games has been working on a new project, but no details have been released about what that game is going to be. With Jason Blundell’s vast experience with Call of Duty, it would not be surprising if this would be a first person shooter or some kind of action game. We will have to see what the game is when Sony and Dark Outlaw Games are ready to reveal details. There is no release window that we can even begin to guess for when this game will be coming out.</p>

		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is sticking with the action RPG gameplay where gear and loot are a key part of your progression through the game. Weapons and gear come in various types and apply to different gameplay styles, but a basic tanto isn’t going to be anywhere near as good as a legendary tanto, and comes without perks.</p>
<p>Alongside levelling up and gaining Mastery points, you’ll need to look out for legendary chests and more. Here’s what to look for to get the best gear and loot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">How to find legendary gear and legendary chests in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</h2>
<p>Shadows has a loot system that uses the familiar common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary item tiers. The higher the tier, the more powerful the piece of equipment, generally speaking, though if you’re particularly lucky and get a good drop, an epic item could be more powerful than a legendary one.</p>


<p>Uncommon items and up come with a perk that can make a big difference, like increaseing armour when health is full, or boosting your damage per adrenaline chunk filled, whilst rare items and better can also be inscribed with another perk of your choice at the forge in your hideout.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the most consistently powerful gear you can count on finding is legendary gear. The stats are betters, the perks are better, and they probably look cooler too. The most consistent way to get it is by opening legendary chests.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to find legendary chests, but most reliably they are found in castles. To open a castle’s legendary chest you first need to defeat all the Samurai Daisho in that castle which can be a little time consuming, but you’ll also find a bunch of resources which you can later use to upgrade your equipment and earn Mastery points, so it’s time well spent!</p>
<p>You can also find legendary chests out in the world, and there are a few things to look out for. First, if you see some soldiers threatening a civilian and kill said soldiers, the civilian will reward you with your choice of either a scout support or some world information. The world information can sometimes give you information about a legendary chest nearby, or a kofun, which is a cave to explore with a legendary chest at the end.</p>
<p>You can also get locations for these chests in kakuregas, which are like outposts where you can fast travel to and restock your equipment. You can get radiant missions from here as well as areas to search for nearby content, such as legendary chests and castles.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p>Remember to pick up as many resources as possible as you play, as on top of the loot’s tier system, they also have levels. Once you’ve built a forge at your hideout you’ll be able to upgrade your gear’s level to ensure it’s still useful after you’ve levelled up a bit. When you upgrade the forge you’ll also be able to inscribe another perk onto rare or better equipment, giving you another modifier of your choice. These perks can be very useful and can be unlocked by completing certain challenges in-game, such as a certain amount of assassinations, as well as be rewards for completing certain quests.</p>
<p>One of the earlier legendary items I found was a tanto for Naoe that, after using a weak point attack (by holding R1 until charged) against a vulnerable enemy, would trigger another vulnerable state afterwards, allowing me to use another weakpoint attack and deal even more damage. As she’s a character that’s much more focused on speed, a skill like this was very useful, so I’ve focused on upgrading it ever since. Once you find an item with a trait that works well for your playstyle, you can keep upgrading it like this until you find a replacement that works even better, or that is so good that it changes how you play.</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it. Looting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes with the standard item tiers, but you need to keep a look our for Legendary chests to find the best gear, and then keep on top of upgrades to all your weapons and items.</p>

		<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get to play as not one, but two characters whilst assassin-ing your way around feudal Japan. Joining forces to thwart another evil plot, Naoe and Yasuke are both very different in just about every way, from their backgrounds and motivations to combat style, tools, and weaponry. As you switch between the two of them at will, you’ll need to adjust your playstyle to account for their strengths and weaknesses, and depending on your preferred playstyle you might wonder, can you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows only as Naoe or Yasuke?</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Who are Naoe and Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Naoe – the sneaky Ninja Assassin</h3>
<p>Naoe is a trained shinobi who is out for revenge in typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, which means she’s both stealthy and sneaky, and your go-to for anything involving either of those two things. In addition to being small, quick, and not wearing clunky, loud armour, she also has a grappling hook to help reach rooftops and vantage points, and a set of tools – kunai, shurikens, bells, and smoke bombs. Naturally this combination of things makes her ideal for sneaking into a castle and methodically assassinating every poor guard who happens to be on duty.</p>
<p>She’s not useless in combat either. She doesn’t deal huge amounts of damage and might have a bit of a tough time taking out the implausibly giant guards, but she is capable provided you make full use of parrying and posture attacks on vulnerable enemies. She can equip two of a katana, a kusarigama, and a tanto/hidden blade combo to fight with and will need to be light on her feet to ensure she doesn’t get boxed in by enemies. The kusarigama will help with that, as its upgrades give improved crowd control.</p>



<h3>Yasuke – The towering Samurai</h3>
<p>Yasuke, meanwhile, is an actual samurai. And by actual, I mean he is based on a historical figure. The slave of a Portuguese Jesuit before Lord Oda Nobunaga took an interest in him, he became the first black samurai in history.</p>

<p>Yasuke is built for combat. In addition to being head and shoulders above most other people in the game, he can absorb much more damage than Naoe can, thanks to his full suit of samurai armour, and carries more rations to quickly restore health. He can choose between a long katana, a naginata, a kanabo, a yumi bow, and a teppo, which is a shotgun-like rifle.</p>
<p>Yasuke doesn’t have any tools, not even a grappling hook, and if you want a ranged weapon you’ll have to use one of your two weapon slots for a bow or teppo. The bow itself can be silent, but guards tend to find it a bit suspicious to see a giant pointing a bow at them. Yasuke’s biggest weakness is how profoundly un-sneaky he is – when he moves he makes more noise than Naoe, as he’s wearing a lot of armour, he climbs much more slowly, and when attempting a leap of faith he bounces right out of the haystack, though still without taking damage thankfully. However, Yasuke doesn’t need any of this. Stealth? He just wades into a camp and fights everyone at once. Climbing? Please, Yasuke can literally sprint through closed gates, breaking them into pieces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</h2>
<p>As fun as Yasuke is to play as, rushing right into the thick of the action and battering enemies, his impressive lack of stealth does make Naoe the better fit for the stealthy assassin fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series. Naoe is the better all-rounder.&nbsp;She can climb quickly, do the leap of faith, attack from range with her tools, and she has a wrist blade so she can assassinate properly as well, whereas Yasuke can only do “his own type of assassination” which usually involves a beheading and lots of noise. More importantly, Naoe can handle herself in a fight far better than Yasuke can handle stealth. It still won’t be easy when you’re fighting off half a castle as her, but at least she can drop a smoke bomb and run away to hide again.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</h2>
<p>The game is clearly designed to necessitate the use of both characters, as Naoe and Yasuke both have important roles through the game’s story, but if you have a favourite, then you can largely stick to playing as just one or the other.</p>
<p>You can switch at any time when in the open world, and major story missions are broken up with decision points to let you choose which character to play as for the next section, so you can simply pick to play as your favourite of the two at those points. The one sticking point is when you need to talk to specific NPCs as a particular character, forcing you to switch for at least a short time.</p>
