			<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy has quite the history, this remake bringing back Benoit Sokal’s Amerzone from 1998, which itself was based on a comic strip from 1986. Amerzone was the first major adventure game Sokal was behind, setting the foundations for its better known cousin, Syberia. Microids’ remake has a lot to live up to from a reputational perspective, and it generally does.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy puts players in the shoes of a nameless journalist, who has their first big break with the opportunity to interview the explorer Alexandre Valembois. Valembois has agreed to speak about his trip to the mysterious South American country of Amerzone, which took place approximately 50 years prior to the events of the game. However, the invite for an interview takes a turn and it leads to the journalist embarking on a trip to Amerzone to return an egg.</p>



<p>This isn’t any old egg that you buy by the half-dozen, but one that ties into the mythology of the indigenous people of Amerzone, holding within it a unique species of bird that is believed to bring good luck to Amerzone. It may seem like a superstition, but since the egg left the country, Amerzone has fallen into a military dictatorship and the indigenous groups have been all but wiped out. Getting to Amerzone is no easy feat since the country’s borders are closed with any interlopers shot on sight. Luckily for the journalist, Valembois has built a vehicle called a Hydrofloat that has all sorts of modes that allows someone to travel from the Brittany coast of France to the secretive South American nation and within it too.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is the very definition of a point and click adventure game. There is no free movement for players. Instead you look in a direction where an arrow appears, press a button, and the character will move along a predetermined path on their own. You can watch the walking animation or choose to skip and be instantly be transported to the next location. In most areas, you will find items to interact with that will either be useful items that you put in your inventory or provide you with information.</p>

<p>You see, aside from attempting to return the egg to its rightful place the journalist is documenting their journey too. Along the way, different investigations will pop up and you can decide to dig further into these by exploring each location thoroughly or moving on and focusing on the main path. Naturally, you will come across items related to these side investigations, and most will draw you in. Amerzone’s environmental story telling is excellent providing a lot of contextual information so you can piece together what has happened in the past, whether it is to do with Valembois’ own story or something completely different.</p>
<p>Amerzone’s main story is fine and does move along at a decent pace. It has some good writing but there are moments which could have benefited from having a bit more of a build-up or not being quite so predictable. You can guess what will happen with the main story beats pretty early on, but with a game like this the journey is more important. The Traveler mode will have more documents and clues to find in the environment to help with puzzles, along with a hint system that will eventually give you the answer if you get stuck. The Adventurer mode, meanwhile, provides fewer clues meaning you will get stuck more often and have to connect the clues yourself to find solutions.</p>

<p>Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy does look very good with environments that have lots of detail to them, from thick foliage in the jungles to some nicely designed beaches on Shipwreck Island. There are some minor performance issues here and there with a bit of stuttering, but on the whole the game performs fine too, and it’s hardly an issue for this style of game. Amerzone’s music is well done too with tunes that fit the atmosphere, though there are moments of silence that could have been filled with song.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy is a very good remake of an already well regarded puzzle game. While the story is a little predictable, it looks very good, the puzzles are well designed, and the environmental story telling is well constructed.	</p></div>

		<p>On the horizon, the number 34 glows on a black monolith. Beside it is the Paintress, an immense humanoid creature with long white hair that covers her face. She waves her hand at the number and it fades away, only for her to replace it with ’33’. Just as she does so, everyone in the world who is of that age turns into smoke and dies, blowing away in the wind. Gustave, is preparing for Expedition 33, the 77th expedition to venture into the fractured world and attempt to defeat the Paintress.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmJ9mE8LMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s the delightfully weird setup for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a theme that runs throughout the game. It’s not just felt through the story or the world either, this is a turn based RPG with real time parrying and dodging elements. It’s got tiny creatures made of wood and giant mythical creatures that are somehow all equally eccentric. And it’s got a protagonist that looks a bit like Robert Pattinson, who played Batman, yet he is voiced by Charlie Cox, who played Daredevil. Like I said, it’s weird from top to bottom.</p>


<p>Gustave is from Paris, or at least from a fragment of Paris that found itself torn from its usual place and left as an island in an ocean after the apocalypse. It’s from here that you set out to reach and defeat the Paintress, after the above setup of course. Then, after everything immediately goes wrong as expected, you find yourself exploring a world made up of the remaining fragments of the old world as you find the survivors of your expedition and make your way towards your goal.</p>


<p>Of course it’s not just a pleasant hike, there’s a variety of strange creatures in your way, so it’s pretty handy that you’ve got magic powers. The turn-based battling here is distinctive and very satisfying. In a manner not too dissimilar from Mario’s RPGs, quicktime events are sprinkled throughout each encounter, boosting your attacks to deal more damage if you time button presses just right, increasing healing, or causing additional status effects, like burn. When on the defensive, timing your dodge will let you avoid damage entirely, while parrying all the hits in an attack let you launch a counter to deal quite a bit of damage in return.&nbsp;Dodging and parrying don’t have onscreen prompts, so you’re left to work out the timing based on the attack animations, some of which can be fiendishly deceptive, and if you miss the mark you’re going to soak up the damage instead.</p>
<p>Each member of your party is radically different, yet exceptionally powerful in their own way. Gustave, for example, builds up charges that can be used to deal very large amounts of lightning damage to enemies, whilst Maelle has skills that switch her between stances that have different effects, such as an aggressive stance that increases damage or a defensive one that increases defence and action point accumulation.</p>

<p>As they level up you’ll naturally be able to unlock more attribute points and new skills to tailor them to your preferred playstyle, but then there’s also the Picto system. Each Picto provides your character a bonus, such as a perfect dodge granting an additional action point, or a basic attack having a chance to apply marked to an enemy, increasing the next damage it takes. Once you’ve had a Picto equipped on any character for four battles, anyone in the party can equip this effect by spending Lumia points, which are only limited by how many of a certain resource you can find.</p>
<p>Basically, you can add a suite of additional effects to each character to further customise them to your playstyle. The combat system is intricate and full of depth, enough that finding another character can sometimes feel a little overwhelming with all the new information you suddenly need to learn. Thankfully they’re carefully explained in a tutorial for each, so it doesn’t take long to get used to things again.</p>
<p>The enemies you’re fighting are a varied bunch, too. From little wooden creatures to gigantic creatures made of stone and glowing runes. They’re admittedly not the most unique designs and could slot quite easily into a few other games, but most importantly there’s a lot of variety in how they fight. Sure, one area tends to have a lot of the same enemies wandering through it, just waiting for you to run up to them and hit them so you get the first hit once it transitions to combat, but the regularity with which the game introduces unique and novel mechanics, sometimes even just for a single fight, keeps things fresh. A couple of highlights include fighting off the Gestrals, the aforementioned wooden creatures that fight inside huge suits made of cloth, hay, and cannons, and a battle with a turtle who couldn’t move.</p>

<p>Probably my favourite aspect of the game, however, has come to be its sense of humour. The Gestrals, which caused immediate dread in me when I first encountered them after the many adorable and annoying creatures I’ve seen through my gaming life, turned out to be quite funny in a chaotic way and managed to not outstay their welcome. Then there’s Esquie, a giant flying mythical being who is equal parts powerful, eccentric, and disinterested, another irreverent bit of comic relief. More than that, the conversations between the main characters are well written and really helped along by excellent performances from the voice cast and very expressive character models as well. The lighter moments really help you warm up to the characters and make them feel far more convincing, so when the darker, more serious moments hit they stand out better and hit harder.</p>
<p>Where it all leads, though, I’m not yet sure, as I’ve yet to finish the main story. This is a relatively long game with plenty of side stuff to get distracted by and, well, I’m not a machine! But so far, I’m really enjoying Expedition 33. The combat is a lot of fun provided you love some well timed parrying and there’s a lot of depth to tailoring your characters. You can even find clothes to dress them up in, which is especially entertaining in the cutscenes – one of my characters currently has red sunglasses, a black and white striped shirt, and a baguette strapped to her back like a sword. So it’s great, but I’ll let you know just how great once I’ve finished it.</p>
