		<p>Four thousand, eight hundred and eleven days. One hundred and fifty-eight months and two days. Thirteen years, two months and two days. Whatever way you want to frame it, it’s going to have been a heck of a long time between the launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, should the latter manage to hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">its latest release date on 19th November 2026</a>.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime opera, and from what little we’ve seen of the game so far, it looks like they’re fully embracing all the wild excess and craziness that you’d expect from a fictionalised rendition of Miami and the Florida Keys.</p>



<p>It looks like this will be a bit of a modern-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde style story with its two protagonists. Lucia Caminos is the series’ first female lead, who’s coming fresh out of a stint in prison, while Jason Duval is working for the local drug gangs. The pair are thrust together after a failed bank robbery, and are then swept up in a grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>As good as it will be to have a new GTA single player story, Rockstar and Take Two are really banking on the next rendition of GTA Online picking up where GTA V’s has left off. It’s this mode that has ballooned Take Two’s coffers over the past decade, and the online platform has grown and evolved massively to give players more things to do, more missions, more career paths to follow, and to front for user-generated content. A new GTA Online will necessarily get back to basics without feeling too hollow. A slow rollout of content was a big part of Red Dead Online’s rapid decline, though Rockstar will have a pretty singular focus for GTA.</p>

<p>But will it actually arrive in November? Rockstar games are prone to at least a couple delays, and GTA 6 has already had two. With its official announcement and reveal in December 2023, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">the tail was pinned on a 2025 release date</a>, but as the higher ups lifted the blindfold to see if they’d hit the target, they realised they’d need to have another go. So it was that by the middle of last year, they decided to get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">a bit more specific and target May 2026</a> instead. Any closer? Not quite. Let’s try November 2026 now.</p>
<p>The problem is that, while there’s still an awful lot of people excited for the next GTA, each delay and announcement has kept the game release at least a year into the future. That’s far away enough that you can absolutely imagine the team getting to that latest six month deadline and realising they, once again, need a bit more time.&nbsp;In the here and now, that means we still have GTA 6 right up there within our top 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, but we’re a touch more excited for a couple of other titles…</p>

		<p>Mutliverse has announced that it is delaying the launch of its colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid PAX Autocratica by a month to address performance, stability, and balancing issues that have been raised. Initially, PAX Autocratica was going to launch on February 2nd into early access, but now it will launch on March 4th instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9bREKlyMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the dev team at Multiverse said, <em>“After review by the Supreme Council, a directive has been issued regarding the deployment of Pax Autocratica. <wbr>The Early Access launch has been rescheduled to March 4, 2026. This decision was not made lightly. Recent internal evaluations and field reports have identified several areas that require further refinement before the State is ready to open Early Access operations. <wbr>These include:<wbr><wbr><wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Core balancing adjustments<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Stability and performance improvements<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Initial onboarding and tutorial refinement</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, we have received a significant number of Quality of Life requests that we intend to address Our objective remains unchanged: <wbr>to launch Early Access with a build that is stable and fully enjoyable.”</em></p>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also previously confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse has previously made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em>&nbsp;“1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>
