		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new fighter for Tekken 8 Season 2, and that is Madagascan Miary Zo who will be coming to the roster this December. To be more precise, December 2nd for those with early access and available for everyone else on December 5th. Miary Zo has a bit of an advantage, as she has the powers of the fighting god, Ogre, who was killed by Jin. You can check out a five minute gameplay reveal of Miary Zo reveal.</p>

<p>In the gameplay trailer, you can see Miary Zo uses martial arts like capoeira and involves parkour too. In addition, Miary Zo has the ability to summon a staff to help pull off additional moves as well as use that power to use moves based upon the animals she has studied through her life to learn moves from.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick said, <em>“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</em></p>

		<p>Pangea Game Studios has set sail upon the good ship Forgotten Seas, which has launched into version 1.0 today. Forgotten Seas is a survival game where you sail in the Bermuda Void where the sea is endless and land can be scarce. The game has been in early access since June 2024, and throughout the development team has been regularly updating it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forgotten Seas | 1.0 Launch Trailer | indie.io" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nju463ZFImA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>During Forgotten Seas early access some of the main additions that were introduced included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crew recruitment, township building, and management systems<wbr></li>
<li>Expanded base-building to create safe havens<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fully developed map system<wbr></li>
<li>Treasure hunting, collection, and display mechanics<wbr></li>
<li>New adventures across the high seas<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sailing skill progression system<wbr></li>
<li>More naval combat encounters and on-foot battles<wbr></li>
<li>Additional ships to master and command<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Commodity trading and delivery missions<wbr></li>
<li>More layered gameplay loops to discover</li>
</ul>
<p>Forgotten Seas has a bit of a unique angle to it in that you craft ships in a bottle and then throw them out to sea. This ship in a bottle then spawns into a full size ship that can be sailed upon the seas. And when you are on land, you can store the ship back in the bottle so you don’t lose it. You can create a fleet of ships too, so there is a choice of what one to take out to sea. That choice has expanded with the launch of version 1.0, with Pangea Game Studios adding the 200-foot dreadnaught The Justicar, though you have to prove yourself to earn it since this ship is resistant to all damage types. There is a new encounter with the enemy Gravy Bones while searching for the Temporal Hourglass. If you do not fancy sailing you can set up multiple businesses on land and manage those instead, including bars and farms.</p>
