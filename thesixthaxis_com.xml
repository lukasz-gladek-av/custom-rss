		<p>A demo for the blacksmithing action RPG Blades of Fire is coming out tomorrow, 15th May, ahead of the game’s full release on 22nd May for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Epic.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/Blades_of_Fire/status/1922016237875294228">Announcing that a demo was coming earlier this week</a>, developer MercurySteam said, “Thank you SO much for the love in response to this! We weren’t planning to release a demo, but we know many of you wanted one, so we had to make it happen.”</p>


<p>A day later, they confirmed that the demo will arrive on 15th May. The demo will allow players to experience the first few hours of the game, with save data and progress able to carry over to the main game at launch.</p>
<p>A new world trailer previews some of the locales that will feature in the full game:</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - World Trailer [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5fHtXRfz28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the developer behind Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and more recently Metroid Dread, Blades of Fire is a Souls-like action RPG, though one that looks to put its own stamp on the genre with a new blacksmithing component for creating the weapons that you use.</p>

<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/07/blades-of-fire-is-the-blacksmithing-action-adventure-you-didnt-know-you-needed/">Playing the game earlier this year, I said</a>, “I really enjoyed my few hours with Blades of Fire. The original fantasy setting, the characters, and their voice acting and script all work for me – Aran’s voice acting reminds me of a cross between Matt Berry and Henry Cavill – but it’s really the unique touches for the combat and the puzzle-like forging that stand out. This is definitely one to keep an eye on when it launches in May.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/1047-debuts-impressive-splitgate-2-map-creator-the-lab-ahead-of-open-beta/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/1047-debuts-impressive-splitgate-2-map-creator-the-lab-ahead-of-open-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> open beta right around the corner on 22nd May, 1047 Games has revealed another key component of the portal-based arena shooter. The Lab is a fully-fledged map creator that will allow for some impressive community-created maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing The Lab - Map Creator | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBiSnzHaoxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking a leaf out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/26/halo-infinite-is-getting-a-the-pit-remake-via-forge/">Halo franchise’s Forge map creator</a>, The Lab aims to be both accessible for more casual map creation, and incredibly deep in terms of the terrains and map layouts it can create in the hands of an expert.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to collaborate in real time with up to 16 people modifying maps at once, and these creations can then be quickly shared. 1047 will provide a range of blank templates to start with, scalable geometric shapes and pre-created map items, environmental props and other gameplay objects.</p>
<p>This isn’t the endgame for the tool with 1047 stating that more map creator content is planned for after launch.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Splitgate 2 will be available from the following store pages to dive into the open beta on 22nd May.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/">Splitgate 2 for PC via Steam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/splitgate-2/9PF5Q1B0FHSL/0010">Splitgate 2 on the Xbox Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010012">Splitgate 2 on the PlayStation Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This full sequel is a complete overhaul with a new progression system and faction skills that start to push the game toward hero and class-based shooters. This could take it past that happy Halo-with-Portals vibe that the original game had, more towards ultra competitive esports, but will allow for more iterative and expanding gameplay over time.</p>
<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. With the open beta coming on 22nd May, it seems that they’re getting pretty close to an eventual release, though details of the full launch have not yet been confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/persona5-the-phantom-x-announcement-set-for-may-15th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>ATLUS has announced a stream for tomorrow, May 15th, at 3pm BST to reveal Persona5: The Phantom X. What we already know about the game is that it is a free to play mobile title that has been in open beta in China since April 2014, and also launched in Taiwan, and South Korea. Just like Persona 5, Persona5: The Phantom X is set in Tokyo, but introduces a new main character for players to name and customise.</p>
<p><iframe title="P5X News -First announcement! We’re the Phantom Thieves, and we’re here to steal your heart!-" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQsdIWTGn_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The stream for tomorrow will delve into details including release dates, at least for a Japan version, along with the newly announced English version of the game. Details of a release date are also expected for that. Much like the mainline Persona 5 game, players will be able to take part in various activities around Tokyo that can help boost stats, gain experience points, or earn some money. Confidants are also dotted around and are people you can speak to you. To unlock unique dialogue options with them, you will need to rank up your relationships. It’ll take longer to do in Persona5: The Phantom X compared to the main game as there are more ranks to work through. There are turn based battles too that will take place in Mementos, where you will grind out daily challenges, along with battles in the story specific Palaces.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Persona 5 game we reviewed was Persona 5 Tactica, and in that review Nic said, “Persona 5 Tactica is a good game, but it is a game that’s standing on the shoulders of giants – when the giant is the size of Satanael, you have a lot to live up to. Indeed, it’s very difficult to score this and not compare it to the other games in the series as a result. Tactica is good, but it’s not great, and while it is always nice to sink into that warm-bath feeling of hanging out with your fictional friends, it won’t be remembered as either a series high or the best spin-off the franchise has to offer.”</p>

		<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> is reporting that Ubisoft’s extreme sports game Riders Republic is going to be getting a movie adaptation, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set to jointly direct. Writer Noé Debré is also attached to the project, and he has writer on films including Dheepan, Stillwater, and Parlement. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are best known for Bad Boys For Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riders Republic: Season 14 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZB-d5e_Z7wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Riders Republic launched in October 2021, bringing a wacky approach to extreme sports with snowboards, skis, and wingsuits, bikes, and jetpacks all being added. It is essentially a sequel to Ubisoft’s 2016 winter extreme sports game Steep. Riders Republic has been getting regular content updates since its release, which points to an active player base, with Season 14 coming last month. That added the Pockett Car and the Park Creator to the game.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/02/riders-republic-review/">Riders Republic Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Riders Republic review, Jim said, “Riders Republic is a game players can effortlessly lose themselves in, even if the gameplay itself is pretty shallow. The endless barrage of events populating the world map become less exciting over time, resembling a shopping list rather than milestones in your ascension to extreme sports godhood. If you’re still keen to take the plunge, make sure you have a posse ready to party up with.”</p>
