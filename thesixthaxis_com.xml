		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

		<p>Football Manager 26 gives the impression of a youngster being given their first senior debut for a big club, stepping into the public eye looking to take the reins from the old guard. It is a new chapter for Sports Interactive’s long running series with a leap to a new game engine and a shift in how it is presented to players. After quite a few hours playing through Football Manager 26, it is a game that shows some promise, but needs a lot of long term updates and changes before it is ready to be considered a successful switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The caveat is that currently Football Manager 26 is considered to be in beta ahead of its official 4th November release, with Sports Interactive releasing regular fixes and updates through this window. That said, Football Manager 26 is clearly a very different experience to the Football Manager games that came before.</p>


<p>A new user interface comes with different tiles and cards you can click on to get more information, there’s a change in the matchday presentation, removal of touchline shouts, removal of gestures for team talks and press conferences, and a delayed release for international management to line up with next year’s World Cup. A positive addition is the long-awaited introduction of women’s leagues as well as new nation leagues that expand the database.</p>


<p>The user interface takes getting used to with a change to menus and the amount of data that is presented to you, split across tabs like the top level Portal, Recruitment, Matchday, Squad, and Club. Within each tab various tiles present information like league position, performance, finances or whatever else you want to look up. While it does look modern, it will take a while to get used to and retrain the muscle memory after so many years of the Football Manager UI being relatively stable. While there is a lot of information, it can be quite overwhelming to find what you need quickly and needing to keep clicking to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Information could be much clearly presented too. News stories are not shown in detail when you open a message in the portal, instead needing to click on it to see the full details. It was much clearer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">Football Manager 24</a>. When it comes to the matchday experience player fitness levels are much harder to read. Where FM24 had big and bold player tiles easily showing the information, the same information is more compact in FM26, and it is not as easy on the eye. This goes for spotting injuries during matches and player skill levels as well. At one point a player was injured who needed subbing off, but it was not clear looking at the tactics screen who I was needing to hook off the pitch.</p>

<p>The change extends to the general tactics screen. Sports Interactive wants players to get a lot more detail when it comes to sorting tactics and there is a depth of information. With tactics you now don’t just select a playstyle, a couple of formations to train, set instructions, and slot your players in. Now, formations are split into in possession and out of possession, so you can set two different tactical approaches to deal with different opponents. It is a good idea to really develop your team and reflects more of how modern teams approach different game states, but there are issues in just moving players and positions around. Swapping players either lags or sometimes does not happen as intended, and trying to adjust positions is not as smooth as in previous instalments.</p>

<p>What is clear right now is that Football Manager 26, in this current stage at least, is the first step of a new era. Much like the start of any new era that comes with a challenge of rebuilding and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better, but with what I have played so far I do not think this is going to be the entry that will hit the potential of what the switch to the new engine and implementation of new features can bring. In my view, it may take one or two more years for the rebuild to really meet its potential.</p>
