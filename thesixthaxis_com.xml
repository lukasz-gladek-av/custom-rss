		<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 this summer, another first party Xbox game that is making the jump to the blue team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Comes to PlayStation 5 This Summer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hellblade 2 will be optimised for both PS5 and PS5 Pro, such that Ninja Theory are putting an “Enhanced” label on the announcement artwork. This new release will have some additional features added into the mix, though these will also be made available as a free update for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC via both Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects on a technical level is what the PS5 Pro can offer over the Xbox Series X. The original release targeted 30fps on Series X with no performance modes, so will the PS5 Pro look to push for higher resolution, add a performance mode, or increase fidelity? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Writing in their announcement post, the team writes, “At Ninja Theory we have a rich heritage of releasing games on PlayStation, starting with Heavenly Sword back in 2007. If you’re familiar with our history, you’ll know that Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice was originally released on PlayStation 4 back in 2017. Developed by a small, passionate team, it resonated with so many of you, the players.</p>

<p>“We released the next chapter of Senua’s story a year ago today, and we know there are many of you who haven’t had the opportunity to experience that next chapter for yourselves. Today we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II on PlayStation 5 this summer.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/24/microsoft-explain-why-they-bought-ninja-theory/">Microsoft’s acquisition of Ninja Theory in 2018</a> came off the back of the success of Hellblade. The studio had struggled to find stability for quite some time, despite critically acclaimed games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry. The first Hellblade was an experiment in small budget game development at AAA quality, and it was a major hit for the studio. It was also a PlayStation 4 console exclusive at its original 2017 launch before being ported to Xbox and Switch in subsequent years. That Microsoft’s acquisition meant that the sequel would be Xbox exclusive was unpopular with PlayStation gamers, to say the least. But Microsoft’s current cross-platform strategy is at least breaking down this barrier for one of the most visually stunning games of last year.</p>
<p>Playing the game last year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">we said</a>, “Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.”</p>
