		<p>I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/">Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch</a> – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wardrum | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUDV13huGew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. </p>
<p>Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. </p>


<p>Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out. </p>

		<p>Bungie has released a new ViDoc for their upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, confirming a new release window for the game, changes that have been made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">since the delay</a>, and setting a price.</p>
<p>Marathon will now launch in March 2026 for PS5 and PC, and it comes with a $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99 price tag.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon - Bungie ViDoc: Vision of Marathon | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4J91kh56jiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the game’s delay earlier this year, Bungie has been playtesting in private and gathering more feedback, making the following changes to the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity chat is now featured in the game</li>
<li>Rook is a new solo scavenger character type</li>
<li>Solo Runner queue</li>
<li>Updates to visual fidelity across the board</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really key changes, given the success and popularity of Arc Raiders. Proximity chat that enables collaboration with other players ad hoc has greatly shaped the gaming community within that extraction shooter, and having a solo queue has enabled distinct playstyles.&nbsp;The Rook character shell is specifically designed to enable you to join matches in progress, coming in with less gear but more potential to quickly scavenge and get out.</p>

<p>Also important is the change to the visuals, which will allow for dead runner bodies to remain in the world, adding a darker layer to the sci-fi visuals.</p>
<p>All of this is good (and so too is a price point that matched Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders), but we’ll have to wait and see if this helps the game come out from under the long shadow cast by its aborted announcement earlier this year. The game’s public testing and the reaction to this went so badly that Sony and Bungie had to pull back to avoid another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>-like disaster. Bungie has also been under pressure with Destiny 2, the company enduring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, and some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/15/bungie-finally-admit-they-messed-up-destiny-2-and-are-going-to-make-changes/">underwhelming reactions to the Edge of Fate</a> expansion this year, which they’ve finally admitted was a misstep and will work to rectify.</p>
