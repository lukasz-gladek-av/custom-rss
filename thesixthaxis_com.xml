		<p>Koei Tecmo has released an anniversary trailer for the Dynasty Warriors franchise which is now 25 years old. In the trailer, there is a flythrough of clips from across the games from the very beginning to Origins and it shows the evolutions that the series has gone through while maintaining the core gameplay. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Dynasty Warriors anniversary trailer ends with two bits of big news for the series. The first is Dynasty Warriors Origins will be getting a major DLC, but there are no details on what that will entail. The second piece of news is that a Dynasty Warriors game will be getting remastered, but Koei Tecmo has not confirmed which of the games will get that treatment.</p>

<p>In our Dynasty Warriors: Origins review, Jim said, <em>“As someone who has zealously played every entry in the series since its inception more than two decades ago, I’d say Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the best Musou game ever. After years of unsurprising reiteration and plenty of misfires, Omega Force has delivered a smart and super polished reinvention of the Musou franchise that corrects so many of its past shortcomings.”</em></p>
