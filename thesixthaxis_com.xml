		<p>Fortnite is becoming a bug-riddled mess these days… but not in a bad way. No, Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome has littered the Battle Royale Island with bugs as part of The Hive, and is tasking you with joining the O.X.R. (Onimorph eXtermination Rangers) to blast them all away.</p>
<p>And who better to blow up some bugs than UNSC Spartans from the Halo franchise, and the Power Rangers?</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGqbypEMcVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New for the Battle Royale Island are some locations themed after this battle, with the OXR HQ there to dish out orders and sell you weapons, while the Ranger’s Ruin is a former OXR weapons lab that has now been overrun. You’ll face off against Swarmers, Bombers, and burrowing Queens, grabbing new weapons like the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver and a&nbsp;Bug Cannon, and getting to the Hammerhead Choppa to rain fire down from above.</p>
<p>It’s all tied together by the new Battle Pass. Purchasing the pass auto-unlocks the UNSC Spartain, while progression will get you the Green Ranger and, from 16th September, you’ll be able to complete quests to unlock a&nbsp;Dino Megazord Outfit.</p>

<p>Also in the Battle Pass are <span>Yoo-mi, </span><span>Agent Patch, </span>Battle Gamer Mae, Lt. Ripp Slade, and the totally not just a panda version of Nick Fury, Onyx Winter</p>
<p>The rest of the Power Rangers will be kept for a Mighty Morphin Bundle that will hit the Shop in August and includes Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Blue Ranger Outfits.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has revealed the fifth and final game that will be included with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-party-pack-11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a> later this year, with Cookie Haus a drawing game that will be sure to be a hit with sweet-toothed artists out there.</p>
<p>Cookie Haus is a cozy drawing game where you decorate cookies to match the prompts, adding layers of icing and sprinkles to match prompts like “a cookie who’s <em>seen</em> some things.” Once cookies have been created, you can then name them and the group you’re playing with with then vote on their favourites &nbsp;for each prompt.</p>
<p><iframe title="The final game in Party Pack 11 is..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb0p6mUjApM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The core thing that sets Cookie Haus apart from our other drawing games is that the drawing interface is built from the ground up to feel very physical,” said Director Chase McClure. “There is something about placing icing and sprinkles on a cookie that makes it more familiar to someone who doesn’t consider themselves an ‘artist.’ But, it also gives this whole new challenge to the Drawful veterans of the group.”</p>

<p>Also included in Jackbox Party Pack 11 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspectives</strong> – There’s been a crime, one player secretly did it, and the evidence comes from your own survey answers! Study the clues, defend your innocence (even if you’re lying), and put your friends on trial.</li>
<li><strong>Doominate</strong> – Take all that is perfectly lovely and destroy it in a head-to-head joke game where the funniest answer is exalted.</li>
<li><strong>Legends of Trivia</strong> – Are you looking for a fantasy trivia game with RPG-inspired elements? Oh boy, do I have some good news for you!</li>
<li><strong>Hear Say</strong> – In Hear Say, you’ll be putting your pipes to work to create hilarious soundscapes. Use your phone as a controller, just like all Jackbox party pack games. But in this one, you get to use the microphone on your phone to get real sound effects that work in the game!</li>
</ul>
