		<p>DreadXP and developer Cara Cadaver have announced that VILE: Exhumed is being released as a free shareware title, after the game got caught up in Steam’s mass banning of games due to payment processors refusing to allow people to buy certain games. It was banned for “sexual content with depictions of real people,” even though the game does not contain any of this. Instead, the game is about the developer’s own experience stalking and violence.</p>

<p>In a statement, Cara Cadaver said,<em> “This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. This is our response to being censored, and our rejection of the idea that horror can be defined as acceptable or not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As soon as we realized that the game had been banned, the conversation internally with Cara became about what we collectively could do to do right by her and her work. In the face of widespread attempted censorship, it didn’t feel like a time for half-measures and compromise, so we all decided that releasing the game into the wild where it could never be made unavailable by a single platform felt like the best option, and strongest message.”</em> said DreadXP Director, Hunter Bond.</p>

<p>VILE: Exhumed is available to purchase from the website <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">Vile Is Banned,</a> from where users can download the game for free or choose to donate funds. Cara has said that 50% of all profits will be donated to the charity Red Door Family Shelter, which is based in Toronto and helps families, refugees, and women who are getting out of violent situations.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced an Indie World Nintendo Direct stream will be taking place on Thursday, 7th August.</p>
<p>The stream will kick off at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 9AM EDT / 6AM PDT) and will run for a tight 15 minutes with a blend of announcements and updates on games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTv0HmKoUqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It follows on from the partner showcase last week, which was stuffed with a whole host of announcements like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-with-its-first-action-packed-trailer/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-a-hd-2d-prequel-coming-to-switch-switch-2-this-year/">Octopatch Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot</a>. In hindsight, there were next to no indie games included in that stream, leaving some big open goals for this Indie World stream to shoot for.</p>
<p>There’s a number of key indie titles that are expected for Switch that could make an appearance here, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-2">Hades 2</a> which is set to be a console exclusive, or the very, very highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if everyone’s wishes are fulfilled!</p>
