            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re entering the hallowed ground of the Top 10, the territory of listicles across countless topics, as we search for our very <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">most desired games of 2026</a>.&nbsp;This batch of games has some galactic and not so galactic racing, a bit of revolution in the air, a much wanted sequel, and an experience that might leave you shaken but not stirred.</p>
<h2>10 – Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In a galaxy far, far away an Empire has fallen and a New Republic is forming. However, this is a time of great upheaval and uncertainty, which means there is space for some sci-fi motor racing. A spiritual successor to Star Wars: Episode I: Racer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> introduces us to the undergroung Galactic League, where racers from different backgrounds and disciplines come together to prove who the best pilot is in the galaxy. Podracer Sebulba is just one of those characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Galactic Racer™ - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiavNl4qxWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is also a new character called Shade, and that is who players embody. Shade is a racer starting at the bottom who has two goals; glory and revenge. Glory in becoming the best racer in the league, and revenge against rival Kestar who wants to run the league in his own way. Racing just makes up one part of Star Wars Galactic Racer, as players will have to navigate alliances and rivalries with other racers to come out on top. There will be race tracks across familiar planets as well as new ones being added to the Star Wars universe.</p>

<h2>9 – &nbsp;Clockwork Revolution</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>inXile Entertainment has steadily built itself up as a studio that can deliver fun and interesting RPGs, from The Bard’s Tale series, through Torment: Tides of Numenera and most recently Wasteland 3 each showing depth in ideas and execution. But since their acquisition by Microsoft they’ve been able to push on towards full AAA territory. Clockwork Revolution is the time-bending RPG coming out of this ambition, and it’s high on our list following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gets-a-time-bending-crime-filled-gameplay-reveal/">a great looking gameplay reveal</a> that showcased fun gameplay, comedy, and a world that can be changed by player actions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clockwork Revolution | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clockwork Revolution is set in the year 1895 in the steam powered city of Avalon where humans and clockwork people live and work together side by side. It is also a world filled with criminals and a powerful ruling class that can time travel to craft Avalon in their image. Unfortunately for them, your character has also found a way to time travel and shape the city to their own ends. We know the main character is a scoundrel who appears they will do anything to get ahead. The character creation alone is integrated into the game as someone giving the police a description of you after you have robbed them.</p>
<h2>8 – Forza Horizon 6</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC (and possibly PS5) – 2026</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">announcement for Forza Horizon 6</a> had some of its impact taken away after the Forza Horizon social media accounts posted the teaser ahead of the official reveal at Tokyo Game Show. The teaser pans across items from different parts of the world before settling on a Japanese license plate and a white Neko figure. It then pans up to show Mount Fuji, confirming Forza Horizon 6 will be taking place in Japan.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwlw0ChiSR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not much is known about Forza Horizon 6 right now, beyond the fact that it will carry on in the traditions of the open world series. Seasons will be returning, and the map will have be landmark-filled approximation of Japan, including Mount Fuji, Tokyo, and rural areas. This map is being developed with Japanese consultants so more is shown of the country than just the touristy bits. Expect to see an awful lot more of this game, and likely a release date announcement during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-announced-will-feature-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/">Developer_Direct stream on 22nd January</a>.</p>
<h2>7 – 007: First Light</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 27th May 2026</em></p>
<p>While we still wait on the news on who will be the next James Bond for the films, we don’t have to wait much longer for IO Interactive’s take on the most famous of spies, even if the game has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/007-first-light-delayed-release-date-may-2026/">delayed to May</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive’s most ambitious games, taking on the mantle of crafting a new Bond story while using lessons learned from its highly acclaimed Hitman games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="007 First Light – Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpP_WXrDArQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bond is not yet the globe trotting super spy we all know, but a young agent still earning his reputation and having to work as part of a team. The mission is to take down 009 who has gone rogue, using MI6’s own tactics against them. Bond is a loose cannon who will do things his own way to get the job done, even if it doesn’t please others in the organisation. The game will feature spycraft, shootouts, and driving ( a first for IO Interactive) with each taking inspiration from the 007 books and movies.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">read more about the game in our very own preview</a>.</p>
<h2>6 – Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was heralded as a great return to form for the boomer shooter form, getting critical acclaim and commercial success. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has already got high expectations placed upon its shoulders, and what we know of it so far seems to promise a lot more action without sacrificing much of what made Boltgun great.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Character Reveal Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43jjsBVarPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 gives us two protagonists to play as, Sternguard Veteran Malum Caedo and Sister of Battle, Nyra Veyrath. Each has their own playstyle so you can try new ways of taking on enemies as you travel through a hive city and mangrove swamps. The story will also have a branching narrative with each choice taking you to different levels, meaning you may have to play through a few times to see everything. On top of that there are new enemy units to engage in combat with including Bloodletters ,Juggernauts and other new enemies from different factions. Boltgun 2 is going to be a bigger and louder experience than its predecessor, but we will have to wait and see if it is better.</p>

<p><em>That’s it for today, and we’re going to take a day off tomorrow to catch our breath and then blitz through out top five with daily posts. What’s going to come out on top?</em></p>

		<p>EpicTellers Entertainment has announced that those who have backed Starfinder: Afterlight with the closed beta access option will be able to play some of the early parts of the game in February. If you are interested in getting in on the closed beta, you can still back Starfinder: Afterlight on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight?ref=33q47w&amp;utm_source=steam&amp;utm_campaign=closedbeta&amp;utm_medium=steamnews&amp;utm_content=devpost">Kickstarter</a> which will grant access.
