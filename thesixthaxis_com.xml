		<p>SpaceCraft will not be entering early access this year, Shiro Games has announced, pushing back the release to Q2 2026. However, Shiro Games has announced that there will be a playtest for SpaceCraft taking place and it will be starting at the end of October. However, there are some restrictions such as there only being EU servers, limited space, English translation only, and it will not represent the early access version of the game. However, the playtest will be continuous and new content will be added. The roadmap for SpaceCraft’s playtest can be seen below.</p>



<p>Shiro Games has confirmed it has been able to implement a much requested feature for SpaceCraft, and that feature is cockpit view when piloting ships. The studio did issue an apology for delaying SpaceCraft’s early access saying,<em>“In order to fit the playtest in our development schedule, the Early Access release window has been moved to Q2 2026. We understand this news might be disappointing to some of you, and for that we would like to apologise. The playtest is a crucial part in our process of developing a high quality experience and we could not prepare for a successful Early Access launch without incorporating player feedback beforehand.”</em></p>
<p>In SpaceCraft, players will have the option to forge their own path in the galaxy, but that does not seem to be the way for long term success. Shiro Games has stated that connections between players is the real key, building up organisations and factions called Corpos, to dominate the emerging economy and becoming new military powers too. Players will be able to build orbital and land based bases that will grow as more housing and resource centres are added. Searching and securing resources will be necessary to keep things running and growing.</p>
