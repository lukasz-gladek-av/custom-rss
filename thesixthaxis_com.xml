			<p>Out of all the promising indie horror games both in the works and recently released, Heartworm stands out due to taking influence from Fatal Frame alongside the more usual Silent Hill and Resident Evil inspirations. This stems in part from the use of a camera as your main weapon, but also from the sense of unease and spectral enemies. Having enjoyed the demo last year, the full game is another stellar indie horror to add to the growing pantheon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heartworm | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-ckqEK89Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the usual viral incident or plague of horrors, Heartworm features a far more individual and internalised narrative. Sam, mourning the loss of her grandfather, is thrust into a static-filled TV in a classic ‘isekai’ story and finds herself confronting traumatic memories and environments constructed from her worst fears and insecurities. This all adds up to a horror that is concerned with trauma and grief rather than conspiracies and secretive institutions – another way in which Heartworm is far closer to Silent Hill than Resident Evil.</p>


<p>The aesthetic of Heartworm is clearly inspired by the crunchy polygons of the original PlayStation and that graphical style is absolutely perfectly suited to both the survival horror genre and the nostalgic tone of this game in particular. There is an option to activate a graphical smoother, but this feels like a betrayal of the developer’s visual intention to my eyes. Backgrounds are often atmospherically indistinct, but there is a good variety of locations from abandoned schools and hospitals to a disorientating hedge maze.</p>


<p>Sam is far from the usual survival horror protagonist. Neither a highly trained special forces operative nor a depressed divorced dad, instead she is a smart and witty character who takes incredible events in her stride but is clearly working through some difficult memories. Her hipster appearance makes her ideally suited to a game that is in and of itself a meta study of nostalgia and the toxic way in which unresolved traumas can fester and become dangerously all-consuming.</p>
<p>Your camera is the only weapon at your disposal and is used to fend off enemies, but fighting is mostly a last resort outside of boss encounters and certain foes that trap you in a ring of rocks. Instead you’ll mostly find that running from monsters is the most effective and efficient approach – theres are the traditional limitations on ammo and resources here. There is a burst mod accessory you can attach to your camera, though it feels as if more should have been included to vary your offence. When using your camera, the perspective switches to an over-the-shoulder one which makes aiming more accurate and contrasts nicely with the traditional fixed camera perspective of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The fixed camera perspective works in setting the mood and tone whilst traditional tank controls work perfectly – although modern options are available for those with an aversion to them. My only real complaint with the camera is that the view is a little too zoomed out and it can be difficult to make out what is happening at times. This was exacerbated when playing on Steam Deck; it works fin, but I found navigation easier on the larger screen, especially in some of the darker environments.</p>
<p>Exploring the various areas in the game involves the usual mixture of puzzles, locked doors, and riddles to solve. Whilst many of these are very traditional they are all well judged and offer the right amount of challenge and difficulty. Making sure that you collect all notes is essential as clues are hidden throughout them, from keywords to number combinations and even, in one memorable case, a sequence of keys to play on a piano. Navigating each zone is helped by an easily read map, which also features a welcome visual cue as to whether a room is completed, but I did find the wilderness level with its similar looking routes more difficult to navigate than the more contained urban environments.</p>

<p>The most memorable moments in Heartworm are some thrilling boss battles against horrific foes ranging from giant spiders (thankfully there is an arachnophobia toggle) and mutated deer to a nightmarish being made entirely of unspooled VHS tapes. These battles will test your reactions and movement as well as involving some puzzle elements. As resources are limited you’ll find it useful to hoard some healing items for these encounters in particular. Whilst there is a limited inventory I never found this to be an issue as items are usually picked up and used relatively close together. The exceptions here are some items that I never found a use for, which may well be linked to a secret ending.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Heartworm is another top notch indie horror to add to the collection and one that perhaps feels the closest to the games that clearly influence it. The mixture of Fatal Frame combat and Silent Hill gameplay is perfectly judged and the end result is a game that not only pays homage to the classics but deserves to be considered amongst them.	</p></div>

		<p>A PS5 Closed Beta for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel </a><span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">Tōkon: Fighting Souls has been announced for 5th-7th September.</span></span></p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls PS5 Closed Beta Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpYZUnPFqbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For those who get in on the closed beta, Marvel <span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">Tōkon: Fighting Souls will have six playable characters, online matches with a shared communal space where you can also enter a spectator mode. Of course, you’ll also want to brush up your skills in a training tutorial and there will be a little more to sample beyond that as well.</span></span></p>
<p>The six playable characters include Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Ms Marvel, Storm, Captain America and Star-Lord. There’s a Japanese anime-infused style to their designs here, and we get to see some of the colour variants like a green Captain America, and special attacks that include a big triple-barrel gun for Star-Lord and Iron Man’s Hulkbuster suit unleashing a Super Saiyan-style beam attack.</p>

<p>The closed beta announcement comes a few days after Arc System Works Game Director Kazuto “Pachi” Sekine gave a little beginners guide introduction to the game’s fighting mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls Beginner's Guide" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1c9TcMIWfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel <span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">Tōkon: Fighting Souls</span></span> is a tag fighter but it is pushing the boundary to be a 4v4 system. There are different ways to approach it. You can use one fighter with the other three in the team being assists, or swap through each character to work out the different styles that they have.</p>
<p>The game is a big collaboration between Sony, Marvel and Arc System Works, who have developed some of the most celebrated fighting games of the past decade including Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dragon Ball FighterZ, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote,&nbsp;“By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Titan Quest II starts with a literal Greek tragedy. You arrive with the Spartans, the iconic warrior nation, at the height of their power, but it doesn’t take long before fate and the Gods intervene, striking them down with mystical fire and reducing them to nothing. Their ambition angered the goddess, and they paid the ultimate price. Yet, for all of this death and destruction, Titan Quest II begins with hope.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin your journey on Proti Island, your created character ready to embark on a tale worthy of myth and legend. Here in Early Access, you can choose from a selection of preset character builds and give them a name, but you have to assume that there’ll be a full character creation tool come the final release.</p>


<p>My Greek hero, Domocles, boasting olive skin and a hefty beard, began the game as all newly made characters should: barely clothed, with a puny sword strike and the ability to dodge. Fortunately, as soon as you beat up a few nearby pots, you immediately begin to build up your inventory, helping you protect yourself from the dangers that are coming your way.</p>
<p>This gear isn’t prescribed either, with different runs granting you different loot at different times. And there is so much loot. If there was really this much loot in Ancient Greece, Hercules would never have made it to the Underworld, he’d have been rummaging in his pack every two seconds.</p>

<p>Holding the attack button sees your character continually swing away with their sword, but it’s best to remember to dodge if you want to last more than a few moments here. It’s only a few short moments before you go from being newborn, bashing pots like a well-tanned Link, to going off to hunt a Gryphon, and you’ll have to be ready for an onslaught of crabs, wolves and undead on your way there.</p>

<p>Titan Quest II feels like a classic action RPG. You fight off monsters, collect loot, improve your weaponry and level up as you gain experience. It’s reassuringly familiar, but it’s also presented with such clarity and vision that you can’t help but be swept up within its historic setting and mythological beasts.</p>
<p>I especially love the music. It evokes the ancient setting so well, with its carefully attuned vocals and traditional instrumentation backed by the swells of more conventional Western orchestral strings. It’s packed with drama, nuance, and emotion, and I found myself repeatedly sitting back and listening to it while writing this article.</p>
<p>When you level up, you gain Attribute Points, and Titan Quest’s stats are dealt with in an interesting way, spread across Might, Agility, Vigor, and Knowledge. These go on to &nbsp;affect three further stats, with Fitness, Resolve and Cunning growing depending on where you’ve placed your previous points.</p>

<p>Alongside Attribute Points, you have Masteries, which deal with your skills. Here, you can level up each of your core abilities, but there’s further nuance and depth brought by then applying modifiers to each one, tailoring and specialising your character in a way that will make them truly unique to you.</p>
<p>These might range from upping the damage against wounded enemies, or giving you a chance to inflict Slow on them, and there’s so much to mess around with that you could find yourself falling down a menu-based rabbit hole. Still, we like that, right?</p>
<p>If you want even more specialisation, Titan Quest II will give you more, and once you’ve unlocked them, you have two further sets of abilities to choose from. Once again, this is Mastery, though this time you’re choosing between Earth, Rogue, Storm and Warfare.</p>
<p>Rather than being ancient X-Men, these specialisations funnel you towards spell-casting, fighting from the shadows or becoming a beast on the battlefield, unlocking further abilities within each one. I love the amount of customisation there is, even in Early Access, and I can see players really gelling with the various systems and options.</p>
<p>If you get things wrong, or head down a path towards Rage modifiers that you decide don’t work out for you, you can hit the Respec Mode, and reverse your choices. This isn’t free though, so expect to spend some of your hard-won Gold if you decide to hit reset.</p>

<p>While it clearly shares a great deal with Diablo, Titan Quest 2 has an undeniably different feel, with fewer enemies, at least at the outset, and a more considered approach to combat. It’s more grounded, which is almost amusing when you’re comparing demons and mythical beasts, but I felt that combat, even on the normal difficulty, was tougher here, making everything feel harder won.</p>
<p>If I was being picky, I’d like a little more weight and impact to your strikes, and hopefully that’s something that can be tweaked through Early Access. There’s also a little wonkiness with controller inputs when you’re in the menus that will need sorting out, but as it stands you can remedy everything as long as you’ve got your mouse lying in wait.</p>
<p>Titan Quest II makes a great first impression in Early Access. Its enveloping world, tough but fair combat and deep loot and experience trees, are perfectly weighted to pull you ever deeper into myth and legend.</p>
