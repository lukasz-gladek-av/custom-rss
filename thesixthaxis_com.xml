		<p>Digital Extremes and Team17 have released a big update for Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition, porting a whole host of classic Worms game experiences into the modern remaster and console release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition | Backworms Compatible Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Soa8O7CQokg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s particularly curious about how they’ve done this is that, rather than taking the PC release of each Worms Armageddon predecessor, they’ve instead gone with a bunch of console ports and adaptations, taking them from the 16-bit and 32-bit platforms of yore.</p>
<p>The three retro revamps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worms (Super NES)</li>
<li>Worms (Genesis/Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Worms World Party (Game Boy Advance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again, the game already included a playable version of the Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon, so going down the console and handheld path isn’t that outlandish, and these will make for some fun curios to explore.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is the community requested ‘Boggy B’ cheat code, which allows you to just toggle all unlockable content on via the Options Menu.</p>
<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>Launching last September, Anniversary Edition took the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game still has periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> update 1.5 is out now, the patch, which has been branded as the ‘Guns and Looting Patch’, bringing new weapons, new gameplay features and official mod support.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting a the top, there are two new weapons included in the patch, with a new sniper rifle and a new pistol:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Three-Line Rifle:</strong> A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle with impressive range and precision. Ideal for sharpshooters, this rifle has quickly become a favorite among veterans of the Zone. Encounter it early in your journey and test your aim against distant threats.</li>
<li><strong>Kora Pistol:</strong> A heavy-hitting, clunky pistol that sacrifices speed for raw power. Each shot from its limited magazine packs a punch, making it a must-have for stalkers who value impactful firepower. Seek out the rare Night Stalker variant, a unique Kora coveted by weapon collectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further enhancement for patch 1.5 is Mutant Parts Trading. When you defeat bloodsuckers, fleshes, and other mutants, they now drop various parts like eyes, tusks and tentacles, which are apparently quite valuable and can be traded to NPCs for coupons. First you must visit Malachite to learn how to harvest them in a tradable condition, though.</p>

<p>Beyond that, patch 1.5 has a bunch of quality of life and system improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further A-Life improvements:
<ul>
<li>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player’s view.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.<wbr></li>
<li>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.<wbr></li>
<li>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants’ lair, for example, those mutants won’t simply reappear moments later.<wbr></li>
<li>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone’s population.<wbr></li>
<li>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the “pop-in” effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Electric Water Tornado anomaly.</li>
<li>New vehicle models scattered across the terrain.</li>
<li>Expanded stash window size for better inventory management.</li>
<li>Distinct icons for each ammo type, making identification effortless.</li>
<li>Reload renewal, allowing Skif to seamlessly resume interrupted reloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, full and official mod support has arrived in the form of The Zone Kit. Available on the Epic Games Store, this allows players to reshape the Zone and tweak gameplay to their heart’s content. Mods can then be shared via mod.io and Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>It allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify or create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and anomalies.</li>
<li>Adjust gameplay to suit your preferences, whether you’re seeking more challenge, less difficulty, or something entirely new.</li>
<li>Share creations effortlessly via mod.io or Steam Workshop, depending on the platform.</li>
<li>Future updates will add even more functionality to the Zone Kit, ensuring endless creative possibilities. This marks Phase One of the mod support launch, so stay tuned for future updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very healthy update already, even in short, but the full patch notes high level patch notes for STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 are also available – <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-5">more detailed and granular patch notes are available here</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/turtle-beach-airlite-fit-gaming-headset-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we’re being assaulted by a barrage of new peripherals to go alongside it. Turtle Beach, never one to miss an opportunity to sell the odd headset or two, have seen fit to launch an all-new version of the Airlite Fit, previously a PDP product but now brought under the welcoming branches of the palm tree-toting brand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Airlite Fit" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ucyy5jaW_-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a budget headset. At £27.99 – and available for as low as £19.99 – the Airlite Fit is seriously affordable, and while it’s likely aimed at the younger gamers in your household, with its original Switch blue and red livery, older gamers will find that this is a comfortable and surprisingly great-sounding headset.</p>


<p>I’ve been putting the Airlite Fit through its paces with the Switch 2, and as a 3.5mm wired headset, I’ve been able to pair it with the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. It’s an ideal match, and you’ll find that there’s heaps of volume to drown out any external sounds, despite the Airlite Fit’s relatively weak passive noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Airlite Fit lives up to its name by being exceedingly light. That’s thanks to the plastics used in the build, from the earcups through to the headband. There’s a serious amount of flex to the headset, and I worried about the sturdiness at first without any metal running through the centre. I didn’t need to worry, though, as you can twist it into all sorts of worrying shapes before it returns to its original shape. I don’t think it’s going to last as long as some headsets out there, but it’s solid enough to survive through regular play.</p>


<p>There’s then memory foam padding in the headband, and in the earpads, covered by soft jersey knit fabric, which helps to keep comfort levels good throughout extended play. The Airlite Fit does a decent job at this price point, but if you’re used to the finer things in life, or just a headset that’s a step or two up the price scale, then you’ll likely notice the slightly harsher plastics and fabric more keenly.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about the Airlite Fit is just how good they sound. Outfitted with well-tuned 40mm drivers, there’s a lot of Turtle Beach’s trademark bombast to the audio output, giving every encounter a huge amount of drama thanks to the enhanced bass. It doesn’t come at the cost of the top end though, and they outpace some far more expensive headsets and headphones.</p>
<p>Whether that’s been testing out massive RPG hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma</a> or the new Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, or diving into multiplayer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, gaming sounds great with the Airlite Fit in tow, and there’s a lot to be said for the ease of plugging in a wired headset, and using its single volume wheel control.</p>

<p>That continues into other media, and listening to music, especially rock, metal and rap, really benefit from the tuning of the Airlite Fit. There’s not quite the detail you’ll find in more expensive or specialised headsets, but there’s drama and depth, with tracks like Bad Omen’s The Death of Peace of Mind, or Fort Minor’s Where’d You Go sounding absolutely great.</p>
<p>Thanks to its recent update, I’ve played a heap of Splatoon 3, with the added bonus of Switch 2’s onboard Gamechat functionality finally bringing Nintendo fully into the modern multiplayer age. The noise-cancelling mic is another high point for the Airlite Fit, with a flip-to-mute adjustable mic arm that sits exactly where you put it, with loads of adjustability. If you don’t want to use it, it sits well out of the way, but it’s exactly where you need it when it’s time to shout at your friends.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/project-motor-racing-races-to-a-november-launch-with-an-intriguing-single-player-career/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alongside a single player career mode reveal, Straight4 Studios has confirmed that Project Motor Racing will launch on 24th November across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO (and controversially outspoken figurehead) Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>
<p>The career mode aims to provide a realistic take on motorsports careers, featuring over 70 vehicles from 10 different racing classes, going from 1970s sports cars through to modern GT3s and LMDh hypercars, and it will have 27 scanned real world tracks.</p>
<p>The career mode, as detailed in the trailer, looks fascinating. Instead of something akin to Gran Turismo where you take winnings, earn trophy cars and build a garage, the career gives you a starting point of your choice, and then challenges you to succeed and progress through financial earnings and smart moves. It’s not all about winning, but it is about your winnings.</p>

<p>You’ll have one of three financial backstories, set a location for your team – which affects entry fees and competitions available – and then choose financial backing through sponsors. There’s no car unlocks or levelling up needed for the top tier of racing, outside of simply needing to be able to afford them. Of course, higher and more generous sponsorship models (which could cover travel fees separately from base pay and performance bonuses) will come with higher demands, and if you can’t meet them, you could be out on your ear pretty quickly. Crashes and damage will also have an impact, as that cost comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>It’s another interesting take on the concept, similar to how Project CARS let you start at any racing category, and will be fascinating to see how the financing is tuned and balanced in the game.</p>
<p>Of course PMR will also have a full suite of online multiplayer racing, focusing on more sim-minded gamers with features like full race weekends to test yourself again.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on for sim-racing fans and those looking for a fresh alternative to the more established examples of the genre.</p>
