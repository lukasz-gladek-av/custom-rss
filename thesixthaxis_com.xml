		<p>Skeleton Crew and developer Panic Stations have announced Frog Sqwad, a slapstick physics-based multiplayer game for up to eight players.</p>
<p><iframe title="???? Frog Sqwad ???? Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2BGF12nGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a frog with a sticky tongue, and that’s how you’ll get around and solve puzzles in Frog Sqwad. You’ll swing from pipes, drag giant food through tunnels, catapult friends, grow in size to become a megafrog, and more. Why are you doing this? Why are you and all your buddies in the sewers? That’s because of the Swamp King.</p>
<p>The Swamp King is endlessly hungry, and will demand for more and more food each and every day. You’ll go on runs, trying to earn gold to unlock more physics toys and gadgets, and just try to keep meeting quota.</p>
<p>Frog Sqwad – this is seriously hard to type out and not get letters jumbled up – is the first project from newly founded studio Panic Stations, which has been founded by a clutch of ex-Fall Guys developers who just want to make co-op games.</p>

<p>This game – that’s much easier to type – will be launching in 2026, but wait! You can play it tomorrow! A Steam Playtest will start on 11th December and runs through the weekend.</p>

		<p>CorgiSpace has been revealed by Canabalt creator Adam “Atomic” Saltsman, a collection of original Pico-8 sized games that have “short legs” on purpose. It’s available now from Steam and itch.io.</p>
<p><iframe title="CorgiSpace | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaH_5CDT7Vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been at Finji for a good long while and helped create larger games such as Night in the Woods and Tunic, Adam Atomic felt like getting back to smaller experiences, and started to create little quirky games based off quick and funny ideas.</p>
<p>There’s more than a dozen games in the collection, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat Dreams – a soulslike where you have to dodge roll everywhere</li>
<li>Dust Settlers – a tetris-like where you’re terraforming planets</li>
<li>Skeleton Gelatin – a metroidvania with no upgrades or jumping</li>
<li>Prince of Prussia – a game where you’re stabbing Nazis, but in a fun way</li>
<li>Vampire vs. Pope Army</li>
<li>Dust Bunny – Eat all the dust</li>
<li>Dermis – Shoot asteroid and save the Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more beyond that.</p>

<p>You should be able to explore each game in under an hour, but some of them with –&nbsp;<em>gasp –&nbsp;</em>save your progress!</p>

		<p>Funktronic Labs has revealed Scramble Knights Royale, a game that essentially blends together the Zelda-like adventure genre with the battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scramble Knights Royale - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMWryL7--F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game start you off with a steam boat that chuffs around the battle island, and when you choose to depart, you’ll surf on the back of a turtle to make it to land. From there, you’ll do all the Zelda-like things of grabbing loot, delving into dungeons and fighting bosses. That rewards you with better gear, secondary abilities, blacksmith upgrades and more.</p>
<p>It will eventually come to a head where you face off against the other players that have done the same in other parts of the world. Will you have grabbed enough upgrades and abilities to beat them?</p>
<p>Scramble Knights Royale has a claymation art style to go with the top-down view of the world, which looks delightful. The game is obviously online, but there’s also local split-screen, so you can team up on the same system. That’s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The game is still deep in development, but if this piqued your interest, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379350/Scramble_Knights_Royale/">ask to join the Steam Playtest</a> from its store page.</p>
