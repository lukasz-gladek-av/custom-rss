		<p>Getting a big new trailer and gameplay reveal during the Xbox Developer_Direct was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> – the next game from Compulsion Games, the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/09/we-happy-few-review/">We Happy Few</a>. South of Midnight is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PC and will be day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> when it launches on 8th April 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> looks to be something rather different compared to Compulsion’s previous work, whisking us away to the fantasy world of Prospero and confronting our heroine Hazel with giant sea monsters.</p>
<p>Hazel is a 19-year-old with a remarkable set of abilities that emerge through the game as she discovers and becomes a Weaver. These abilities let her see beyond the surface of the world, viewing the strands that tap into a deeper reality and the Grand Tapestry that binds everything together.</p>
<p>As she repairs the world around her, it can and will reveal that mythical creatures are actually real… such as the narrator and companion that is Catfish.</p>

<p>The game features an almost claymation visual style, blending together action adventure exploration with Bayonetta-style combat, using her spindle, weaving hooks and more alongside her magical abilities to push, pull and weave.</p>
<p>The world also blends together vibes of the deep south of America with giant, island-sized alligators and more. That is just one of the huge creatures that she will seek out as she tries to find out what happened to her mother in the natural disaster that befell the region.</p>
<p>She will also be able to peel back the past by viewing echoes of events that happened, reliving them on her adventure. There’s deep scars through the world, whether it’s seeing buildings that have been reclaimed by nature, or people that have stayed behind.</p>
<p>All of this is being brought to life in an intriguing stop motion style, calling back to Compulsion’s roots as a studio.</p>

		<p>Having a made a name for themselves with the minimalist rally game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/art-of-rally-xbox-series-x-game-pass-summer-2021-kenya-update/">Art of Rally</a>, Funselektor is back with Over&nbsp;the Hill, a cosy looking off-road exploration game to play with your friends. The game is coming to Steam sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="over the hill - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFi39URiesI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sending you off through simultaneously serene and challenging minimalist environments, Over the Hill has you rambling through the world in a 4×4, whether playing solo or going with friends. There’s a day and night cycle and dynamic weather that will help to make the experience all the more immersive, while dealing with less than reliable trails, needing to link together to traverse fast-flowing rivers and more.&nbsp;The goal, in case you really need on, is discover portals that link the various environments together.</p>
<p>It all sounds a bit MudRunner to me, but without the harsh Soviet-era vehicles and perhaps not as treacherous with its terrain.</p>
<p>Funselektor founder Dune Casu said, “<em>After having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace. In a way, this game is similar to the experience I’ve had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There’s something special about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home</em>.”</p>

<p>Over the Hill is a collaboration between Funselektor and Strelka Games, who they partnered with for their racing management sim Golden Lap last year. It will be the fourth Funselektor game, all of which have been motor vehicle-based.</p>
