		<p>The classic dinosaur hunter is back with Turok: Origins announced during The Game Awards. Saber Interactive is taking the classic IP and mixing it up with the three-player co-op, bringing it to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turok Origins - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cs4PW9oOPlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Turok: Origins will be a “fast-paced, third-person, sci-fi shooter, featuring both solo and cooperative action for up to three players,” which sure as heck sounds a lot like Saber’s template that they used for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a> and this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>.</p>
<p>The snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer suggest that they won’t be featuring their massive horde tech on this occasion, instead focussing more on small numbers of dinosaurs, using your weapons and abilities to down them before absorbing their DNA to upgrade your arsenal.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there will be a wide array of weapons, including plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns and more.</p>

<p>“Turok was one of the first console shooters I ever played,” said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. “When we looked at game franchises that we felt deserved to be brought back, Turok was at the top of our list. At Saber, we love taking classic IP and combining it with fresh gameplay. We are excited to finally announce the game, but we’ll be even happier when we deliver this old-school experience with modern-day execution.”</p>
<p>Turok first made his way into video games with the the trilogy of N64 games – Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. There was also the multiplayer focused Turok: Rage Wars. Since then, however, the franchise basically vanished into nothing, failing to land a hit in the early 2000s with a PS2 era Turok: Evolution or PS3 era Turok reboot. It’s really the N64 games that live on in the memory of gamers, thanks in no small part to Nightdive Studios who released that original trio of games in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/06/turok-and-turok-2-remasters-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">2015, 2017</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/24/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remastered-has-been-announced/">2023</a>, respectively.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/farmagia-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/farmagia-review.1060728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/farmagia-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><span data-contrast="none">Have you ever been playing Pikmin and actually wanted to farm the adorable little plants complete with tilling land and ensuring they get enough water? &nbsp;Well, do I have a game for you. Farmagia (pronounced Far-mag-ia instead of Far-mage-ia in the biggest missed opportunity of the year) does exactly this combination of things, allowing you to cultivate your own personal army of part-plant, part-animal creatures to fight for you against other, equally adorable critters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Farmagia – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMlVgNeNp9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Set in the world of Felicidad, Farmagia follows one of the titular mages, Ten, as he and his friends grapple with being part of a rebellion to overthrow Glaza, the Magus. This deeply villainous character leads the Oración Seis, a set of regional lords that govern each continent of the world who you will get to know in your travels whether you want to or not. The story follows a typical structure as you travel the continents in your attempts to aid the rebellion, meeting new friends and foes alike and dispatching the majority of the latter. I kept wanting the story to take a turn, break out of the predictable path it was on, and be a little more exciting, but it never truly got there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">The gameplay is split into two sections, with farming and exploring dungeons being your two main activities. Beginning with the farming mechanics, this is one of the more engaging parts of the game as you plant the different Buddies that can be cultivated. Each one takes a specific amount of in-game time, and you must water them each in-game day as they grow on your farm. You can buy and craft items to help with this, such as increasing the yield from your crop or reducing the amount of time needed for it to grow, then leave the land to do its work as you go off to the dungeons. All activities on the farm cost FP (Farming Points) and you restore all your FP by resting overnight.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Where it gets a little deeper is in the difference between the types of Buddies you can cultivate. Battle Buddies, as the name suggests, will come into battle with you (more on this in a moment), but the Research Buddies are far more interesting. Planting Research Buddies will contribute toward your overall research in not only that creature, but also gain you points to use in the research tree. This then unlocks better farming equipment, larger farming space, new types of craftable items and even more powerful Battle Buddies. The problem being that all of this swiftly descends into busy work. Depending on your tolerance for that, the farming can quickly become monotonous and stale.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">In the dungeons, the combat is initially very enjoyable, giving the player up to four types of Battle Buddies to use in combat, each of which is attributed to a different face button. Pressing their corresponding button sends them out to attack your current target, building up their gauge to perform a powerful attack called a Unite Blitz. Each enemy you come across will be weak to a particular Battle Buddy, which will increase your damage and also work on breaking their guard. If you do attack enough to break their guard, it will stun them giving you a moment’s reprieve and a great opportunity to do some damage or a Buddy-specific super attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On top of this, you can combine all of your Battle Buddies to shield from attacks, with bonuses awarded for guarding just as an attack hits you, such as boosts to your various gauges. If an enemy is attempting to strike with an unblockable attack, which the game highlights with a red flash, you can even use your Unite Blitz&nbsp;just before it hits to perform a Unite Counter. Your Buddies can be killed though, so using these defensive abilities is integral to survival, as is running over to the little tykes if they’re stunned by an enemy. As a final trowel to your toolkit, you can also&nbsp;combine all of your creatures into one colossal creature with a Fusion to perform a devastating attack that behaves like a Final Fantasy summon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can shake up the gameplay in a variety of ways, the biggest of which is by changing your loadout of Buddies, of which you can even fine-tune how many of each you will bring into battle with you. You can also change your leader, which grants different skills that can be used in battle such as making it easier to inflict debuffs. Finally, each dungeon allows you to choose your way through to some extent and whether you wish to prioritise items, party buffs, or enemy encounters, so you really need to go out of your way to have two runs of a dungeon that are completely identical.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">This sounds very involved, and it is for a time, in the early parts of the game as you gain new types of Buddy and enhance the types you have already. Sadly, most aspects of the gameplay mentioned previously quickly become dull or don’t add much diversity to the game. For example, the dungeons themselves, although technically randomised, aren’t quite randomised enough, leaving each one feeling exactly like the last with maybe a new aesthetic identity to represent a new area i.e. a jungle or a swamp. That’s made worse by them each consistently ending in a remarkably similar-looking open area for their end-of-stage boss encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Speaking of which, even the aesthetics of Farmagia don’t claw it out of the doldrums for me. I’ll concede that the various creatures are adorable, and I will never quite get over seeing the little wolves be pulled from what look like stalks of corn, but the characters play into a particular design philosophy that doesn’t gel with me. In other words, if you like your male characters to look generic as all sin, but your female characters having so much care in their design that they look like they’re from a different game entirely by comparison – you won’t have the same problem as I do here. But I’ll be the first to admit I’m just not a big-breasted anime girl kind of person.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> is set to release in March 2025 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC with full cross-play. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 will also have closed beta tests, with<a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">&nbsp;sign-ups here</a> on the Killing Floor site.</p>
<p>The trailer takes us to Texas, where a zed outbreak has consumed a Horzine facility, and your of Nightfall characters will need to head in and clear things up.</p>
<p>It gives a first look at the Ninja, Medic and Sharpshooter character classes, as well as a glimpse of the Chimera boss.</p>

<p>These days, character classes also need to have, well, a character attached to them, and so we meet Luna as the Sharpshooter, whose rifles have high damage and penetration, with skills that can pivot her character from precision to run and gun marksman. Her gadget is the Death’s Hand, an explosive homing arrow.<i></i></p>
<p>Obi is the medic, who was fired from Horzine for being too ethical and not profitable enough. He keeps teammates alive with healing darts and grenades, pivoting character build from self preservation to healing allies. His gadget is Sanctum, a field projector that heals allies, while damaging and slowing enemies.&nbsp;<i></i></p>
<p>Finally there’s Nakata the ninja assassin, joining Nightfall to atone for his former sins. With swords and bows, he’s a melee specialist that can block and parry larger enemies, but can pivot from front line melee combat to more nimble hit and run tactics. His gadget is the Hebi-ken grappling hook, which can amp up attacks if you grapple to enemies.</p>
<p>There are six specialists with the game at launch, with the first three having been <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/news/nightfall-news-specialist-deep-dive/">revealed back in October</a>. These included Foster the Commando, Devlin the Firebug and Imran the Engineer.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, with the not too surprising news that their RPG sequel is also coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, in 2025. Oh, and day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, of course.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the notion of Xbox exclusivity for this game has been vented out the airlock, though that’s fairly sensible in this case. Microsoft acquired the studio back in 2018, but chose not to buy out the publishing deal with Private Division, which allowed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> to release cross-platform across PS4, Xbox One and PC. The Outer Worlds 2 is Xbox published, but…. well, Xbox is effectively giving up on platform exclusivity. It’s not clear if this will be a simultaneous release, but there’s nothing to suggest timed exclusivity in this instance.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature within the Secret Level anthology series on Amazon Prime Video this month, with an episode dedicated to this universe to debut on 17th December, featuring a short story that takes place between the events of&nbsp;The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only Obsidian game out next year, with the tongue being removed from cheek for their more serious fantasy RPG adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed, coming out in February</a>. The Outer Worlds 2 will be a nice tonal companion to that!</p>
