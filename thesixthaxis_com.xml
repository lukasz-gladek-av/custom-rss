		<p>Futurlab’s CEO Kirsty Rigden has announced that the studio will be stopping support of PowerWash Simulator VR, noting that it is costing more to continue supporting the game than it brings in. As a result the team behind PowerWash Simulator VR will be moved to other projects within the studio, to fill gaps that were being advertised. The full statement can from Kirsty can be read below.</p>

<p><em>“Dear VR Washers,&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I am sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now. We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects. We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator VR on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team. Every time. While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position you would have made the same decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsty Rigden, CEO, Futurlab</em></p>

<p>FuturLab has made a proper go of supporting PowerWash Simulator VR, with having regularly released new content for it including the SpongeBob Squarepants and Back to the Future packs. The decision to protect jobs in an industry that has seen thousands lose their jobs, with studios shutting down at a high rate, is one that is understandable.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator VR review, Dom said, <em>“Powerwash Simulator VR is the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</em></p>
