		<p>If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see. Originally released in 2024, this hybrid RTS/autobattler – with a smidgen of deckbuilding – boasts some truly incredible art nouveau visual design. Characters, artwork, and the different unit classes, sing out from the screen, blessing you with their stunning, evocative looks. Luckily for us, the beautiful action doesn’t have to finish quite yet, with the huge Celestial Church DLC arriving today, bringing with it a host of much-requested features. </p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence: Celestial Church - Official DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mT-oJ5C8-a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The and biggest and brightest inclusion is six all-new singleplayer campaign chapters, the six-hour-long additions furthering the story and deepening Songs of Silence’s lore, bringing all that incredible artwork to life in a more meaningful way than ever before. </p>
<p>There’s then the addition of a new faction, the titular Celestial Church, who in turn have brought a host of new units, abilities and cards to bear on the battlefield. I can’t wait to test them all out in the coming days.</p>
<p>The expansion was shaped by recurring community requests for additional story-focused experiences. Throughout its development, Songs of Silence has evolved hand-in-hand with player feedback gathered from open betas, surveys, and daily conversations between the team and the community. It’s not about to stop here either, with Chimera confirming that another expansion is planned for mid-2026, accompanied by numerous additional features that will arrive beforehand.</p>

<p>“Players asked for deeper narrative experiences, and the Celestial Church expansion is our answer to that call,” said Songs of Silence’s Executive Producer, Hendrik Lesser. “We’re excited to keep enriching the game and delivering meaningful content for years to come.”</p>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/">Songs of Silence</a> at launch, and of course, I was utterly taken by the visuals, saying, “Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.”</p>

		<p>I don’t think it is too much of a surprise that Nacon has confirmed Terminator: Survivors will not be releasing in 2025 given how close we are to the end of the year, and the lack of news over the past while. Nacon has also stated there is no confirmed new release date, and there will be some changes to the game too. The major changes are that Terminator: Survivors will now not have a co-op multiplayer mode, and there will be no Early Access. Instead, Nacon is changing its plans to release the game in full in one go.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator: Survivors | The Aftermath Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LepEDOgw0Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Nacon said, <em>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. We know this may come as a disappointment, but&nbsp;we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access,&nbsp;we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience. You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date. <wbr>Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so&nbsp;we’ll be organizing several closed playtests&nbsp;(under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors,&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.nacongaming.com%2Fplaytests">you can sign up here</a>.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator: Survivors is a sequel to Terminator 2. The story is set in 2009, a time before John Connor’s resistance has risen up against the machines. You are a survivor and do not have much information as to what brought about the apocalypse. However, as you build up your base and scavenge through the surrounding areas, the narrative running through the game will see you learn about SkyNet, about the emerging resistance and more. The game has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
