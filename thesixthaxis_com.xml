		<p>Just last week, TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/13/of-ash-and-steel-will-launch-on-november-6th/">Of Ash and Steel would launch on November 6th,</a> but what a difference a week makes. However, after some more testing the development team has discovered some issues that need additional work, so Of Ash and Steel will not make the November 6th date as planned. The delay is not too long though, with Fire &amp; Frost confirming that the new date is now November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team wrote, <em>“Right now, we are in the active phase of testing the game before its release, making sure your journey across the island will be as smooth and bug-free as possible. Originally, we announced that your adventure would begin on November 6. However, during testing, our teams discovered several issues that require more time to fix than we initially expected. We’ll need a few extra weeks to properly address these issues. The new release date for Of Ash and Steel is now November 24th, 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Announcing the release date was one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking moments of development, because deep down we feared something like this might happen at the very last moment. And… it did! Hopefully, you haven’t booked your vacation around the release just yet. We sincerely apologize for this short delay, and hope you’ll understand our decision. Finally, for those who haven’t tried the demo yet — good news! It will remain available for a while longer, so you still have time to step onto Grayshaft and experience the first hours of your adventure. Thank you for your support, and we’ll see you (just a little later) on Grayshaft!”</em></p>

<p>Steam Next Fest was a success for Of Ash and Steel with the demo being one of the best performing demos, and the game has now been wishlishted over 220,000 times. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance. The demo features part of the main quest, side missions, professions, and upgrades.</p>
