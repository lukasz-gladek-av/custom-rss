		<p>I’ve never quite been clear when you’re allowed to break out the ol’ “pinch, punch, first of the month”. The rules always seem to be quite inconsistent. Is it any 1st of the month, or is it only from October onwards? And do you have to stop by midday, like with April Fools?</p>
<p>Anyway, spring has officially sprung, meteorologically speaking, and even though it’s still distinctly chilly a lot of the time, I’m definitely feeling the seasons shift. But this past week has seen the last throes of winter game launches, and one of the biggest games of the year is upon us all.</p>

<p>This week was all about Monster Hunter Wilds… or was it? That game is a truly fantastic new entry in what has become one of the biggest game franchise going, but there’s also the great new Two Point Museum, if you’d rather curate bones than hunt the creatures that own them…</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week? Well…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> completed Call of the Sea with his daughter, enjoying sovling the puzzles together. When the wee ones had gone to bed, he got stuck in with Resident Evil 3, though he’s sort of stuck just after the power station and keeps running into Nemesis….</li>
<li>And while&nbsp;<strong>TSBonyman</strong> patiently waits for Atomfall, he’s been putting more time into No Man’s Sky thanks to the Worlds 2 update.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Stardock has announced that it will be releasing the first paid DLC for Sins of a Solar Empire 2 on March 27th, and that DLC is called Path to Power. This new content will add more than 10 new scenario maps for players to navigate, with new objectives to tackle from defending your territory to assimilating other races into your own empire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sins of a Solar Empire II | Steam Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sbOAP-wKfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The ‘Paths to Power’ DLC lays the foundation for new, more dynamic styles of gameplay in the Sins’ universe,”</em> said Brian Clair, Executive Producer at Stardock. <em>“Not only will players get new experiences from this DLC, but modders will gain access to a whole new set of options to bring their creations to life.”</em></p>
<p>Three of the scenarios are ‘All As One’, ‘Defend the Homeworld, and ‘Scorched Space.’ In the ‘All As One’ scenario players take control of the Vasari Alliance which is facing a catastrophic event with planets disintegrating as an unknown force moves through the darkness. The objective is to escape but to do that the Vasari Alliance will need to gather resources and forge new relationships with other factions to help them. In ‘Defend the Homeworld’, players play as Pranast United which is under attack. There is no victory condition, as victory is impossible. The only goal is to see how long you can survive the waves of attack. In the ‘Scorched Space’ scenario, a new star system has been found that contains the remnants of an unknown race. There are two options in this scenario. Restore this lost technology for your own use, or destroy it to keep it out of the hands of other factions.</p>

<p>The paid content is not all that will be coming to Sins of a Solar Empire 2. Update 1.4 will change the relationship between population and culture, with a larger population making your empire more influential in the grand scheme of the game. There will be new units added as well and some balance changes too. Paths of Power has been priced at $12.99, but is also part of the Content Pass and the Premium edition at no additional cost.</p>
