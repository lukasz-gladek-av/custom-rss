		<p>Nintendo has revealed the release date and price for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the sequel to their hugely popular handheld set to launch on June 5th 2025.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 builds on the familiar design and features of the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console that can be used handheld, on TV or propped up on a tabletop, but that form has evolved. The screen is larger, the Joy-Con have a new connection style, and there’s some new functionality as well.</p>


<p>What they did not reveal is the price, but the official Switch 2 site goes live very shortly and that should have pre-orders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – Overview trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1-W7ZV0RNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The screen is now 1080p 7/9″ with up to 120fps with HDR support in compatible games and the buttons and sticks are larger than those found on the original console.&nbsp; The console also has 3D audio which will be supported via headphones, and via the speakers after an update. The storage has been upgraded to 256gb and if you use the docking station, which now includes a fan, games can be played in up to 4K.</p>

<p>The new Game cards are the same shape and size as Switch cards but have faster data transfer speeds, and you can only use MicroSD Express cards for expansions. There’s also a new Pro Controller for those who prefer a more traditional controller.</p>
<p>Game Share is a new feature in which compatible games can be shared with four players for local multiplayer, so only one person needs to own the game.&nbsp; Switch 2 will also get a Nintendo Online expansion pack that gives you a bunch of older games including&nbsp; Wind Waker, SoulCalibur 2, and F-Zero X.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 now features optical sensors, so that they can be used like a computer mouse when propped up on their side, and this has some niche gaming potential. Additionally, there’s a new C-button on the right Joy-Con, which is used for Game Chat which is exactly what you would expect, online chat with up to four other players via the microphone in the console. You can use the feature even if you are playing different games and It also lets you share your screen with other players, although the frame rate is very low. There’s also a new Nintendo Switch 2 camera which you can use to put yourself on screen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing GameChat (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiLqwWgejrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Nintendo Direct stream, we got a good look at some of the games that are set to launch for Nintendo Switch 2. These include the long awaited <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-9">Mario Kart 9, aka Mario Kart World</a>. The presentation started with a look at the game with twenty-four of your favourite characters racing about on karts, jetskis,&nbsp; planes, and bikes. Some Switch games will be getting an upgrade to a Switch 2 version, such as Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition, and you will be able to upgrade by purchasing as pack – no free upgrades here.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING is coming to Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGAaGwQIDoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>The big reveal was a new game from FromSoftware, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/fromsoftware-announce-the-duskbloods-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> that will arrive in 2026 as a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>
<p>The 60 minute presentation featured a bunch of new games and announcements, and many of these will be on show over the coming weeks and days. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Live public events start on Friday 4th April in Paris and New York</a>, before the travelling show heads to other countries and cities around the world through the end of May.&nbsp; One of the games, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour lets you wander around&nbsp; the inside of the console and explains all the functions.&nbsp; It is packed with mini games that let you explore the console functions.</p>
<p>Nintendo is breaking out the Nintendo Treehouse Live for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 3rd and 4th April, bringing gameplay deep dives to the masses following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct stream taking place tomorrow, on 2nd April.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Treehouse Live broadcasts will start at 3PM UK time – 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 4PM CEST – and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica/streams">watch both of them on YouTube</a>. It’s not clear how long they will run for through the day, but as they will be running in tandem with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">live hands on events taking place in New York and Paris</a>, we can expect them to run for several hours with numerous different segments.</p>

<p>A new mode called Bowser Live will integrate the camera into play. Here your body movements and sound can be used to hit blocks, guide an RC car and more depending on camera use. Mouse controls can then be used on a rollercoaster ride to shoot enemies, to control a spray can, and plenty more.</p>

<p>Civ 7 will have mouse controls.</p>
