		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>

		<p>There’s tons of big games arriving a moment to appeal to all sorts of gamers, whether it’s Ghost of Yotei’s launch for PlayStation fans this week, picking up on the excellent Hades 2 from last week, celebrating Mario’s 40th with the Galaxy and Galaxy 2 remaster, or hopping into shooty bang bang stuff with the Black Ops 7 beta, just ahead of next week’s Battlefield 6 launch.</p>
<p>It’s quite the time, and I’ve been playing some of these headline-grabbing games this past week!</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> jumped between two strikingly different games, with his review of the sportball-filled EA Sports FC 26 and the toon-filled action RPG Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny. Another huge shift comes with Jim’s gaming, who wrapped up a review of UBOAT, which put him in command of a German submarine during WW2 –&nbsp;“It’s a fascinating sim though one that comes with a steep learning curve, requiring patience and attention to detail.” He’s now moving on to Ghost of Yotei and the Black Ops 7 beta for this weekend’s gaming action.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hoovering up slime poops otherwise known as “plorts”, and then selling them for cold hard cash and upgrades in Slime Rancher 2. She’s also been “finding every opportunity to launch myself across the screen”, while playing Absolum for review alongside <strong>Ade</strong>. Her other half has added Marvel Rivals and Hades 2 alongside that, the latter of which he reckons is both bigger and better than the original.</p>


<p><strong>Jason</strong> thoroughly enjoyed his time reviewing Digimon Story Time Stranger –&nbsp;why did they ditch the colon for the middle of that game name? I don’t know –&nbsp;and has also falledn back into Vampire Survivors to go along with more lootering and shootering in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It was a big bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics this past week for <strong>Nic</strong>, but he has also been jumping into a different tactical game for review, and is looking forward to telling everyone a bit more. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got a few hours in with Robocop: Rogue City Unfinished Business and finds it still to be both very enjoyable and old fashioned. “You don’t need to think too much,” he said, “it’s just reactions and exploding heads, and sometimes that’s all you need.”</p>

<p>While he continues his recovery, <strong>Steve</strong> has been building up his gaming stamina with a little bit of Silent Hill f, “which is brilliantly atmospheric”. He also finished Breath of Fire II and made a start on III, which is tickling the nostalgia bits of his brain.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom</strong> returned to the UK and has been playing a bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics for himself, mixing in some NBA 2K26 and Madden 26, and making a start on Hades 2!</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>
