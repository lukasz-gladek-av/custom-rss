		<p>We all love a new MMORPG, but what about testing a new one out before it launches? Chinese publisher Netease are on something of a tear lately, with the recent launches of Destiny: Legacy and Fragpunk sitting alongside huge hits like the Overwatch-eradicating Marvel Rivals. While they remain mobile specialists, Sword of Justice is a brand new Chinese-influenced MMORPG which is coming to both mobile platforms and PC, and it’s looking spectacular. If MMORPGs are your sort of thing, as of today you can <a href="https://qnv2.ux-jp-01.easebar.com/qnv2/a553d3e2-50a1-4860-8f35-3f9aef06139e/?shortlink=cdens2o1&amp;c=PR%20Pitch&amp;pid=CBT%20PR%20Pitch&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui#/">sign up for the upcoming closed beta</a> which starts on the 26th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sword of Justice - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ob_tjShS5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by ZhuRong Studio, as the team head towards Sword of Justice’s international launch, the Closed Beta Test will take place on a North-American server, with players from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil able to experience the game. The Closed Beta Test will start on September 26th at 10:30 AM EDT and you can <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/1/messages/AOp8cjmuZ2gpK30GMV29XNhi5Ng?.intl=uk&amp;.lang=en-GB#:~:text=https%3A//swordofjustice.onelink.me/PNY2/cdens2o1">sign up for the beta</a> until September 16th at 11:59 AM EDT.</p>
<p>Sword of Justice is an open world MMORPG for PC and mobile devices that’s completely free to play, with the team promising that there are no pay-to-win elements. Set in a world inspired by the Northern Song Dynasty in 12th-century China, Sword of Justice allows players to live out their martial arts dreams in a stunning Eastern aesthetic world. It does look deeply impressive, and, as we’re seeing with titles like Infinity Nikki, mobile games are pushing the envelope in terms of gameplay and visuals to a point where they sit happily alongside fully fledged consoles.</p>


<p>A major feature that players can experience in the Sword of Justice Closed Beta Test is the implementation of path tracing on PC and ray tracing on mobile devices. Path-tracing is a visually stunning effect, offering near-photorealistic reflections and lighting. Coupled with the game’s dynamic weather system, Sword of Justice offers gorgeous visuals that they liken to CGI movies, providing an ultra-realistic presentation of its world. If your phone is up to snuff, it’s well worth checking out, just to see how far the technology has come.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more, there’s plenty of information on the <a href="http://swordofjustice.com/en/index.html">official website</a>. We’ll definitely be watching this one with interest!</p>
