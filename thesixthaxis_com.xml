		<p>Anything can be a game these days: Squirrel with a gun? Sure. Pigeon dating sim? Yep. Power washing a garage? A mega hit! Binary Impact and publisher Aerosoft have decided that car parks are not getting the love they deserve and have created a game specifically for that experience.</p>
<p>Parking World is a builder and economy simulator which provides a “dynamic experience” where players will focus on the creation, design and management of parking lots big and small, as well as the facilities around them. You can see in the trailer that you can go in to the smallest detail including working out all the pipes for the toilets.</p>


<p>Car parks <em>and</em> plumbing – what could be sexier?</p>
<p><iframe title="Parking World | Release Trailer | OUT NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C94XnE2rPE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Take on the role of a parking lot management professional. With both quests and freeplay mode, one can start their journey creating modest parking areas in support of local entrepreneurs, and expand their operations to include vast, multi-level parking facilities to serve malls and cities, should government officials grant you the job,” say Aerosoft. “The game challenges players to master planning, space and economic strategies, ensuring each parking venue operates smoothly regardless of the events or influx of users it encounters.”</p>

<p>The game has launched today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551570/Parking_World_Build__Manage/">Steam</a> for PC in Early Access for 19,99€ with a 10% discount during first week after release.</p>
