		<p>Bon Voyage Charms and Bon Voyage Charms L.E. are the Gacha currency for NetEase’s new game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising">Destiny: Rising</a>. In other words, these are what you need to use to unlock extra characters and other bonuses. As the game has just launched, there are lots of ways to get Bon Voyage Charms for free.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms</h3>
<p>The easiest and quickest way right now is to play the PvP and PvPvE activities which are Singularity and Shifting Gates. There are daily limits on the rewards, but Singularity currently has a load of special first-time completion rewards that can be won to earn Bon Voyage Charms. You will also need to spend some Pinnacle Energy to play Singularity, that currency has a max of 360 and you earn 120 every day, and a run of Singularity will cost you 20 Pinnacle Energy.</p>
<p>You can also buy Bon Voyage Charms from a number of places. You can get them by exchanging 180 Lumia Leaves, another currency that can be earned in game, or for Translation Credits which are earned when playing Shifting Gates, and finally you can exchange Crystal Dust for them in the Fortuna shop.</p>



<p>As mentioned, there are lots of other ways to earn Bon Voyage charms during the launch window, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Weekly Sign-in Bonus</li>
<li>The “Spreading Light” referral program, invite pals and earn Bon Voyage charms as they level up.</li>
<li>Character Quests</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Chapter Objectives</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Destination Exploration and Destination Reputation Rewards</li>
<li>Pre-registration rewards : If you did sign up before the game launched, you should have some Charms waiting for you when you log in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can keep track of many of the Rewards by going to the Events page and tapping on the Rewards Guide. You can also track Lumia Leaf rewards here, which can be turned in to Bon Voyage Charms.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms L.E.</h3>
<p>For Bon Voyage Charms L.E. (Limited Edition) you are probably going to have to get your wallet out. These can only be used to claim characters who are available for a limited time. They can be bought via a number of methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the Fortuna Shop where you can purchase them using Silver</li>
<li>As Rewards from the Premium Battle Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also exchange Fortuna Crystals and Fortuna Crystal dust for Bon Voyage Charms L.E. but you need rather a lot and you can only do this five times a month.</p>
