		<p>I’m looking forward to a weekend filled with a bunch of squad-based shooter action, with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a>. There’s always a bit of a disconnect between playing shooters for review, where I’m turning on streamer modes to hide user names and being a lone wolf most of the time, and then playing after release where I can join a party and voice chat.</p>
<p>But that’s not all I’ll be playing, because I’ve still got reviews of the daft walking simulator Baby Steps and the UGC dungeon crawler King of Meat to finally wrap up.</p>

<p>It’s been a big jumble of games for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, who’s returned to Atomfall: The Red Strain DLC, and had Dreams of Another and Rise of Industry on the go for upcoming reviews. Add some spooky fun times with Phasmophobia, wand waving in Beat Saber and some VR shooty stuff in Synapse, and he’s had a busy gaming week!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong>, meanwhile, reviewed the decidedly average <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/blood-of-mehran-review/">Blood of Mehran</a>, and swiftly went back to Ghost of Yotei to mop up the last few things he needed to grab the platinum trophy! After all that modern gaming, he needed something a bit older, with Dark Void and Spec Ops: The Line – “Dark Void is very average but had some fun ideas though the aerial combat induced some motion sickness. Spec Ops The Line holds up well with the messaging relevant as ever.”</p>


<p>Always finding new beat ’em ups to batter around, <strong>Ade</strong> played the “rogue ’em up” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>. It’s not perfect, but “It’s a really fun game, well worth a look, even with a few too many issues holding it back from greatness.” To make up for those weaknesses, he also played more Hades 2. And when not playing Absolum with Ade, <strong>Laura</strong> has been ” Hoovering slimes, and solving ghost crimes” in Slime Rancher 2 and Banishers.</p>
<p>With Battlefield 6 on his horizon, <strong>Jim</strong> booted up Battlefield 1 and immediately got his butt kicked. So he played Ghost of Yotei, and has thoroughly enjoyed his time with it – “I dig the freefrom structure which was interestingly a complaint I had about Assassin’s Creed Shadows.”</p>

<p>It was a bunch more Digimon Story Time Stranger for <strong>Jason</strong>, who says it’s up there as his Game of the Year. “Something I didn’t mention in the review is how good the grind is once you hit just before the end game, as you can just hop around in the story grinding and doing side quests.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying By Sweet Carole’s Gothic Disney vibes, and revisiting Yooka-Replaylee which, aside from the poor title, promises a lot of improvements over the original version. And then, of course, there’s been a ton of Steam Next Fest demos ahead of next week, and a bunch of indie horror games for this time of year!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>
