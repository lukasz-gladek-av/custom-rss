		<p>EA’s latest financial report has confirmed their plans for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield</a> game. Having already started <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/">closed public playtesting</a> earlier this year, the next Battlefield will be revealed this summer. Additionally, the game is still on target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">a release in fiscal year 26</a>, which ends at the start of April 2026, meaning that it will beat GTA 6 to market – a title that EA was doing their best to avoid.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, said, “As we look to the future, we’re confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline — beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment.”</p>


<p>In following statements during a Q&amp;A with investors, Wilson added “Relative to Battlefield, what we have said all along is we’ve been building towards a window that we thought made the most sense for Battlefield, but we wouldn’t launch into a window that we thought truncated the value that we’ve invested into the franchise, or the value that we think our players will derive from it once they jump in and start playing.</p>
<p>“I think now, without going too far, we believe that window is clearer than it was before and we feel very good about launching Battlefield in [financial year] 2026.”</p>
<p>He is, of course, referring to GTA 6 having vacated this fiscal year. Take-Two had repeatedly stated that GTA 6 was on target for a release before the end of 2025, but has now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">pushed GTA 6’s launch back by around half a year with a 26th May 2026 release date</a>. EA have always stated that the next Battlefield is aiming for a FY26 release, giving them flexibility to avoid GTA 6 if it had launched this year. It’s likely that EA were targeting the end of 2025 to try and snatch the Christmas spending rush, but with leeway to fall back to the following year if it was advantageous, or they could have always had early 2026 in the crosshairs.</p>

<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced the founding of teamLFG, a new studio within PlayStation Studios that’s formed around an incubation project and team that was formerly a part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a>.</p>
<p>While the team is formed around that core of ex-Bungie developers, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst explains that it “has also rallied developers from across the industry”.</p>


<p>Furthermore, teamLFG explains a little of what their game will be. Their first title will take inspiration from “fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.”</p>
<p>Here’s teamLFG’s announcement letter:</p>
<p>“Hello, world. It’s a delight to meet you, and we’re very grateful to be joining PlayStation Studios.</p>

<p>Our studio is headquartered in Bellevue, WA, with team members working both on-site and remotely throughout the U.S. and Canada. We are a team composed not just of industry veterans who have shipped titles like Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite, Roblox, and Rec Room, but also industry newcomers with fresh creative perspectives and skills. We are passionate about exceptional action-based gameplay, moment-to-moment game feel, and richly social virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The “LFG” in “teamLFG” stands for “Looking For Group.” We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team – dat’s da good stuff.</p>
<p>We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests. It’s critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come.</p>
<p>Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe. We can’t wait to reveal more.</p>
<p>‘Til then, we’ll do our best! Thanks for reading.”</p>
<p>– teamLFG</p>
<p>This new studio branched off from Bungie last August, amidst turmoil at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer. With Destiny 2 underperforming and a good long time still to go before the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> – now set for release in a few months from now – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons enacted a round of layoffs</a> that cut hundreds of jobs and moved even more across to the rest of PlayStation Studios. One Destiny 2 spin-off, codenamed Payback, was cancelled at that time, while a team of around 40 were to form a new studio and continue working on an “incubation project”. That team has now become teamLFG.</p>
