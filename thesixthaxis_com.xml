		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>
