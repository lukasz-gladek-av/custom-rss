		<p>Respawn has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> will end support for the original Nintendo Switch with Season 29, meaning that the game will no longer be playable on that platform when Season 30 debuts on 4th August 2026.</p>
<p>While Apex Legends is leaving the older hybrid handheld behind, the game has had a native port for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> since last August, and cross-progression via an EA account means that player progress, purchases and unlocks can be carried over. Even so, the ability to buy in-game currency on Switch is being removed.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/10/apex-legends-switch-worth-playing-resolution-frame-rate-crossplay-graphics/">Apex Legends dropped onto Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>, and was another example of getting something that shouldn’t really run to work on the mobile chipset inside. It was a necessarily compromised experience in terms of resolution (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/09/apex-legends-nintendo-switch-resolution-and-frame-rate-when-is-it-out/">topping out at 720p docked and 576p handheld</a>) and frame rate (only shooting for 30fps). With the native Switch 2 version, all of that is dramatically improved to run at 60 fps and with 1080p docked and 1008p handheld.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement from social media:</p>
<p>Hey legends, we want to share an important update about Apex Legends on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. Future seasons of Apex Legends will continue to be available on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), Apex Legends will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system.</li>
<li>Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.</li>
<li>Beginning August 4, 2026, in-game premium currency will no longer be available for purchase on Nintendo Switch, though any existing balances can still be used before August 4, 2026. Players can use any existing balances from Nintendo Switch on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
<li>All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts. Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026. Please note that in some regions, local laws require you to use digital currency within 180 days of purchase.</li>
<li>All the above only applies to Nintendo Switch and not Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apex Legends will continue to be available on all other supported platforms. As we continue to evolve Apex Legend’s content and technical foundation, our goal is to deliver a high quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the Nintendo community that has been with us on this journey since Day 1, and we hope to see you on the Dropship on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
