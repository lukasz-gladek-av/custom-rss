		<p>Summer Gamesfest continues with the first proper look at ILL,a narrative-driven first-person survival horror game that transports you to a sinister settlement where the inhabitants have gone bonkers, removed most of their clothes and want to eat your face, so a bit like Liverpool city centre at 4am.</p>
<p><iframe title="ILL - Official Gameplay Trailer (New Photo Realistic Horror FPS)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0OuzKYGRVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s more from the Steam page for the game:</p>
<p>“Prepare to embrace new boundaries of horror. ILL offers a visceral and realistic depiction of body horror: disgusting, monstrous creatures can be gruesomely dismembered and traumatized. Torn flesh, exposed bones, and gutted organs—all combine to create an unprecedented and vicious experience that will leave you breathless.”</p>
<p>“Your enemies are cunning and unpredictable. They don’t remain in a constant state of attack but suffer pain and react to all manner of events. Hits on different enemy body parts elicit unique reactions, replete with animations and visual effects. Enemies’ appearance will vary with diverse textures, proportions, and animations — you’ll never know what twisted form your adversaries will take next.”</p>

<p>“Experience a comprehensive weapon system where malfunction checks, ammunition types, and mandatory maintenance are crucial. Feel the weight and realism of each weapon in the protagonist’s hands, thanks to procedural animation that considers physical characteristics. The game’s world offers a range of ammo and weapon upgrades, demanding strategic choices for survival. Stay sharp, as every decision can mean the difference between life and death.”</p>
<p>“ILL will captivate you with its physically believable world, teeming with rich possibilities of interaction. Manipulate objects, navigate through intricate levels, and experience the consequential effects of real-world physics in gameplay and combat. This means the game’s world is not just a backdrop but an integral part of the gameplay experience, drawing you deeper into the terrifying reality of the town and its deadly creatures.”</p>
<p>ILL will launch on PC, no console versions have been announced yet.</p>

		<p>On their last night together, three friends embark on one final adventure and you get to play it all while listening to an era-defining collection of songs from the likes of DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, the Cure and many more.</p>
<p><iframe title="MIXTAPE | Summer Game Fest 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“En route to their final party together, a perfectly curated playlist draws three friends into dreamlike reenactments of their formative memories. Experience a variety of narrative vignettes exploring the pivotal moments that shaped them. Players will immerse themselves in the teenage wasteland by playing through a mixtape of joyful gameplay, from skateboarding and flying to taking photos after hours at an abandoned theme park, hitting baseballs, and putting on a fireworks show from the backseat of a car. It’s the greatest hits of the teenage experience, from the first kiss to the last dance.”</p>
<p>“From Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, developers of BAFTA award-winning game The Artful Escape, Mixtape draws inspiration from classic coming-of-age movies, bringing together nostalgic aimlessness, mischief, music, the highs and lows of adolescence, and the bittersweet feelings brought about by growth, transformation, and moving on.”</p>

<p>Mixtape is coming soon on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
