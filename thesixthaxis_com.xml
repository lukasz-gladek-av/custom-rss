		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is swinging its way to release this month on 28th February (and with a week of Early Access starting on Friday 21st), but what comes after that? 2K and HB Studios have now revealed what players can expect with the post-launch seasons of content and the Clubhouse Pass of free and premium rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Developer Diary #3 I Seasons &amp; Clubhouse Pass I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LqpJ9SmtIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Each season will bring free new courses, quests, challenges and a fresh track of rewards in a Clubhouse Pass. Season 2, for example, will bring The Old Course at St. Andrews Links to all players for free, for example.</p>
<p>For PGA Tour 2K25, Seasons will be tied to the five MyPlayer archteypes, with Technicians set to feature in Season 1, before the Greenskeeper, Magician, Powerhouse and Sculptor get to take the spotlight through the five planned seasons of content. Each one lends itself to a different playstyle, so it could be a bit sucky if you’re best with an archetype that’s fourth or fifth in line.</p>
<p>Each Season’s Clubhouse Pass will be aligned with real-life golf tournaments and events. This will bring 100 tiers of rewards – up from 50 tier in PGA Tour 2K23 – with 34 of these having free rewards that will includ Club fittings, evo tools, level up tokens, equipment, apparel and more. Paying for the Premium pass or having the Member’s Pass from the Legend Edition of the game, will get you rewards at all 100 tiers.</p>

<p>In a nice move, following in the footsteps of a handful of other battle pass-laden games, you can take this at your own pace. Progress through a Clubhouse Pass can continue even after later seasons have been released, cutting down on the FOMO.</p>

		
		

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC, with a free First Look demo available now. This lets eager golfers check out the MyPlayer customisation, to create up to three player builds with custom appearance, hair, archetype, stats, gear and apparel, and progress up to a 70 OVR rating. There’s the Local Match mode featuring the back nine of TPC Scottsdale and WM Phoenix Open, Training mode and a Quests mode for player onboarding and skills development.</p>
<p>Any progress in the First Look demo carries on to the full game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/nintendo-ditches-gold-points-reward-scheme-ahead-of-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced an end to their My Nintendo Gold Points reward scheme, ending what was a nice little cashback bonus for purchases on the eShop in the run up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch.</p>
<p>From 25th March 2025, you will no longer earn Gold Points when making digital purchases from the eShop or when redeeming download codes. After that point, you’ll have up to 12 months from the date you earned any points to spend them on the eShop.</p>


<p>There’s further exceptions to this cut off date, as any physical games that were released prior to 25th March will still have a Gold Points redemption available to them for up to 2 years from their original release date. Any digital pre-orders placed before 25th March will also award points at the time that the purchase is completed – cancelling a pre-order will obviously exclude you from earning those points.</p>
<p>For full details, <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">visit the My Nintendo announcement.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/08/youll-soon-be-able-to-use-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-the-nintendo-switch-eshop/">Introduced back in 2018</a>, Nintendo Gold Points award 5% of the amount you pay when purchasing digital content, and 1% redeemed from physical games, which can then be used to fund further purchases of digital software and DLC via the eShop. It’s been a great incentive over the past 7 years, putting a few coins back into your pocket and encouraging you to keep spending and/or subsidising that next big game launch.</p>

<p>Nintendo has decided to cancel the programme practically on the eve of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal</a> and expected release. With rumours that Nintendo could push for higher game prices, and the huge player base that the Switch has going into the console transition, this kind of scheme isn’t needed anymore – it was a sweetener to help fuel platform growth after the disappointment of the Wii U.</p>
<p>Other rumours and speculation suggest that Nintendo could also be planning for a price increase for Nintendo Switch Online, and it’s entirely possible that they reconsider or restrict <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Exclusive-benefits/Exclusive-benefits-Nintendo-Switch-Online-2719183.html">the Switch game vouchers benefit for subscribers</a>, which allows you to spend £84 to get two vouchers for certain first party and exclusive games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mario’s been spotted running around in a pair of swimming short on his way to a McDuck-like vault filled with all those gold coins he no longer needs to share!</p>
