		<p>WRC has announced a new licensing partnership with Nacon, granting them exclusive rights to develop and publish the official WRC games and run esports competitions for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032.</p>
<p>The news comes not long after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">EA announced that they were giving up on the WRC license</a> after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">one game</a> (albeit with a year of additional content added) and halting the development of rally games in general. While no studio has been confirmed, it’s likely that Nacon will entrust the license to KT Racing once more, the studio having previously made the official WRC game series from 2015 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/wrc-generations-will-be-nacons-last-rally-racer-with-the-license/">through 2022</a>.</p>


<p>This is described as being “an all-new WRC game series” that is “a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision, and marks an ambitious new chapter in the brand’s development.”</p>
<p>That’s not entirely surprising given how long it will have been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/wrc-generations-review/">since WRC Generations</a>. Launched in 2022, the game was a greatest hits of sorts for KT Racing’s WRC series, launching across generations and with the then incoming Rally1 hybrid cars as the headline act. A few years on an WRC has ditched hybrid engines from Rally1, and there would be further changes by 2027.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter. This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans,” said Alain Falc, CEO of NACON. “Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship’s official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights.”</p>

<p>“After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with NACON,” expressed FIA World Rally Championship’s Chief Marketing Officer Arne Dirks. “Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today.”</p>
<p>It’s great to see WRC and rally gaming continue, after a few years that could be seen as lost to fans of the racing sub-genre. Codemasters’ game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">EA Sports WRC</a>, was a good effort, though it brought new technical challenges as the studio adapted to Unreal Engine 4, and clearly didn’t sell enough copies to keep EA invested in the license or genre of racing. It certainly feels like Codemasters might have pushed to acquire the license to make themselves more attractive as an acquisition target, eventually being folded into EA Sports.</p>
<p>In the meantime, KT Racing had the difficult final stretch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> development and a fraught release, and has Endurance Motorsport Series in development, expected for later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Card games are nothing new in the world of Final Fantasy. Cloud had Queen’s Bloom and Zidane had Tetra Master. Now, despite the existence of a Final Fantasy TCG, you can play <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/166/triple-triad">Triple Triad</a> in your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fca/22/danitha-capashen-paragon">Squall</a> deck in Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, MTG is Hasbro’s biggest moneyspinner. Historically, we see a new set of cards released every few months, exploring a different plane of existence. You are a Planeswalker, pulling creatures and spells from across the planes to do battle with your opponent. With the 2021 launch of the Universes Beyond crossover series, this has meant that pretty much any IP is fair game.</p>
<p>Want to launch your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/139/gilgamesh-master-at-arms">Gilgamesh</a> into battle wielding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/239/glamdring">Glamdring</a> and Ezio’s <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/73/hidden-blade">Hidden Blade</a>? Go for it, but why stop there, when you can also give it a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/138/nuka-nuke-launcher">Nuka-Nuke Launcher</a> and an Astartes <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/40k/159/inquisitorial-rosette">Inquisitorial Rosette</a>?</p>
<p>Oh no, my immersion!</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY | Official Trailer | Magic: The Gathering" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSDvLerVcNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These Universes Beyond crossovers are a very sore point for a subset of the community, scared and angry that their wizardy card game is being infiltrated by a someone who lives in a pineapple under the sea. To this, I would say Magic has always been a silly game, the idea of visiting other planes is baked into the very fabric of not only the lore, but the actual back of a Magic card. And to Gilgamesh specifically, this goofball is known specifically for jumping between worlds, looking for epic weapons.</p>

<p>So, to all the Final Fantasy players psyched to get their hands on some new cards depicting their favourite moments from their favourite games, I say welcome. Pull up a chair and we’ll play some games with some very silly cardboard. Not only are these cards powerfully designed, they’re thematically on point.</p>

<p>The only problem is that Final Fantasy MTG cards are virtually impossible to get hold of. A cursory glance online shows that preorders are either sold out or ludicrously expensive. Talking to shop owners, they tell me that the amount of product they have requested from their suppliers is nowhere near the amount they’ve been promised. One owner I spoke to said that he was offered just over a dozen prerelease packs for an upcoming tournament, with a comment about how he should look forward to bringing in new members of the community with it. The sarcasm almost bleeds off the page.</p>
<p>However, the fact remains: Wizards of the Coast has not printed enough product for the demand we’re seeing. The set releases in June and it was already declared MTG’s best-selling set of all time in an investors’ call on April 24th. Imagine how much it would have sold if vendors could actually promise stock…</p>
<p>Fans are both worried and optimistic. Optimistic because this is a Standard-legal set, meaning that Wizards of the Coast will continue printing it for years to come, which will help increase supply and stave off scalpers in the long run. This is especailly important now, as the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-final-fantasy">MSRP</a> for this set is significantly higher than it is for ‘normal’ MTG sets.&nbsp;WotC’s <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magic-returns-to-listing-msrp-with-foundations">official MSRP for a normal Standard-legal booster</a> is $5.49, with a full 100-card Commander deck costing $44.99. For Final Fantast, this jumps up to $6.99 and $69.99, respectively.</p>
<div id="attachment_459910"><p id="caption-attachment-459910">Image credit: Wizards of the Coast, Square Enix – Illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano, Toni Infante, Kota Nakatsubo, Ezoi</p></div>
<p>So now we have a weird push–pull scenario. We have a cool new crossover set designed to attract new players, but in targeting the potential whales in the FF Fandom, existing players are being priced out and sidelined. This is not the only price rise in recent memory, granted, but coupled with the fact that these cards are already selling out everywhere, it sends a clear message to WotC: that they can keep raising your prices and we will keep digging deeper. This is not the message fans should want to send.</p>
<p>Worse still, you can’t simply ignore the set if you’re a competitive player because for the first time this is a Standard-legal set — <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">something Wizards of the Coast had previously said would not happen</a>. This means you have to get these cards if you want to play in any sanctioned format, but if you can’t get the cards because they’re either prohibitively expensive, or if they simply don’t exist, what are you supposed to do? Abandon your hobby?</p>
<p>It’s a difficult quandary. I love both Final Fantasy and Magic the Gathering, and seeing them come together like this is truly exciting. The thought of my hobby expanding to include more like-minded people is always great, and like everyone else I really can’t wait to get my hands on the product. The issue is that I simply can’t do that right now — my dreams of suiting up <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1081/darksteel-colossus-darksteel-colossus">Optimus Prime</a>&nbsp;with Cloud’s <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/255/buster-sword">Buster Sword</a> will have to wait for now.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive are masochists. There’s really no other explanation for the cruel, vehicular-based tortures that they continue to put gamers through. Where MudRunner had you driving through engulfing mud, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/snowrunner-review/">SnowRunner</a> made that slop colder, wetter and whiter, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions</a> stranded you in the wilderness, RoadCraft shifts the focus from getting your truck unstuck from the mud and more towards disaster relief.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YxFJTFi0Os?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Using a garage-full of diggers, cranes and dump trucks, you’re tasked with rebuilding and repairing the local infrastructure of various locations after nature has had its way with them. It’s a great fit for their realistic, slower-paced driving tech, and with a group of friends, this might just be the best entry in the series yet.</p>


<p>RoadCraft takes everything that Saber have created over the past decade years, and tailors it to the new construction-based format. That means that some elements from earlier games, like paying attention to the amount of fuel you have in your truck, have been left behind, while new, more specialised machinery has been added to the roster, each bringing unique control mechanics to wrestle with.</p>
<p>That makes RoadCraft more approachable than its forebears. Following the pitted path that the series has been on, there’s more of a focus on doing things, rather than just managing to make it from one place to another. That’s not to say that it’s not still a struggle. Mud remains your vehicles greatest enemy, sucking each wheel or tread into a mire and then making it very difficult to get back out, but the tried and tested solutions from the earlier games, like dropping your truck into low gear, locking the diff, or engaging all-wheel drive, are more effective here.</p>


<p>There also remains the ultimate hack: your winch. Each pickup truck – ostensibly for scouting, but capable of quite a bit more – can attach its winch to most things in the environment, from trees that can help drag you out of the mud through to concrete pipes that you need to get out of the road. It’s a constant lifesaver and you can often find a solution thanks to its multitude of applications.</p>
<p>Several tasks that were probably supposed to be done by a crane were instead achieved by my trusty little pickup dragging debris and industrial equipment around. Albeit, very, very slowly. If there’s one thing that playing Mudrunner games has taught me, it’s how to do things slowly.</p>
<p>The other lifesaver here is the ability to play RoadCraft with others. Up to four players can form a company and head out into each disaster zone, either trundling about ticking off separate objectives to speed through missions, or supporting each other, toiling away together on a multi-person project such as building a road.</p>
<p>One person begins with the dumper truck, carefully unloading a load of sand along the horrendously muddy track that must be made passable. This is then flattened by a bulldozer, its blade scraping the ground. Next, the asphalt-laying vehicle distributes its load across the street, followed by a roller that flattens it all in a slow and sensible manner. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a thrill ride, but RoadCraft manages to be both intense and ridiculously calming at the same time.</p>

<p>These big jobs don’t have to be onerous. In fact, you can choose to automate the procedure if you want, setting each vehicle off from the top-down map, watching them lay down the road from the safe distance of whatever satellite you’re supposed to be observing from. It’s certainly faster, and more precise, but you’re definitely missing out on some of the fun.</p>
<p>There is a narrative chain underpinning each mission, mostly delivered by your sassy handler, but it fundamentally boils down to ‘bad things have happened’. Your company’s response is to leap into action, ready and willing to repair whatever damage has been caused by the different disasters. Each mission sees you working your way through a series of objectives, leading to things not being in quite as bad a state as when you started. You can stay here, and continue to make everything neat and tidy, or you can choose to move on to the next mission.</p>
<p>It feels weird to say that a disaster zone looks good, but the development team have done a great job of making each environment look suitably battered and broken. Tattered trees and crumbling buildings certainly look realistic, but they also feel like real places, rather than some digital approximation of one.</p>

<p>The different vehicles, of which there are 40, are also detailed and suitably timeworn, and you’ll learn to love their different nuances. You can also customise your company vehicles, which is a nice touch to help differentiate each player’s pickup truck, and make it even more of a hoot when you hop in and steal their vehicle when yours is on the wrong side of the map.</p>
<p>Playing with others is made all the more enjoyable thanks to RoadCraft being the most accessible game in the series yet. You’ll still need rescuing from time to time, but the most onerous elements, like tyre pressures or keeping an eye on your fuel, have been done away with. It’s enough to shift the focus onto the task at hand, and playing with others is a consistent delight, turning each play session into being big kids with their digital dumper trucks. It’s been one of my favourite multiplayer experiences of the year, and I can see us regularly returning to it in the coming months.</p>
<p>The only real bumps in the road here are the camera and convoy AI. The camera is often unwieldy, refusing to quite give you the view you want of the action. It is manoeuvrable and you learn to live with it, but it just needs to be a few more increments further out, particularly when you’re using the crane. You also have to regularly set up supply routes for AI to follow between locations, but there’s no leeway or deviation from the route you draw on the world map, often leading to situations where the trucks have just gone a fraction off the safe route. Worse, they’ll just blare their horns at you if you ever happen to get in their way for even a second.</p>
