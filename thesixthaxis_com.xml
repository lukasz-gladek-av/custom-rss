		<p>Supergiant Games has announced that it has released its first major update for Hades II since the game launched properly. The list is very extensive covering things like the true ending, fixes to various items, and changes to a few encounters with other characters. Beware, if you have not yet played or completed Hades II then this is your SPOILER ALERT! Do not venture past the trailer if you do not want any surprised ruined. The rest of you, feel free to proceed.</p>

<ul>
<li>True Ending Enhancements: Added new events in the lead-up to the True Ending, and some after. As part of this, increased the number of Underworld clears required, and added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. Note: The vast majority of changes are to the Underworld route; the Surface route is mostly unchanged. The Epilogue is also unchanged</li>
<li>Returning to a Real Possibility: Added Cauldron incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story in case you wish to re-experience key events, such as the True Ending</li>
<li>Fated Prophecy Adjustments: A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before</li>
<li>Crossroads Renewal: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos compared to before. Any excess Kudos you have already spent will be refunded.</li>
