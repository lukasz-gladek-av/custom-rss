<p>Arma Reforger is set at the tail end of the Cold War in the year 1989, just a couple of years before the Soviet Union would dissolve. With the year in mind, all the military assets in game from vehicles to weapons are from that era. The game has also launched with four different modes for players to experience, taking them across Everon and Arland. Those modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conflict&nbsp;is a strategic battle for two islands whereby teams must capture specific points to gain an advantage over the enemy. Not only must they engage in combat with opposing factions, but they must build structures and run logistics to gain a defensible foothold on the island.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Game Master&nbsp;allows players to create custom scenarios with in-game assets to play solo or with friends. These can range from straightforward missions to elaborate scenarios, and the Game Master can modify the scenarios on the fly to curate a thrilling experience for players.</em></li>
<li><em>Combat Ops&nbsp;is a cooperative or single-player game mode where players must complete specific tasks and battle to extract from the islands of Everon and Arland. This cooperative game mode features dynamic objectives and enemy spawning, creating a unique experience for every match.</em></li>
<li><em>Capture &amp; Hold&nbsp;is a rapid-fire, high-pressure game mode that concentrates the immersive and realistic gameplay of Arma Reforger into short and intense matches.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Mod support is not available on the PS5 version of Arma Reforger, at least not yet. Bohemia Interactive is exploring this feature and is aiming to bring mod support in a future update.</p>
