		<p>Another week in the books, and it’s been one that’s raced by for me. Alas, we’ve not had Mafia: The Old Country through the doors for a review, but I’ve been able to sink a little time into Battlefield 6’s public beta now, made a little start on our review of the “brinepunk” roguelite Abyssus with Miguel, and repeatedly thrust my arms along a desk for something else.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> popped in to tell us that he’s been playing&nbsp;SkyCards and Wild Hearts. “SkyCards is a very addictive mix of card collecting and Top Trumps, but it is based on FlightTracker24 data so you catch planes in your area as they fly past. You can also travel to other airports, but to do that you have to unlock the airports, and the only way to do that is to catch a plane going there.”</p>
<p>This sounds… expensive.</p>


<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> spent this week playing DOOM: The Dark Ages and has been absolutely loving it, while Jim has been playing Far Cry 5, having waited for a console performance upgrade before making a start on it – “Ubisoft has a done a great job patching past-gen titles to give them a higher frame rate on PS5”. He’s enjoying its characters, setting and open world, with the only negative being that the combat hasn’t been all that dynamic, he feels.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to one another, <strong>Nic</strong> has been ill, and that is all, while <strong>Steve</strong> has been holidaying in North Wales. He took his Retroid Pocket 3+ with him and played a bit of Breath of Fire II on the journey. Aside from that, he’s been working his way through Wuchang, which he’s enjoying despite hitting a brick wall of a boss, and has finished the main campaign of Space Marine 2 with his online buddies, “which was a fun time but it did seem to take control away at the end for cutscenes rather than combat which was a bit disappointing.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Peglin for review, and blended that with a mix of&nbsp;Death Stranding, a bit of Animal Crossing, which he’s already growing tired of, Burnout Paradise, Saints Row 3, and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar for our upcoming review, and turned in a report on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/05/tanuki-pons-summer-brings-together-a-bmx-raccoon-package-delivery-and-sumo-wrestling/">Tanuki Pon’s Summer</a>.</p>
<p>And we’ll finish things out with an essay from <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing Mindseye! Is it as bad as all that?</p>
<p>“It’s really clear that this was meant to be a GTA style game, there’s a lot of set-up for the vibrant city, and there’s a lot of driving to locations, the maps are big. However, somewhere down the line, time and budget meant it got cut down to a series of linear missions and all the features you would expect don’t exist. For example, you can murder the staff at your new job by running them over and nothing happens, No police, no retribution, not even a smacked wrist. Guns just vanish when you pick them up for ammo, and while it looks nice, examine closer and you can spot the cut corners, in one mission the same stick could be found on the ground about every ten paces.”</p>

<p>“Almost two months after launch, and it’s still got acres of screen tearing, and when a new scene loads the whole screen flashes like a disco as objects load in. The plot doesn’t make any sense either, whacked-out ex-marine gets the top security job at the world’s biggest tech firm just because his mate asked? What? And then there’s the office of this revered figure that the new boss has deliberately kept undisturbed for years.. and yet anybody’s security card will open it and you can have a look around and mess with stuff. What? I can see the game they wanted to make. Sadly, they didn’t get remotely close to achieving it.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

			<p>For the longest time, I’ve associated Japanese developer MAGES with absolute anime nerd (weab) slop. Now, as a massive weab, I say that in the most endearing and well-meaning way. The dense sci-fi visual novel adventures of Steins;Gate&nbsp;and the schlocky, shocking horror of&nbsp;Corpse Party&nbsp;are some of my favorite games, but in the last year, I’ve come to appreciate MAGES for a series of games that their work on has seemed to be relatively unnoticed. The recent Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;remakes on Nintendo Switch were developed in part by MAGES, including the incredible new entry Emio – The Smiling Man.&nbsp;Delivering an incredibly mature, slow, ominous, and grounded visual novel detective mystery, it ended up as one of my favourite games of 2024. It’s no wonder I ended up loving Iwakura Aria, as it shares so much of that same DNA and style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Iwakura Aria | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSiPbhGA-AY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Iwakura Aria wastes no time delivering a drab and dour opening. In 1966, in the wake of the war, Japan is full of orphaned children with no reliable path forward. One such child is our protagonist, Ichiko Kitagawa, who clings to hope as she scrapes by and spends her time illustrating. One day, though, her art catches the eye of a mysterious man, who ends up being the head of the prestigious Iwakura household. Almost on sight, he invites her to join the household as a maid, giving her a home and a path forward, but for seemingly no clear reason or benefit to himself. The dominoes of uncertainty slowly tumble onward from there, as Ichiko gets familiar with the mansion, picks up on the secrets bubbling within it, and begins to bond with Aria, the heiress of the family.</p>



<p>The events of&nbsp;Iwakura Aria&nbsp;don’t immediately have a hostile or ominous air to them, but what makes that sense of dread creep through is the incredible aesthetic of the game. Every character is rendered in a gorgeous, detailed, painterly style that is reminiscent of&nbsp;The House of Fata Morgana.&nbsp;The backgrounds, though, are a bit sharper, a bit more realistic, and swathed with incredibly realistic shadows and lighting. The result is an unsettling tonal clash that kept me with a cold-sweat the entire time I was playing.</p>

<p>In an early scene, Ichiko uncovers a dark and dimly lit room that contains a wardrobe full of knives, hammers, and guns. The way household-head Amane Iwakura’s bright character art contrasts against the dark, foreboding room as he gaslights our protagonist into not worrying about the content of the wardrobe is incredible and sinister.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, Ichiko falls deeper and deeper into the hellish secrets of the Iwakura household. What I appreciated most about this game is that uncovering those secrets and seeing Ichiko’s story through to it’s bitter end doesn’t take long at all. The adventure wraps up in a dozen or so hours, which is light and brief compared to the gargantuan 40-80 hour runtimes of most other mystery VNs, including MAGES own Steins;Gate series. The brief runtime helps paper over some of Iwakura Aria’s weaker points, too – investigation gameplay is here, but often feels more arbitrary or forced than it does engaging or enticing. There’s also a surprising lack of expression variations for character sprites or unique illustrated CGs.</p>
<p>Still, those qualms are minor in the grand scheme of things. Iwakura Aria is an incredibly insightful, grim, and engaging visual novel that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The combination of dark subject matter and beautiful character art creates one of the most interesting visual novel experiences I’ve ever played, and is well worth checking out for anyone interested in a more grounded mystery VN experience.</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-party">LEGO Party</a>, the upcoming multiplayer party game, is building towards an official launch next month with the game slated to release on September 30th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Party! - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KPCZUY4s-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Announced earlier this year during the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/summer-games-fest">Summer Games Fest</a>, LEGO Party does exactly what it says on the tin. Developed by Aussie outfit, SMG Studio, and published by Fictions, this new licensed LEGO video game hurls four players into a vibrant, board game-like gauntlet where they must compete to earn the highest number of gold bricks.</p>
<p>Clearly, the developer (who also worked on the brilliant <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/moving-out">Moving Out</a> series) is looking to emulate some of Nintendo’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-party">Mario Party</a> magic. As players navigate the board in LEGO Party, they will land on spaces that transport them to one of 60 mini games.</p>
<p>What sets the game apart from main influence, of course, is its LEGO universe setting. Instead of leaning on crossover IPs such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, or Marvel, Party features scenes and characters from familiar themed sets including Space, Pirates, and Ninjago. One of the game’s main draws for LEGO fans will be collecting various character customisation components, with over a billion minifigure combinations.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game appeals to you, it’s been interesting to see the uptick in more experimental LEGO video games that don’t lean on popular franchises. For a good long while, developer Traveller’s Tales was dropping new LEGO games year after year, plumbing every Star Wars film, both the Marvel and DC comic book universes, and more. Always a hit with younger audiences, the overarching blueprint of these games was beginning to stale until 2022’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which evolved the formula with its open-world focus and free camera.</p>
<p>More recently, we’ve had games of all shapes and genres from LEGO 2K Drive and LEGO Bricktales to the upcoming LEGO Voyagers, complimenting Epic’s ongoing free-to-play LEGO Fortnite. Exactly where LEGO Party will ranked among these games is something we’ll be finding out very soon.</p>
