		<p>It’s bloody freezing out and about in the UK right now, so I hope you’re all keeping nice and toasty with some added layers, fashionable scarves and silly bobble hats, as needed. But despite the chill over here, the games industry in doing its stretches and warming up for the year. Things are going to start getting really interesting again in the next few weeks, after the slumber that always settles in over the end of year holidays.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been prepping for a house move, so gaming has been limited to just a smidgeon of Astro Bot, which was a Christmas present, and a bit of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm.</li>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong>, meanwhile has been having a blast of nostalgia with RoboCop: Rogue City. The slow movement works for combat, but less so when doing detective work, but it’s really having the authentic likenesses and actors from the original movies represented that does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>
