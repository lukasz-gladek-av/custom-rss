		<p>If you like the future Western aesthetic then Paradark Studios’ ExeKiller is one to keep an eye on. Described as a retro future Western, ExeKiller is set in a dystopian future where a catastrophic event has turned Earth into a scorched desert planet. But an apocalyptic event won’t get in the way of the darker side of human nature, meaning a bounty hunter is needed to find some criminals.</p>
<p><iframe title="ExeKiller - Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEeUzd4nAmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new gameplay overview, Paradark Studios shows different aspects of the world which you inhabit as Denzel Fenix, aka the bounty hunter known as ExeKiller. He works for the Helion company and as the story progresses revelations about the world and himself make Denzel a target for different factions. That means players have to be on the lookout for danger everywhere.</p>
<p>ExeKiller is set in a semi open world with one of the central locations being The Tower. Here Denzel can upgrade and purchase gear, gather information, and pick up some bounties to hunt. It is a generally safe area, a stark difference to the world outside. Denzel travels across the world in a car that has been designed to withstand things like severe weather and radiation, but you cannot avoid such dangers all of the time. Out of the car, Denzel has to be aware of both enemies and the environment which could turn to make things difficult. Players have full autonomy on how missions are resolved with no set linear paths. You can choose to go in all guns blazing, sneak around, talk your way through situations, or a mixture of all of these approaches. Whatever approach is chosen will impact how NPCs and factions react to Denzel, and the game’s ending. There is no XP to earn in the game with Denzel’s skills reliant on player skill and the mods and augments that are installed in Denzel.</p>

<p>A release date for ExeKiller has yet to be confirmed and so far it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>I’ve been ill. Wallowing in a horrible flu-ridden morass, and sleeping a hell of a lot. I have had some companions through this Lemsip-flavoured fog, though, and I’ve especially loved my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-review/">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. This is a football game that doesn’t feel like a football game, and it’s just a cracking JRPG that happens to feature kicking a ball. Besides that, I’ve been playing the demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and that’s just lovely, while I’ve been balancing things out with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontier of Pandora’s</a> bombastic newest expansion, From The Ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> was first up this week, and he’s played Ghost of Yotei, Borderlands 4, and also delved into Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, though he worries, “I’m trapped beneath countless open-world games!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been revisiting a couple of his favourites after wrapping up his playthrough Mafia: The Old Country (which was also a great game). He says, “For the first time in many months, I stepped back into the sandbox realm of Calradia for Mount &amp; Blade 2’s War Sails expansion. As the name implies, this DLC is all about naval gameplay, having also introduced a Viking-influenced faction. I’m learning the ropes of how to run my own ship while making lucrative trade runs between cities, hoping to save enough to buy a big ‘ol warship.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I’ve also been playing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide after picking up the post-launch character DLCs. The nimble, punk-styled Hive Scum is fun to play as though I’ve decided to main the Arbites class, channelling my inner Judge Dredd as I dole out justice beneath the Undercity.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit of Star Wars Outlaws, but most of his time has been split between Big Hops and MIO: Memories In Orbit for review.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> “thinks” he finished Hades 2 this week. That’s not due to some Roguelike dementia, but rather the difficulty level, saying, “There’s a few challenges remaining but they are well beyond my abilities. All in all, what an incredible game!” He also played ‘real-life’ games, telling us, “My son and I had an epic battle of Warhammer 40k down our local games shop. His Tyranids versus my Battle Sisters, pretty much everyone died after an epic battle, with us drawing on victory points. It was great fun and we’re booked in again for a rematch next week!”</p>

<p>And finally for this week, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun with skirting board in his free time, so hasn’t really carried on from his holiday Switch 2 gaming. And the thing that he has played? He can’t tell you about it until Monday.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you played any New Year games?</p>
