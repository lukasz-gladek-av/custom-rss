		<p>Virtual reality superbike sim VRider SBK is coming to PSVR 2 this week on the 27th June. This is an upgraded and enhanced version of the game already available on Meta Quest and Pico standalone platforms, and is also coming to to SteamVR sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="VRider SBK - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OASWt2XLsMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>VRiders SBK does what it says on the tin, translating superbike racing into VR, having your twist and tilt your hands and arms while embodying a racer. This is intended to be a ‘simcade’ experience, making the most of the Superbike World Championship license.</p>
<p>The game features 14 real-world tracks, now including Cremona and Estoril, and lets you race on five bikes from Ducati, BMW, Kawasaki, Honda, and Yamaha. In addition to a solo Tournament mode and Ghost races against the clock.</p>
<p>With the PSVR 2 version of the game compared to the standalone headset game, Funny Tales has been able to improve the bike modelling, animate the skybox, feature more realistic tarmac, animated crowds, greater trackside detail and more. Additionally, there can be up to 22 AI racers on track in single-player.</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic has announced their 2025 Digital Showcase will take place on 1st August, featuring a bunch of the games that will be featured, and potentially teasing more about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">the upcoming Darksiders project</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Included in the trailer were clips of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/reanimal-revealed-by-the-makers-of-little-nightmares-tarsier/">Reanimal</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/wreckreations-new-trailer-is-all-about-building-tracks-racing-together/">Wreckreation</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/wreckfest-2-content-update-1-brings-tracks-cars-patch-notes/">Wreckfest 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/see-the-first-gameplay-trailer-for-titan-quest-2/">Titan Quest II</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/the-eternal-life-of-goldman-is-a-platformer-with-a-wonderful-ligne-claire-art-style/">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">Gothic’s remake</a>, and maybe one or two more that I missed.</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn’t seem that Darksiders is included in the trailer itself – the dark fantasy imagery would be more Titan Quest II – but they do tell everyone to “saddle your horses” in the trailer blurb. You know who rides horses? The four horsemen, of course.</p>
<p>“This year’s showcase promises a feast of world premiere announcements, fresh updates on previously announced titles, and a few surprises we didn’t hint at already… or did we?” the company writes.</p>

<p>The stream will kick off<span dir="auto"> Friday 1st August 1st &nbsp;at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / </span><span dir="auto">21:00</span><span dir="auto"> CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</span></p>
