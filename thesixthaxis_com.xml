		<p><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">Whats-on-netflix.com</a> is reporting that an animated series based on everyone’s favourite marsupial is being worked on for Netflix. The studio behind the Sonic Prime animated series, WildBrain Studios, is said to be working on the show.</p>
<p>Amazon had previously announced a Crash Bandicoot series, but that was cancelled without reason in 2021. However, test animations from the series have appeared and you can watch them below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Cartoon - Scene Pitch Old vs. New" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/orXw6JpEK1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is no other information on the new series but it does seem a peculiar option, as popular as Crash was he’s not exactly an A-lister in 2025. There again Hollywood is trying to make a film based on Sleeping Dogs which had one game back in 2012.</p>
<p>Toys For Bob, who were behind the remakes of Crash 1-3 and the new game, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, split from<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/"> Activision in March 2024</a> and were rumoured to be working on a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/a-new-spyro-game-reportedly-in-development-at-toys-for-bob/">new Spyro game.&nbsp;</a>However, Microsoft – who now own Activision – have been making sweeping cuts to both their upcoming projects and<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/"> their staff, </a>&nbsp;concentrating on their big hitters such as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The Toys for Bob website still shows they are working on a game but it has not been updated since 2024 so the fate of Spyro seems unclear. A sequel to Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time was rumoured to be in development at Toys for Bob but was allegedly cancelled when the sales for Crash 4 were underwhelming.</p>
<p>We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">7/10 in our review</a>. “Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time really is the definitive Crash game,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">said Steve</a>. “Toys For Bob have taken all the series’ trademarks, refined them into a challenging and polished experience and given us tons of levels to play and secrets to hunt for. There’s new characters to play as and masks that shake up the gameplay when they appear, but Crash 4 is the same old Bandicoot who’s learnt a few new tricks.”</p>

		<p>Many years ago, in the last century in fact, there were rumours that Hideo Kojima was in talks to create a video game based on the blockbuster film The Matrix.&nbsp; That never came to pass and Shiny Entertainment took the license and released two games which were cannon within the Matrix universe. They were Enter the Matrix and The Path of Neo, and both were rather good, I remember spending most of one Christmas playing Enter The Matrix.</p>
<p>A new interview with Christopher Bergstresser, a former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, has revealed that “the Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima” and met with him along with Aki Saito and Kasumi Kitaue, an executive at Konami.</p>


<p>“The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that’?” recalls Christopher. “Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’.”</p>
<p>It seems that Kojima continued to be interested in the idea, but it never came to pass, probably as Konami had him busy with Metal Gear Solid 2 at the time.</p>
<p>Kojima continued to correspond with the Wachowskis and in 2000 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">met with them</a> to discuss the similarities between their works.&nbsp; “I have seen (The Matrix) four times. I like this type of work. What I was planning to do in my next project, they pretty much made into a motion picture. We were planning on certain things like characters running on walls and such, but they’ve beat me to it (laughs).”</p>

<p>Later, Kojima’s hit Death Stranding explored similar themes as The Matrix franchise, such as the blurring of reality and another world, while the character Higgs has similarities to Agent Smith.</p>
<p>However, this might not be the end of the story. Kojima is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">working on OD for Microsoft</a>, and we now know that is going to be an anthology horror game with a famous directors taking on an episode. The only confirmed name is Jordan Peele, but the Wachowskis would be an excellent choice for an episode.</p>
