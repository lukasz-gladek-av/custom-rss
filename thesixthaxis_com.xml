		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-patch-notes-crash-bug-fixes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> patch, with hotfix 1.1.2 targeting a clutch of crash bugs so the game won’t keel over when “looking at certain locked doors”, “interacting with a cart” or when “spamming keys on the EULA screen”.</p>
<p>I think spamming keys at the EULA is pretty much universal gamer behaviour, because who’s got time in their finite lives to actually read that legalese gibberish? But once you actually get into the game, looking at doors of all kinds and interacting with carts are both pretty integral to the immersive medieval experience that KCD2 provides.</p>


<p>I’m poking a little bit of fun, of course, and it’s always good to see developers stamping out the odd little bugs and crashes that inevitably remain in games after release. Warhorse has plenty plans for more support with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions/">three major questline expansions coming through the rest of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched at the start of February to plenty of praise from critics – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our KCD2 review here</a> – and players alike, continuing down the immersive RPG style of the original. The game has already turned a profit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/542223437984170029">on its way to 2 million sales</a>, and the positive word of mouth could see that number keep on climbing, even in an absolutely stacked start to the year with big game releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the KCD2 Hotfix 1.1.2 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>Fortuna&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bozhena and Pavlena will no longer report the player for crimes during the quest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The King’s Gambit&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quest interactor for wine will no longer disappear, allowing players to continue pouring wine for the guests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the crossbow aiming zoom on ultrawide resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform-specific fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epic Games Store: Fixed the issue with achievements not being completed after longer than one hour of play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the issue with rewards sometimes requiring game restart to be awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when looking at certain locked doors and chests.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash sometimes occurring loading the game after finishing the dice mini-game.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to opening the horse inventory.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to interacting with a cart.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when spamming keys on the EULA screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when having conflicting versions of the Bink library.</li>
<li>A few dozen additional stability fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Update 3 adds better path tracing on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-better-path-tracing-on-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-better-path-tracing-on-pc.1115214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-better-path-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> Update 3 has been released, and while there’s a huge swathe of bug fixes made throughout the game, the new features are all focussed on PC hardware support, improved path tracing, and broader availability of path tracing in the game.</p>
<p>With the recent releases of Nvidia’s GeForce 50 series cards and DLSS 4, this has now been integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, introducing the new transformer-based model for upscaling and ray-reconstruction, and up to 4x multi-frame generation. For AMD and Intel, AMD FSR 3.1 (with frame gen) is now integrated, and so is Intel XESS 1.4.</p>


<p>The game relies on certain ray-tracing effects for lighting and ambient occlusion across the board, but up until now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">the path tracing option</a> (described as ‘Full Ray Tracing’) has been limited to Nvidia GPUs that are more capable of getting playable performance out of it. MachineGames has now loosened the reigns on this, so AMD and Intel GPU owners can enable path tracing and enjoy what some might call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/09/assassins-creed-unity-devs-say-30fps-is-more-cinematic-and-feels-better/">more cinematic performance</a>…</p>
<p>Could this hint at a path tracing mode for the PS5 release of the game that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">expected this spring</a>, taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>? Probably not, but if it happens, I’m going to say “I told you so!”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (beware of spoilers through the bug fixes, though).</p>

<h2>NEW FEATURES</h2>
<h3>NVIDIA DLSS 4</h3>
<p>Update 3 brings support for NVIDIA DLSS 4: a suite of rendering technologies that boosts framerates, increases performance, and improves image quality! – Players using supported NVIDIA hardware can enable Multi Frame Generation (3x, 4x) using the new transformer-based model – Ray Reconstruction increases the clarity and stability of ray-traced images – DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution have also been updated to the transformer-based model. These options when enabled enhance native and upscaled image quality, respectively</p>
<h3>Ray-Traced Local Lights</h3>
<p>For players who have Path Tracing enabled, this update includes a new option for ray-traced shadows to include all light sources, which significantly increases the quality of shadows in interior locations. (Players can also choose to keep the previous setting, which provides ray-traced shadows from the sun only.)</p>
<h3>Path Tracing (Full Ray Tracing) Support for AMD and Intel Graphics Cards</h3>
<p>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer! Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</p>
<h3>FSR 3.1, including Frame Generation</h3>
<p>Update 3 adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology.</p>
<h3>Intel XESS 1.4</h3>
<p>Update 3 also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<h3>Quality of Life Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repair kits can now also be used by selecting them directly from the inventory (Rather than only by selecting your broken weapon or tool!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>BUG FIXES — MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where players could not unlock the “Shadows out of Time” achievement if they had any Ancient Relics placed in the Puzzle Boards in Iraq. (I.e. if you did not have all 50 Relics in your inventory.) For players who have already completed the puzzle, simply revisiting Iraq will now unlock the achievement</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where collecting the last ancient relic for “Riddles of the Ancients” did not update the counter in the UI, giving the impression there was still another to collect. Also fixed issues where this mission had no description on your map information, and certain Ancient Relic markers did not appear on the Sukhothai and Vatican maps</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where taking photos of the monkey posters in Sukhothai did not remove their in-world markers</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the cogwheel markers might not appear if players purchased the map information pamphlet after a certain point in Sukhothai</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the main Sukhothai main map could be lost if you put it down after inspecting it (instead of collecting it)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would not leave Wat Si Sawai if you left the temple while she was talking with Aran</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent the desk drawer being opened in the poker tent in Gizeh</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Gina could open the cavern door in Iraq by herself, leading to the cavern being empty of all enemies</li>
<li>Added additional voice lines to help the player understand that they should run away from the Nephilim in the dream sequence in Sukhothai, rather than fight</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could not pick up the Priest outfit from Antonio if they tried to do it too quickly</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would repeat her lines from the ambush (“That was too close”) while you are in the boat. Please note this will, unfortunately, not correct the issue for players who are currently experiencing the bug, but it will prevent it from happening again</li>
<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>
<li>Raised the volume of the enemy mounted machineguns in Sukhothai hotel shootout</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/among-us-3d-is-among-us-vr-without-the-vr-steam-next-fest-demo-incoming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Innersloth and Schell Games have revealed an un-VR-ified version of Among Us VR. Among Us 3D is coming to PC via Steam with a Steam Next Fest demo coming next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Us 3D ???? Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the fullness of time, Among Us 3D will be a flatscreen counterpart to Among Us VR, coming with cross-play between the two 3D adaptations of the hit social deduction game. In turn, it is very much like the original 2D Among Us… but in three dimensions. The game can be played with 4-10 players, all running around completing tasks on the map until a murdered body is discovered, calling an Emergency Meeting to try and determine who the imposter is, and eject the into space. Of course, playing either in VR or 3D makes this all much closer and more personal…</p>
<p>The Steam Next Fest demo is more limited than the full Among Us 3D release will be, and will not support all features or game modes. So there’s no crossplay or additional cosmetics, until the full release comes down the pipe.</p>
<p>Here’s the feature breakdown from the Steam listing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Native Proximity Voice Chat</strong> — Yap with your friends directly in-game. No need for additional third-party platforms!</li>
<li><strong>New and Returning Minigames</strong> —&nbsp; Experience the tasks you know and love, along with some new ones. Now, with first-person controls.</li>
<li><strong>Crossplay Functionality —</strong> Join lobbies with other VR<i> </i>players! (<i>Note: <strong>The game is NOT compatible with the original </strong></i><strong>Among Us <i>game</i></strong><i>. Sorry, beans.</i>)</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Beansona </strong>— Expand your wardrobe of hats, gloves, and skins with an endless number of cosmetic customization combinations!</li>
</ul>
<p>After Among Us became one of the breakout hits of 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/among-us-is-getting-vr/">Innersloth partnered with Schell Games to produce Among Us VR</a>, launching in 2022. It’s a great fit conceptually for VR, adding more tactile minigames, the isolation of running around doing tasks, while trying to be aware of your surroundings and spot suspicious behaviour. But VR games have often been adapted back to flatscreen, and now it’s Among Us’ turn to make that return trip. The 2D original game will surely remain the most popular version of Among Us, but a 3D counterpart is sure to pick up an audience of its own, especially with VR cross-play.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings">A Lord of the Rings</a> game has been delayed again, being pushed back from March to a new 29th July 2025 release date. The cosy Hobbit life sim is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Netflix gaming.</p>
<p>Weta Workshop announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-of-the-shire">Tales of the Shire</a> delay on a place we ain’t linking to these days:</p>


<p>Dear Fellow Hobbits,</p>
<p>A good Hobbit feast takes time, and so does <a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> the Shire! We’re taking a little longer to ensure that every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cozy experience. The game will now launch on July 29, 2025.</p>
<p>We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth, and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you’ll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right.</p>

<p>We appreciate your patience and cannot wait for you to experience life in The Shire this summer. In the meantime, arrange the table, polish your silver and get ready for a feast fit for a Hobbit!</p>
<p>Looking forward to welcoming you to Bywater.</p>
<p>—From the folks at Weta Workshop Game Studio</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/tales-of-the-shire-is-a-cosy-life-sim-set-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-universe/">announced</a> and expected to launch in 2024, Tales of the Shire has now had multiple delays. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">A rough 2025 window</a> was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">narrowed to March 2025</a>, but clearly Weta need more time to realise this cosy take on fantasy world.</p>
