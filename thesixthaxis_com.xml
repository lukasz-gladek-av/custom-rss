		<p>The first Mortal Kombat games are being gathered together in to one pack with over 20 versions of the titles.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection includes Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, Mortal Kombat IV, and Mortal Kombat Advance., with variations of the games including the original arcade titles as well as home versions such as the the Nintendo Gameboy game. Each game will include “modern enhancements” and online play using rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You will also be able to unlock and play all of the secret modes and characters from the games. “We will give you open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization. How will we do that? Uh… that’s still a secret. But it won’t be for long. We’ll have much more to say about Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection later this year,” say Digital Eclipse.</p>
<p>There will also be an interactive documentary packed with rare concept art, archival footage, and brand-new interviews. Earlier this year, Digital Eclipse travelled to NetherRealm Studios to interview Mortal Kombat co-creators Ed Boon and John Tobias alongside literally dozens of other developers, actors, industry luminaries, fans, and Mortal Kombat experts.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the playable games announced so far – with more on the way.</p>

		<p>IO Interactive dropped an announcement trailer for 007 First Light, a new origin story for the iconic spy that is set to launch in 2026. A full gameplay reveal is set for later this summer, with the game in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fgtpwEMPM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is James Bond’s first mission for the British Secret Service, an up and coming operative with a reckless streak that M sees a little potential with. 009 seems to have gone rogue, and Bond will have to earn his 00 status</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of a James Bond story, such as just announcing who he is, getting a bit flirty with the ladies, playing with gadgets that Q has cooked up, and some classic car chases while jet-setting around the globe.</p>
<p>There’s snippets of gameplay-like action. An environment scan, tagging guards with a gadget, takedowns and a bit of brawling and gunplay. Much of the trailer is cinematics and story, mind you, so we’ll have to wait for some gameplay deep dives to see how it all comes together.</p>

<p>At the very least, it’s a much more suave, action-packed looking take on the covert assassinations that IO Interactive made their own with the Hitman series. The movement looks slicker, there’s almost certainly cars and other vehicles, and it will be interesting to see how IO strikes the balance between open and linear sections to join up their story.</p>
<p>Might as well look back on their last game then, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 launching in 2021</a>. We said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>
