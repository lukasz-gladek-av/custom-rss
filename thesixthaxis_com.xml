<p>In our review, Adrian said, <em>“Ninja Gaiden 2 Black offers a comprehensive remake of Team Ninja’s finest game, rendered in beautiful modern visuals. Combat is as bombastically brilliant as it ever was, though the awful camera will put off many of those new to the game, it really hasn’t aged well. Still, as a reminder of how good Ninja Gaiden can be, this remake offers a tantalising taste of what we can all look forward to when Ninja Gaiden 4 is released later this year.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/crysis-4-development-put-on-hold-as-crytek-confirm-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Crytek has confirmed a round of layoffs that will affect around 15% of its 400 employees – so around 60 people from the team – and stated that development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis-4">the next Crysis game</a> was put on hold last year.</p>
<p>“Like so many of our peers, we aren’t immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years,” the company wrote on social media.</p>


<p>“It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams.”</p>
<p>A new Crysis game was in development, but put on hold in Q3 of 2024, with Crytek prioritising the work on their extraction game revamp <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown-1896">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/crysis-4-crytek-china-crysis-battleground/">Crysis 4 was announced back in 2022</a> with a short teaser trailer, the company looking to revive the first person shooter series on the heels of the Crysis trilogy remasters that arrived through 2020 and 2021. However, Crytek was also enjoying some success within the burgeoning extraction shooter genre with Hunt: Showdown, an occult and monster-infused take on the genre.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/hunt-showdown-1896-will-replace-the-original-in-august-sunsetting-ps4-and-xbox-one/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been a big reboot and sequel to that game</a>, bringing a new generation of Cry Engine to bear on the game (shutting the original down in the process), as well as overhauling the game’s core content. It didn’t strike true for us in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 review</a>, but has been a solid evolution for the company.</p>
<p>They continue, “While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.”</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to those affected by these layoffs, and hopefully they can find their feet again soon.</p>
