		<p>The rugger’s back again this weekend for all us seasonal fans that basically just turn up for the Six Nations. There’s a potential title decider starting things off, a two-sided redemption quest up in Scotland, and we’ll see if Italy can break their one remaining duck in the competition tomorrow.</p>
<p>But we’re here for the gaming news and headlines of the week, and Nacon Connect gave us a good few game announcements.</p>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive left it until pretty much the last minute, but has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> has been delayed until later in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">Previously expected for launch on 25th March</a>, Killing Floor 3’s delay does not have a new release date. While still expected to arrive in 2025, anyone who pre-ordered the game will automatically receive refunds on Epic, Xbox and PS5, while US-based PS5 pre-orders will be prompted to choose and Steam pre-orders are free to cancel manually. <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/">See here for more details</a>.</p>


<p>“After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we’ve realized that we missed the mark,” the team explained on a certain social media cesspool. “Our goal isn’t just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you’ve come to know and love.</p>
<p>“With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we’re working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it’s too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.</p>
<p>“We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we’re ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.”</p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a narrative wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves. The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>

<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the recent Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying “Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</p>
