		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that its wheel chair basketball game Drag x Drive will release on August 14th for the Switch 2. The game will be a digital exclusive through the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop, ruling out a physical release for the game. It can be pre-ordered for £16.99 right now by following this link; <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=DragxDrive%7CNULL%7CReleaseDateAN%7Cm_id_7ab52249f6%7C2785803">Drag x Drive | Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>.</p>

<p>Drag x Drive is a 3v3 multiplayer wheelchair basketball game, with players needing to use the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons’ mouse mode optical sensors along with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score. to really get the full experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/can-drag-x-drive-be-the-arms-of-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Can Drag x Drive be the ARMS of the Nintendo Switch 2?</a></p>

<p>In our Drag x Drive preview, Stefan said, <em>“The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see. Secondly, it’s all just a bit drab…With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could –&nbsp;could – be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.”</em></p>

		<p>Bloomberg is reporting that Microsoft is planning to layoff a significant number of people in the Xbox division next week, with the company restructuring the organisation. This seems to be separate from the announcement of last month when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/">Microsoft announced it was laying off 3% of all employees affecting thousands of jobs</a>.</p>
<p>This new round of layoffs is not supposed to be public knowledge according to Bloomberg, so the scale of these layoffs is not yet known. We do not know if it will lead to studios being shuttered or if it will be other roles in the division that will be affected. Microsoft has not shied away from making cuts with this being the fourth round of such cuts within 18 months. The last time the gaming side was hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks were closed by Microsoft.</a></p>


<p>Microsoft’s market value is currently at $3.646 trillion.</p>

		<p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it will be delaying the console release of System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, and that it will not be released on June 26th.

<p>In a statement, Nightdive Studios said, <em>“We have encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles including Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation on June 26. We’re currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible. Because of this we’ve made the difficult decision to proceed with the game’s release on PC platforms (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble) on June 26, with the console release now targeting the first two weeks of July. We’ll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles.”</em></p>
