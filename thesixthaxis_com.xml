		<p>Lost Soul Aside has re-emerged after quite the silence, and there is a new trailer confirming that the game will be out in 2025 for PS5 and PC. Lost Soul Aside first appeared on the radar back in 2016 for PS4, and was originally set to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/24/lost-soul-aside-becomes-timed-exclusive-on-ps4/">coming out in 2018</a>. The last we heard of the game was in 2021, when it was confirmed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/lost-soul-aside-final-fantasy-style-game-ps5/">Lost Soul Aside would be getting a PS5 release</a>.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside has been inspired by the Final Fantasy series as well as other RPGs and action games, with the story centred around the hero trying to save his sister, and all of humankind, in a world that is being invaded by forces from another dimension. It is a single player action-adventure RPG with fast paced combat using weapons and abilities, which will come in handy against the world of interdimensional invaders and bosses.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is a project from &nbsp;solo developer Bing Yang, who has been building up Lost Soul Aside which would explain why it has taken so long to come close to release.</p>
