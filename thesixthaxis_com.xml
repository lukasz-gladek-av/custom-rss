		<p>Hangar 13 and 2K have announced that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8th for PS5, PC, Xbox Series XS, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now. To mark this news, a new gameplay trailer for Mafia: The Old Country has been released, and it shows shootouts, stealth attacks, car chases, and horseback chases with more shootouts thrown in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTmJDf6CuZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar&nbsp;<em>Mafia</em>&nbsp;gameplay,” said Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes. “That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi’s crime family.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mafia games that were set in the US, Mafia: The Old Country takes us to the very beginning of the Mafia and its base in Sicily. Enzo Favara is a brand new protagonist in the series and with the time setting, we will not see any of the characters from previous titles as most of them haven’t been born yet. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Hanger 13 has also released some developer insights that you can watch too. This video focuses on how the studio created the setting for the story of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
