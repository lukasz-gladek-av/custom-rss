<p>The Arsenal’s in Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion can equipped up to six pieces of equipment including a shoulder mounted weapon, an auxiliary, a left weapon, a right weapon, and two side weapons. The weapon types are medium range rifles, blades for close quarter combat, bazookas for long range attacks that can do high damage, bows that can target weak points, and for groups of enemies you can use missiles and railguns. Auxiliary’s are used as support items to help in battle, and the gameplay has been designed to allow switching between weapons with ease.</p>
<p>Before engaging in a battle, players can scan enemies to find their weaknesses. For example, enemies that have have a hard exterior are more susceptible to laser damage while soft exterior enemies have a weakness to physical weapons. When in combat, players can use knockdown and grab attacks to tear off armour to expose weak areas.</p>

<p>In our Daemon X Machina review, Miguel said,<em> “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</em></p>

<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is going to be release on September 5th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>
