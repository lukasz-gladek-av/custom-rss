		<p>The Walking Dead is coming back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> in a new and creative way, with a bunch of assets and content from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead Universe</a> added to Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative. This means you’ll be able to drop into the editing tools and quickly cook up a Zombie-filled TWD-themed island of your own.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Walking Dead Universe Lurches into UEFN and Fortnite Creative" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sB3hyiahKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different elements that you’ll be able to draw upon for your creations. It starts with the Walker NPC template for UEFN, a slow and shambling enemy that just wants to chomp on people, giving damage-over-time and eventual death. They can be grouped into hordes and can also smash through breakable environmental props.</p>
<p>This collaboration will also add Negan to Fortnite, both as a playable character for purchase from 4th April, and as an NPC with an update on 8th April. The Shiva Shotgun and Negan’s iconic spiked bat, Lucille, are also available.</p>

<p>But you don’t want to just drop these into basic Fortnite levels. The Prison Starter Island Template gives a basic prison layout to then populate and customise, and there’s also eight prison-themed Prefabs that can be placed in worlds. It can all be made to look extra TWD-like with a Heavy Linework shader to get that graphic novel feel.</p>
<p>Alongside all the other tools available in UEFN, you can create whatever kind of experience you want with this. Epic suggest survival RPGs, prison escapes and FFA shoot ’em ups, but I reckon a zombie baseball game would be a good shout.</p>
<p>Any creations can be published from 16th May via the Creator Portal, and can then potentially be found in the TWDU section of Discover, which will be present for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/the-walking-dead-universe-lurches-into-uefn-and-fortnite-creative?team=personal">Head to the announcement blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In other Fortnite-ly news, people that want to relive the early days of Fortnite BR can continue to do so with Fortnite OG, which has now moved on to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-makes-a-lucky-landing-into-season-3">Chapter 1 Season 3</a>. This brings back Lucky Landing and features a meteor on a collision course with the original island.</p>

<p>A bit like rewatching a favourite TV show, we all know what happens next, but it’s nice to revisit, isn’t it? The huge Team Deathmath mode OG 50v50 is also coming back for a limited time, so get into that while you can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AI Limit Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/ai-limit-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-limit-review.1145016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/ai-limit-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>AI Limit is, strangely enough, a game that’s all about mud. Your player character, Arrisa, is formed from mud. When you die – which you will a lot – Arrisa is respawned from mud. Most foes you encounter are made from mud, heck, you can even eat mud balls to regain health. Also, when you meander down the umpteenth dingey dull brown subterranean tunnel as you make your way through a level, you’ll be thinking the environment looks darn muddy too. AI Limit’s predilection with the goopy brown stuff is a little bit odd…</p>
<p><iframe title="AI Limit - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9AckdXyWGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s not the only odd thing about AI Limit, as the story is, quite frankly, bonkers. An assembly of random proper nouns haphazardly glued together – probably with mud – proceedings are overly complicated, make little sense, and are likely best ignored. Suffice to say, Arrisa is an immortal Blader, tasked with traversing a post-apocalyptic landscape to protect the last city of Havenswell. She’ll do this by slaying numerous beasties in a third person action adventure Soulslike.</p>
<p>Unlike a Souls game however, the levels here are almost completely linear. There are some shortcuts to be found, but you’ll generally be traipsing through the exact same level, along the exact same route, again and again. What is initially fun soon becomes a chore, as the identical hidden cultist ambushes you as they always tediously too, like some confused inhabitant of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Finally, you’ll open a shortcut and get to avoid the hidden cultist, but AI Limit will push your patience in the wait to do so.</p>


<p>Combat is decent if unremarkable, a selection of light and chargeable hard attacks are available, though light attacks are much more effective, so you’re unlikely to do much charging. Rapid and capable of staggering most foes, light attacks prove so potent that hammering their button proves a more winning strategy than all the dodging, parrying, and special abilities combined. Particularly when the controls are a little bit off, as they are here. Inputs are regularly laggy and the targeting fussy, often leading to death as Arrisa insists on not looking at the demon about to kill her.</p>
<p>The Sync Rate mechanic is a neat addition, though. The more you hit opponents the more powerful your attacks become, but being hit or using abilities lowers your Sync Rate and thus your attack power. The risk and reward balance is intriguing but poorly implemented and under-explored; when light attacks are by far your best option and can quickly boost your Sync Rate, why bother troubling yourself doing anything else? As a result, combat is perfunctory and soon becomes rather dull, a significant issue when hitting stuff forms the majority of the game.</p>

<p>Boss encounters are fine, with some memorable behemoths to take down, but they are resolutely cheap in their tactics. Relying on insta-kill attacks to make the game difficult, rather than increasingly dangerous and varied attack patterns to fend off before finding your opening to strike back. Again, decide to stick with it, hammer light attack and force Arrisa to look in the right direction, and you’ll eventually defeat the boss, I’m just not sure how much fun you’ll be having in the process.</p>
<p>Visually, despite the dull as dish-water environments, the characters and enemies are well-designed and fluidly animated, with a lovely anime aesthetic that serves to make the game look more interesting. But don’t be fooled; this is a paint-by-numbers Soulslike offering little of note to differentiate it from the multitude of other games in the genre.</p>

		<p>While big blockbuster games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and Call of Duty pull in huge audience numbers, there are games that quietly ramp up the player numbers without entering the global consciousness. That’s definitely the case for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046300/Pirates_Outlaws/">Pirates Outlaws</a>, a game which racked up an astounding 3 million downloads, while accruing over 30,000 positive reviews on Android.
