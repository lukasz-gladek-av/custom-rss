		<p>The Binding of Isaac has received a new free DLC today, called Repentance+, that adds online multiplayer to the game. The new update allows up to four players to play together and run through the game. However, to run the new Repentance+ DLC, all players will require all of the previously released DLC for The Binding of Isaac for it to work, and mods are not compatible with the online side of the game. While Nicalis is calling this a beta, it has been confirmed this DLC is feature complete.</p>

<p>In The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ players can play on Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier and do Challenges. There are also Daily Runs that will provide different challenges for players to tackle too. Achievements can be unlocked online, but only if you are present from the start of a run. Joining partway through a run will not count towards unlocking any achievements. Online play has some differences from solo play, including defeated bosses dropping loot for each player. Those who join a run partway through will be given items so they are not at a disadvantage compared to players who were present from the beginning. If a player dies, the rest of the team can choose to revive a player at a revive machine on each floor, though the cost of revival goes up every time a machine is used. Alternatively, the remaining players can try and defeat bosses without their fallen teammates as being successful also revives teammates. The full changelog can be seen below.</p>

<p>Item Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tammy’s Head – Reduced the duration of the animation when using Tammy’s Head, allowing Isaac to fire more quickly after use.</li>
<li>Lemon Mishap – Slightly increased the size of the puddle. Also, the puddle will now persist until Isaac exits the room.</li>
<li>Mega Bean – Creates a catastrophic fart that sweeps the entire room.</li>
<li>Milk! – The familiar now follows closely behind Isaac and blocks shots. After 10 hits, the glass will break and give Isaac a Tears upgrade for the remainder of the floor.</li>
<li>Delirious – Summoned bosses will now persist through rooms. Only one boss can be active at a time. The charge is now variable, based on the quality of the previously summoned boss.</li>
<li>Jar of Wisps – Reduced to a 6-room charge, allowing the wisps to stack up to the maximum number more quickly.</li>
<li>Abyss – Item quality now impacts the damage of the summoned locust. Locusts now inherit many different effects based on the item destroyed by Abyss.</li>
<li>Flip – Charge has been reduced to 4 rooms for Tainted Lazarus only.</li>
<li>Portable Slot – Removed from the Shop pool. Added as a possible reward from slot machines.</li>
<li>Void – Charge has been reduced from 6 rooms to 4.</li>
<li>Epiphora – The Tears upgrade from firing in a single direction is now a smooth increase, instead of being staggered every few seconds.</li>
<li>God’s Flesh – Doubled the chance of shrink tears firing. Shrunken enemies now briefly flash white before growing back to full size. Enemies that explode, fire shots or summon minions on death can no longer hurt Isaac if they’re killed while shrunken.</li>
<li>Hushy – While held in place, Hushy now fires radial bursts of shots.</li>
<li>It Hurts – After taking damage, Isaac’s tears will now leave behind small pools of blood creep for the room.</li>
<li>Mars – In addition to being invulnerable when charging, Isaac will gain a 1-second bubble of invulnerability after the charge. Hitting obstacles also causes a knockback effect to clear any threats from the surrounding area.</li>
<li>Evil Charm – Isaac now gains immunity to spider-web slowdown, flame attacks, fireplaces and poison mushrooms. Isaac can also stand in enemy creep for 1 second before taking damage.</li>
<li>Vasculitis – Friendly radial shots fired after killing an enemy will now appear as blood clots to more easily distinguish them.</li>
<li>Lil’ Portal – Has been completely reworked. Double-tapping a fire button is now required to launch Lil’ Portal. After it has consumed enough items and the room is clear, a single portal will spawn and the familiar will now disappear for the remainder of the floor. Entering this portal now takes Isaac to a room where he can pick up or drop off items. This room persists throughout the rest of the current run.</li>
<li>Linger Bean – The fart cloud is now deployed after 4 seconds of continuous fire (instead of 7 seconds). The cloud starts small and potent, and will grow and deal reduced damage over the course of 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Jupiter – Now heals 2 red hearts instead of just ½.</li>
<li>Butter Bean – Recharge time has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2.</li>
<li>The Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Kidney Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Dead Bird – Will remain active between rooms as long as the player is at ½ heart. (Note: Eve requires 1 full heart.)</li>
<li>Data Miner – Using Data Miner in a room with an item pedestal will now reroll it into a glitched item.</li>
