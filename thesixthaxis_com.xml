		<p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is here, and it brings another big batch of free content, including a new PvE Operation and a new Tyranid boss, the Trygon which lends the update its name. There’s also plenty of new PvP content, season pass additions and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Trygon Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oAHVCnAXxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new PvE Operation, Extraction, tasks you with reaching the Adeptus Mechanicus facility on Avarax, figuring out where the Tech-Priest is that is refusing to extract, and try to get them out of there, if they’ve survived so far. Along the ay you’ll face off against the Trygon, a huge burrowing Tyranid that creates underground passageways for other Tyranid to us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you can now earn Prestige Ranks in PvE – visit the Armouring Hall once you’ve reached level 25 and activate prestiging from the Skill Tree screen – there’s private PvP lobbies, a new Inferno Pistol secondary, new customisation options, and updates to the weapons, weapon perks, matchmaking and a bunch of other bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>For Season Pass holders, there’s the new Space Wolves Chapter Pack and Imperial Fists Champion Pack to let you customise your look in even more ways.</p>

<p>See all of those in the full patch notes:</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p><b>New Operation — Exfiltration</b></p>
<p><i>Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that&nbsp; creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms.</i></p>
<p><b>Private Lobbies in PvP</b></p>
<p><i>A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes.</i></p>
<p><b>Prestige Ranks in PvE</b></p>
<p><i>The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class’ progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. <b>Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock.</i></p>
<p><b>PvE Extended List of Available Weapons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heavy</b>: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Tactical</b>: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Assault</b>: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol</li>
<li><b>Bulwark</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Sniper</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine</li>
<li><b>Vanguard</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game.</i></p>
<p><i>Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This isn’t the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement.</i></p>
<p><strong>New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol</strong></p>
<p><em>Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode</strong></p>
<p><i>This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go.</i></p>
<p><b>Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode</b></p>
<p><i>This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up.</i></p>
<p><b>Public Test Server (PTS)</b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward.</i></p>
<p><i>The PTS will be closed for now, but we’ll reopen it once we’ll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.</i></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>​Gameplay &amp; Balancing tweaks</h2>
<h3>Progression Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Rebalance Rewards in the Eternal War Mode&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Match rewards are increased by 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Base EXP for PvE is increased</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Base XP for all difficulties in Operation Mode is increased by 10%.</p>
<h3>PvE Weapon Perks Update</h3>
<p><i>With this update we are rolling out a massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks. As a result all weapons received buffs one way or another.</i></p>
<p><i>Some notes regarding our future plans in terms of balancing: I want to say that I’m not a big fan of changing too many things at the same time. It is hard to predict the outcome, it’s a risk of introducing bugs and not every change is a simple number change. Past 2 patches changelogs were several pages long. I’m more in favor of gradual improvements of the game rather than chaotic changes back and forth. This means that we do see your feedback on some of the class perks and weapons etc, even looking at the current weapon perks rework I feel like we could have done a better job with plasma weapons and power sword perks.</i></p>
<p><i>There will be a second pass on class, weapon and prestige perks. Probably around Patch 8. I do think that those systems are in much much better shape than they were before patches and on release, the scope of the second pass will be smaller.</i></p>

</ul>
<h3>Class Perks Update</h3>
<p><b>Tactical</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiating Impact</b>: Fixed incorrect bonus stack with Auspex Scan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sniper</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fixed incorrect stacking values of Sniper’s <b>Renewal</b> and <b>Squad Renewal</b> perks.&nbsp;</i><i>This resulted in following changes:</i></li>
<li><b>Squad Renewal</b>: Fixed incorrect ability charge restoring (15% instead of planned 10%).</li>
<li><b>Renewal</b>: Fixed typo in the description (5% ability charge restored instead of actual 15%).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Heavy</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced Force</b>: Fixed bonus to melee hold attacks that was mistakenly working in addition to bonus to all melee attacks.</li>
<li>General Balancing</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Assault (PvE only)</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jump Pack Ability</b>: recharge speed increased by 10%.</li>
<li><b>Contested Heals Restoring by Ground Pound was changed</b>: Ground Pound restores 30% of max contested health, regardless of the type of enemy and their number. When hitting with Ground Pound, 30% of max contested health is restored.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is a major buff to Assault survivability, because previously its contested health restore depended on too many factors. Now it is significantly increased and will be consistent.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a maximum cap to restore fade HP per action; and a max target to restore health per action to the following weapons:a</li>
<li>Multi-Melta</li>
<li>Melta Rifle</li>
<li>Heavy&nbsp;Plasma Incinerator</li>
<li>Plasma Incinerator</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This change may sound drastic on paper, but in reality the limit isn’t that strict. It only prevents situations where a single shot from Melta could restore the entire health bar when hitting only 3-4 enemies at the same time. Plus, the contested health restore will be more consistent now.</i></p>
<p>Firearms (PvE only)</p>
<p><i>We are continuing to polish up weapon balance and I think we are in a good spot right now where all weapons are viable on Absolute difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>Sure, some of them are still worse than others and we will continue to tweak them. Our next big objective is to take a closer look at weapon versions balance within the same archetype. Especially melee weapons.</i></p>
<p><b>Occulus Bolt Carbine&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>Master-Crafted – Alpha</i></b> (Accuracy) version of the Occulus Bolt Carbine has -15% spread now instead of the +15% spread.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Multi-Melta</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the bug where the rate-of-fire versions of the Multi-Melta did not have an increased rate of fire. Now, the Master-Crafted version has a 15% increase in RoF, the Artificer version has a 25% increase, and the Relic version has a 35% increase.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bolt Rifle (all versions)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Base damage increased by 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Auto Bolt Rifle</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Base damage increased by 5%. Headshot damage increased by 15%.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Instigator Bolt Carbine</b></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><b>Bolt Carbine (ONLY Marksman Bolt Carbine versions)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Max ammo increased by one magazine.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bolt Pistol</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Max ammo increased by two magazines. Base damage increased by 5%. Headshot damage increased by 15%.</li>

<ul>
<li>Reworked versions of the weapon:</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Retro gaming used to require a lot of hard work. Getting old consoles to play happily with modern, flatscreen displays was a constant challenge that wearied the very idea of it, ultimately making it an easier option to put everything in the loft and play the latest Call of Duty instead. That’s no longer the case, though, with retro handhelds becoming an affordable and fun option for playing all your older games, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H is one of the cheapest retro gaming devices on the planet, coming in for less than £40 in the UK – it’s listed as having a <a href="https://r36h.com/">$49.99 RRP</a> but our unit was listed on AliExpress for a slightly ridiculous £18.27 with a 64GB memory card, before shipping and fees. The handheld shows some signs of that accessible price point, but its quality far exceeds the expectations you might have for a console priced this low.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in pure white, though the R36H is also available in grey, transparent black, purple or orange. Laid out horizontally with buttons on either side of the screen, it shares a similar outlook to Retroid’s older Pocket devices, with a chunky, slightly boxy aesthetic. It’s not sleek or premium-looking like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, but it’s charming in its own way. For the price I wasn’t expecting it to look or feel as good as it does, and it immediately sets you up for a positive experience.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H has a 3.5” IPS display, with a 640×480 resolution. Its 4:3 ratio makes it ideal for older games, and it’s plenty bright and vibrant. Frankly, it’s a continual source of surprise every time you boot a game up how good the display is, and for the type of games the R36H is capable of playing, you couldn’t ask for more.</p>

<p>Internally, the R36H is equipped with a RK3326 chipset and 1GB of DDR3L RAM. It’s definitely not the most powerful device out there, but for retro games up to and including the Dreamcast, it provides enough power to keep everything running smoothly, and relatively efficiently.</p>
<p>It uses Arkos 2.0, an open-source Linux-based operating system, that does exactly what it needs to, in so far as it lets you dump a frontend like Emulation Station onto it that pulls together your ROMS into different categories, with some smart artwork and labels to make it all make sense.</p>
<p>You’ll find Arkos on a batch of Powkiddy and Anbernic devices, and it’s been around for long enough to be well-optimised, keeping you gaming for longer, and with decent performance. The system as a whole is a little on the slow side, so hopping in and out of games can feel lethargic, but in-game, you’ll never notice. It boasts a 3000mAh battery – though its own advertising gets confused between 3000mAh and 3500mAh, but either way it’s plenty to keep you going for between 5 and 6 hours, and maybe even longer if you’re playing less demanding titles. One annoyance is that the battery LED can’t be turned off, and it’s lit at all times, even when you’re not playing. You can choose between it being red or green though, so… there’s that.</p>

<p>Everything has been stripped back in the R36H, and when you consider the price, that’s not surprising. There’s no Bluetooth or WiFi here, so any updates or connections need to be done via wired connections, or installing data onto your MicroSD cards. There are two MicroSD slots on the R36H, one for your OS, and the other for your ROMS, and they do exactly what you need of them. It makes working with the R36H slightly clunky, but chances are this is a device that would serve well as a gift, or a starting point for the retro gaming hobby, rather than the end point like the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, there’s some additional functionality with HDMI output via a USB-C OTG connection, which is a nice inclusion.</p>
<p>One of the best things about the Boyhom R36H is the D-pad. It’s sturdy, responsive, and ideal for classic retro games like Mario or Metroid. Given the price, I expected the different inputs to feel cheap, but that’s mostly not the case. The face buttons aren’t quite as good, being fractionally raised from the unit’s main body, and the travel feels ever so slightly too long, but they still do a decent job of responding to your inputs in games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Kid Chameleon.</p>
<p>The two analogue sticks are laid out asymmetrically, and for some people, this will be a sticking point. While it’s aping the Xbox or Nintendo Switch layouts, it does mean that the D-pad is at the bottom of the unit. Depending on how you hold the device, the size of your hands and the games you’re playing, this could make it uncomfortable over long gaming sessions. They’re also pretty short and soft, without much feedback, but they are there, which isn’t always the case for retro-focused devices. It means that you can properly control Dreamcast and later PlayStation 1 games, without having to resort to swapping the D-pad’s functionality, and that’s a big bonus for me.</p>

<p>The other controls are solid, with digital shoulder buttons that wrap around the top corners of the R36H, and two further inputs on top which are easily reachable with the tips of your fingers. Most retro games won’t use both sets, but they’re solid and useable if you need to call on them.</p>
<p>We’re here for retro gaming, and thankfully the R36H allows you to do that, and it does an especially good job with older titles from the 16-bit era and below. I love a good shoot ‘em up, and Aeroblaster – or Air Busters depending on where you played it – remains one of my all-time favourites. Here it runs flawlessly in its Arcade rendition, with a decent frame rate, and unspectacular but well-represented audio. This is retro gaming running through imperfect emulators, so support isn’t going to be perfect across the board – I found audio issues in the arcade Mortal Kombat games that weren’t present in other games, for example – so if you’re coming at this as your first entry into the hobby, don’t expect everything in your ROM collection to work straight out of the box.</p>
<p>The speakers on the R36H aren’t great. They’re thin-sounding, firing downwards into your hands and relying on how you place your palms to get the best audio, but they do have plenty of volume. That volume is controlled by two digital buttons on the top of the unit, and there is a 3.5mm socket for a wired headphone connection, which is the best way to hear your favourite game themes. I’ve been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Tactics, and the soundtrack sounded great when playing on the R36H with headphones – it’s definitely my recommended way to play.</p>
