		<p>It’s been a blowout week of news and announcements for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and we were lucky enough to be invited out to the hands on event in Paris to experience everything that’s new and coming to the console. An awful lot of people are going to still be on the fence (especially as other world events occurred), but there are some exciting games and intriguing features to entice through the first year of Switch 2, I think.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally all the headlines were dominated by the Nintendo Direct for the Nintendo Switch 2, with big game reveals, price and release date, and then the scramble to find all the little asides and caveats that didn’t make it into the main 60-minute stream.</p>

<h2>Games in Review &amp; Featured Articles</h2>
<p>In a change of pace, I’m going to highlight the flush of game previews from going hands on with the Nintendo Switch 2 at the in-person hands on event in Paris.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/mario-kart-world-preview-can-nintendo-revolutionise-the-karting-world-again/"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></a> is looking to really shake up the familiar Mario Kart format with its big open world map and tracks, while keeping the gameplay feeling as crisp and tight as ever.

<p>I also got to share some hands on time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></a>, using the Switch 2 Edition’s enhanced mouse controls which, in general, feel like they can be <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">a game changer for Switch 2 players</a></strong>… even if they’re doomed to be a niche control option.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman </strong>is trying to get the very most amount of playtime from Atomfall, and is enjoying despite a few inventory and travel foibles. The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth upgrade has also bolstered that game’s longevity.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead with all the lovely weather!</p>
