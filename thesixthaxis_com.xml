		<p>Embark Studios has released a new patch for ARC Raiders, with this 1.6.0 patch being quite small in comparison to previous updates. The main issue patch 1.6.0 addresses is stopping players from going out of bounds in the Stella Montis map, and various collision issues that hindered players, causing them to fall through the environment or be shot behind walls.</p>
<p>Here are the full ARC Raiders 1.6.0 patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Removed a zipline that allowed players to get out of bounds on Stella Montis.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed collision that allowed players to vault and fall through a wall in Blue Gate.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed material issues that caused multiple objects to not block bullet fire or ARC vision.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a gap in the collision on Spaceport Launch Tower that allowed players to be shot through the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embark Studios has also announced changes to its patch release schedule, and how often they will be coming. Patch releases and store rotations will be changed to Tuesdays from Thursdays, with the Cold Snap update being the first to come out on a Tuesday. That will release next week. However, the team will be taking some downtime over the Christmas and New Year period, with only critical issues being looked at during that time. Then more regular updates will resume in January.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">review of ARC Raiders</a> a few days ago. Tuffcub said, <em>“Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>
