		<p>Sony has announced the PlayStation Black Friday offers, taking £90 off a disc drive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, £135 off the PS5 Digital Edition, and bringing discounts across their range of accessories too. All these offers will be available from 21st November directly from PlayStation and with these prices setting the temporary MSRP at participating retailers.</p>
<p>Today, we’re pleased to share that PlayStation’s Black Friday offers will be available from November 21&nbsp;for a limited time at <u><a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a></u>&nbsp;and participating retailers (retailer pricing may vary), where players and gift givers can explore a range of offers on PlayStation hardware, games, and accessories.</p>


<p>These are pretty good discounts that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/17/black-friday-2023-get-up-to-140-off-on-ps5-consoles-bundles-best-deals/">match 2023</a>, bringing the PS5 down to £390 and the PS5 Digital Edition down to £295 (which when you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">buy a disc drive for £70</a> makes that the better way to buy the console). Additionally, this is the first Black Friday for PS5 Pro discounts, bringing it down to £610. Still very pricey, but it’s the best price we’ve seen for it so far.</p>
<p>Also at this pricing is the PS5 Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle, which chucks in some exclusive in-game content and currency.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Sony is knocking down the following prices:</p>

<li>£20 off <u><a href="https://www.playstation.com/accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset/">Pulse Elite wireless headset</a></u>, compatible with PS5, PC/Mac, and Bluetooth devices</li>

<li>There will also be deals for new and upgrading PlayStation Plus members</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, Sony will be kicking off the big Black Friday sale on the PlayStation Store for digital games. Keep your eyes peeled for the best digital gaming bargains there!</p>
