		<p>Everyone likes to be winner. It’s one of humanity’s best, and possibly worst, traits, but when it comes to giveaways, winning is better than losing. One lucky reader will have the chance to be that winner, taking home a brand new Turtle Beach Stealth 500 Gaming Headset for PS5, PS4, PC and mobile platforms via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is one of our favourite sub-£100 headsets, earning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">8/10 in our review</a> last year. Praising its looks and comfort, we said, ” The first thing you’ll notice about the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.”</p>
<p>It sounds great, feels great, and will be a fantastic addition to any gaming setup where you’re looking to up your audio game. In order to be in with a chance to win, enter via the form below!</p>
