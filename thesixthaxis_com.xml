		<p>It will probably feel like you’ve got all the time in the world to play games over the next week or two, and my gaming the past seven days has been rather sparse. I’ve dabbled with a little bit of Space Marine 2 and more Darktide – a great one-two punch of big hordes and Warhammer 40K co-op – and dipped a toe back into Helldivers 2 to battle the Illuminate enemies. The definitely make for a good change of pace to the bugs and bots of old, and the new city maps are pretty neat as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played a handful of different games, with The Thaumaturge and Behemoth in for review, and there’s “the ever-present spectre” of Phasmophobia in his life these days. He also briefly gave TemTem a go –&nbsp;“The fact that Palworld is being sued by Nintendo whilst TemTem is out here untouched whilst being the clearest rip off of Pokémon is kinda silly.”</p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is on <strong>Aran’s</strong> plate for a review, which he describes as “a classic Game Boy RPG but with the adult themes turned way up.” He’s also played a bit more of Marvel Rivals with Punisher and Star Lord as his go-to characters, continued on with The Witcher 3 and is just leaving White Orchard, and some more Football Manager 2024, “where I’ve had my contract at Valencia renewed for another 3 years. Probably because I’ve consistently got them into European competitions over the last few seasons and won a couple of trophies. The league eludes me though because of Real Madrid and Barcelona.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> week has mostly featured a combination of Indiana Jones and Nine Sols – “both fantastic games with very different styles and level of challenge. It’s been nice to wander around the world of Indy in between bouts of swearing at difficult boss fights – although I do seem to be faring better in Nine Sols now that I’ve unlocked a few more abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> watched Secret Levels, which had him wanting to go back to finish off the campaign of Space Marine 2… so he did exactly that, and found it an enjoyable romp on the whole. However, most of his play time has been spent with Kingdom Come: Deliverance – “It’s a drastic change of pace compared to Space Marine 2 and one that immerses you in the life of a peasant looking to climb the ranks in medieval society. It’s a game best savoured slowly, and really isn’t for everyone. I’m hoping to roll credits ahead of the sequel’s release.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got to check out if Alien: Rogue Incursion was the Alien: Isolation VR game that everyone’s been dreaming about since 2016, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">sadly found out that it isn’t</a>. I guess we hope that Alien: Isolation 2 has VR built in, now?</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Ade</strong>. He’s been playing Lego Horizon Adventures with his son, as a nice change of pace from Minecraft, and Sea of Stars in co-op with his partner. He “me” time has been completely consumed by Unicorn Overlord, though. He recommends that you play the demo and also get hopelessly addicted to it.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>
