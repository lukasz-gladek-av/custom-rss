		<p>Four thousand, eight hundred and eleven days. One hundred and fifty-eight months and two days. Thirteen years, two months and two days. Whatever way you want to frame it, it’s going to have been a heck of a long time between the launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, should the latter manage to hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">its latest release date on 19th November 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime opera, and from what little we’ve seen of the game so far, it looks like they’re fully embracing all the wild excess and craziness that you’d expect from a fictionalised rendition of Miami and the Florida Keys.</p>



<p>It looks like this will be a bit of a modern-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde style story with its two protagonists. Lucia Caminos is the series’ first female lead, who’s coming fresh out of a stint in prison, while Jason Duval is working for the local drug gangs. The pair are thrust together after a failed bank robbery, and are then swept up in a grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>As good as it will be to have a new GTA single player story, Rockstar and Take Two are really banking on the next rendition of GTA Online picking up where GTA V’s has left off. It’s this mode that has ballooned Take Two’s coffers over the past decade, and the online platform has grown and evolved massively to give players more things to do, more missions, more career paths to follow, and to front for user-generated content. A new GTA Online will necessarily get back to basics without feeling too hollow. A slow rollout of content was a big part of Red Dead Online’s rapid decline, though Rockstar will have a pretty singular focus for GTA.</p>

<p>But will it actually arrive in November? Rockstar games are prone to at least a couple delays, and GTA 6 has already had two. With its official announcement and reveal in December 2023, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">the tail was pinned on a 2025 release date</a>, but as the higher ups lifted the blindfold to see if they’d hit the target, they realised they’d need to have another go. So it was that by the middle of last year, they decided to get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">a bit more specific and target May 2026</a> instead. Any closer? Not quite. Let’s try November 2026 now.</p>
<p>The problem is that, while there’s still an awful lot of people excited for the next GTA, each delay and announcement has kept the game release at least a year into the future. That’s far away enough that you can absolutely imagine the team getting to that latest six month deadline and realising they, once again, need a bit more time.&nbsp;In the here and now, that means we still have GTA 6 right up there within our top 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, but we’re a touch more excited for a couple of other titles…</p>

		<p>Mutliverse has announced that it is delaying the launch of its colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid PAX Autocratica by a month to address performance, stability, and balancing issues that have been raised. Initially, PAX Autocratica was going to launch on February 2nd into early access, but now it will launch on March 4th instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9bREKlyMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the dev team at Multiverse said, <em>“After review by the Supreme Council, a directive has been issued regarding the deployment of Pax Autocratica. <wbr>The Early Access launch has been rescheduled to March 4, 2026. This decision was not made lightly. Recent internal evaluations and field reports have identified several areas that require further refinement before the State is ready to open Early Access operations. <wbr>These include:<wbr><wbr><wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Core balancing adjustments<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Stability and performance improvements<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Initial onboarding and tutorial refinement</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, we have received a significant number of Quality of Life requests that we intend to address Our objective remains unchanged: <wbr>to launch Early Access with a build that is stable and fully enjoyable.”</em></p>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also previously confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse has previously made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em>&nbsp;“1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark has released a new update for ARC Raiders, and while update 1.11.0 is not a big one it does come off the back of a big milestone. Embark has confirmed that since launch ARC Raiders has had 12 million players, and that everyone who has logged into the game since launch up to January 13th would be gifted a gilded pickaxe raider tool. The update itself addresses a key card exploit so players can no longer keep them after use, and balancing changes to a couple of weapons. There is also the launch of the Abyss cosmetic set.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpeJjQDXNAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kettle – <wbr>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
<li>Trigger ‘Nade – Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
<li><wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.<wbr></li>
<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders Review</a></h2>
<p>In our ARC Raiders review, Tuffcub said, <em>“ARC Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Traveller’s Refrain Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/travellers-refrain-review/</link>
            <guid>1405426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Traveller’s Refrain is a game that will make you feel sleepy. I don’t mean to suggest the game is boring, far from it. Rather, this isometric Zelda-like has a meditative thoughtful vibe that brings on a state of mindful chill that could, just could, make you briefly close your eyes. For a few minutes. Just make sure you’ve got your little wrist holders on to avoid any unnecessary damage to your Switch when you nod off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Traveler's Refrain - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXhR--g3f9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Traveller is a rather mysterious fellow with a lovely, well-trimmed beard. Awaking in a dream-like forest, with memories of past traumatic events clearly haunting him, our surprisingly trendy hero must journey on a quest of discovery, learning more about himself and this world he now inhabits in the process. </p>


<p>If this all sounds a little navel-gazing for you don’t worry, developer Red Essence Games smartly follow the show-don’t-tell model, getting out of the players’ way for the most part and keeping dialogue brief. As such, you pick up on the melancholic mindful elements in brief breaks between all the action, rather than being subsumed in sadness by never-ending dialogue.</p>
<p>Exploration and puzzling are where Traveller’s Refrain excels. Puzzles are basic but satisfying, demanding you find and light all the beacons, as an early example. It’s nothing you haven’t solved before, but these puzzles are well delivered. Even better, there are some fascinatingly fresh characters to encounter, many unlike anything I’ve encountered before in an RPG. </p>


<p>Visually distinctive, meeting new NPCs is the real drive behind your journeying. It also helps that everything looks sumptuous too, the hard-drawn cartoon aesthetic is brimming with details, and full of flair, creating a distinctive game world to explore. No mean feat when your game is set in a forest, likely the most done to death setting in all of video gamedom. That and ice levels, I guess.</p>
<p>Combat is reminiscent of a calmer version of Hades. Traveller can dodge dash with the best of them, nimbly avoiding flailing stone golems, sentient giant blobs of gloop and enormous plumes of flames. Armed with numerous close combat weapons over the course of this sixteen-hour adventure, the risk-reward of Traveller’s Refrain’s combat is clear, the player must get in close to dish out damage, before rapidly escaping enemy reprisal. </p>
<p>That’s not the only weapon at Traveller’s disposal, as he can also strum out a tune or two on his guitar. Basically, his wizard book, spells are summoned by flicks of the thumb stick in different directions. The player has to remember these, rather then being constantly prompted, though you can remind yourself of the inputs in Traveller’s song book. As such, there’s a delightful sense of risk as Traveller stands still to strum his guitar in the middle of a bunch of foes in a desperate attempt to heal himself. Get it wrong and it’s game over, get those inputs right, and you have a chance.</p>

<p>It’s exciting stuff, with hordes of enemies on-screen at anyone time. Though this isn’t without its problems, as Traveller may be fast and smooth in his movements, but the frame rate on Switch 1 certainly isn’t. In handheld mode, the game is almost unplayable at times. Even when there’s no onscreen fireworks, and Traveller is simply running back and forth, the frame rate chugs along like a particularly decrepit diesel train. Docked is better, of course, but the frame rate still struggles far more often than it should. Which is a real shame, as there’s some great Zelda-akin puzzling and exploration to be had here.</p>
