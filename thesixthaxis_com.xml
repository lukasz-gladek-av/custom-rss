		<p>A new update for Battlefield 6 will go live today, it is a “smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6”. The patch changes melee attacks, ladders, and jet fighter combat amongst other things.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes:</p>


<h2 id="major-updates">Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li>
<li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li>
<li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changelog">CHANGELOG</h2>
<h3 id="vehicles">VEHICLES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</li>
<li>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weapons">WEAPONS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li>
<li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li>
<li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li>
<li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li>
<li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks. Sprint is now only interrupted until the attack reaches its target, rather than for the full duration of the animation.</li>
<li>In the Firing Range, target dummies can now take damage while in the process of getting back up.</li>
<li>Shooting with a suppressor now emits a small muzzle flash when viewed from close range only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gadgets">GADGETS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GDPIS was not destroyed when targeted by the XFGM-6D Recon Drone, Defibrillators, or the Repair Tool.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Sniper Decoy did not properly hide scope glints from nearby snipers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assault Ladder</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where ladders positioned above the player could not be entered.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where soldiers could be launched unexpectedly when attempting to enter a ladder.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="ui-hud">UI &amp; HUD:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new option allowing players to customize the reticle colour inside weapon and gadget scopes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where home screen focus navigation could become locked to the bulletin.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where weapon menus displayed incorrect Reload Time stats for LMGs.</li>
<li>Soldier lightning improvements to the front-end</li>
<li>Improved front-end lighting to enhance the visual quality of soldier characters.</li>
<li>The Reticle Colour option now correctly updates reticle colours for Thermal Scopes and other supported gadgets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfx-video">VFX &amp; Video:</h3>

</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="map-modes">MAP &amp; MODES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an edge case in Gauntlet mode “Data Extraction” where the drone could disappear permanently if drives were deposited at the exact moment it landed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ui-hud">UI &amp; HUD:</h3>
<p><em>Battle Royale</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the armor bar could disappear intermittently.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Airburst Incendiary Launcher icon appeared as a grenade in the loot feed.</li>
