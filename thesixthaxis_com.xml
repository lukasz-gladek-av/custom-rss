		<p>There is a new roguelite deckbuilder chugging its way into town in the form of Fogpiercer, which is being developed by Mad Cookies Studio and published by Hooded Horse. Fogpiercer is set in a post apocalyptic world where the trains still run, but are the targets of bandits who want whatever the train carriages are carrying. Your mission is to fight off these bandits and get the train to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fogpiercer - Announcement Trailer | Roguelite Deckbuilder On a Train" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement trailer of Fogpiercer shows how the game works in practice. As you can see, the train has its set route to take, making it easy for bandits to roll up in their own vehicles and attack. However, the nature of this deckbuilder means you can equip the train with different carriages, and each of those as their own deck. These decks contain various cards that equip the train with offensive and defensive capabilities. Each ability has its own way of dealing with enemies, with some forcing enemies to crash into each other or get caught under the train. As the train chugs along, you will need to pick the route to travel, with different dangers presenting themselves.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Fogpiercer, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219010/Fogpiercer/">there is a demo available on Steam</a>. Fogpiercer is due out in 2026 for PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I am exhausted this week, and that’s only slightly because I’ve repeatedly been up until the wee hours of the morning playing a bunch of video games for review. Chief among them has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> on console, which is such an incredible game, made only slightly more annoying by playing with a controller. Other than that, I didn’t really get on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, which feels lacking the same soul as previous Sonic kart racers, but I’ve quietly enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/formula-legends-review/">Formula Legends</a>, even if it is a bit limited.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played the slightly worrying heading to the hospital for an op game, but has happily come out the other side of it, and his nose only flashed a couple of times so the doctor probably did a fairly good job. He told us, “I’ve got back into Breath of Fire II on my Retroid and really enjoying the benefits of a fast-forward feature for the random battles.” Besides that, he’s hoping to get back to reviewing, at least as soon as he can sit in a chair again.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is working on Ghost of Yotei, and that’s literally all he’s allowed to say about that, so we’ll move on to <strong>Jim</strong> finished Sword of the Sea, saying, “It offers some great visual set pieces but little in the way of compelling gameplay as you cruise around levels, interacting with the occasional node to make water (and marine life) suddenly appear. I was left a little disappointed, as I was expecting something more in line with The Pathless, or even an evolution of that format.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy Tactics: Chronicles of Ivalice for review, and you can find out what he thinks about that next Wednesday. While that’s been going on, <strong>Jason</strong> has been playing a lot of Borderlands 4, saying, “I’ve managed to not experience any bugs, and am really enjoying it. It’s a bit leap from previous games, and with more fluid movement and a strong roster of Vault Hunters and NPCs, it’s just a really good time all around.”</p>


<p>Next up was Ade, telling us that “between bouts of Marvel Rivals I played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-review/">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> for review, which offers a surprisingly innovative take on the standard Hades formula. Also, I’ve spent a frankly shocking amount of my overall leisure time painting my Castigator battle tank for Warhammer 40k!”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light The Beast</a>, Discounty, and Rise of Industry for review. That’s not all though, as he’s been watching Blippo+ which he says is, “Indescribable”.</p>

<p>Continuing the slate of upcoming reviews, <strong>Laura</strong> has been solving all the mysteries this week: a bit of murder in Egypt in the 70’s alongside Poirot in her review of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile, and solving all sorts of haunting cases in 17th century New England in Banishers Ghosts of New Eden!</p>
<p>It’s been a busy week for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing the immersive sim “I have a real job again”. He says, “While it’s interesting and I am enjoying wandering through the realistic render of Canary Wharf, I kinda miss just getting up, walking doggos, writing music and not having to care about anything. Will be seeking out the Sugar Daddy DLC pack so I can return to that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;what has <strong>Tef</strong> played? Well, there was some Strange Antiquities for review later today, a brief refresher of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for his Gamescom preview, and he finished a jaunt through the DLC for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-whips-up-a-mini-matinee-adventure/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which was a nice bitesized adventure.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury have confirmed that the supernatural detective mystery The Séance of Blake Manor will launch on October 27th for PC. Just in time for Halloween. The release date was confirmed during the Convergence Games Showcase, where a brand new trailer was also shown.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATH_4Ea5O6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation. The gameplay consists of speaking to the other people gathered on the island, observing the events that are taking place, and being in the right place at the right time. Time is not a luxury Declan has due to the guests going about their day, so if you are not in certain places you may miss vital evidence that could help solve the case.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/the-seance-of-blake-manor-channels-classic-detective-tales-with-an-irish-supernatural-twist/">The Séance of Blake Manor channels classic detective tales with an Irish supernatural twist</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of The Séance of Blake Manor, Stefan wrote, <em>“Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.”</em></p>

		<p>The most premium of games which is only for premium players, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a>, is absolutely great and there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s your PC that’s rubbish and you don’t know how to configure it. That’s what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/randy-pitchford-reminds-you-that-borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers/">Randy Pritchford say</a>s so we can all ignore the statement released by Gearbox that states:</p>
<p>“We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming. This is our top priority.”</p>



<p data-start="0" data-end="456">Look, folks, let me tell you something very important about Borderlands 4—it runs beautifully.&nbsp; Everybody’s saying it’s one of the smoothest, most incredible games ever made. No performance issues, none. The people trying to say otherwise? Fake news. They’re the same people who always want to tear down great American entertainment, the same tired critics like Jimmy Kimmel, a bad man, who has been wrong about everything from the beginning. Believe me.</p>
<p data-start="458" data-end="780">Borderlands 4 is fast, it’s sharp, it looks amazing—better than anyone thought possible. The developers did a tremendous job, maybe the best job ever. Everybody’s talking about how great it feels, how stable it is, how much fun they’re having. And you know what? They’re right. Because it works perfectly. Zero problems.</p>

<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The fake news media doesn’t want you to enjoy it, they want to make up stories about “frame drops” or “performance problems.” Total lies. Don’t believe them. Ask the gamers, ask the fans—they’ll tell you the truth. Borderlands 4 is a massive success, running flawlessly, and people are loving it more than ever before. It’s a big, beautiful win. And we’re not going to let fake news take that away.</p>
<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">You know me, I like a border, big beautiful borders with big fences and to keep the robotic pyschos out of my game. We need more Borderlands like this because it’s the biggliest and best Borderlands ever.</p>

		<p>A new video for Football Manager 26 has been released by Sports Interactive, and the core subject is the introduction of women’s football to the series. The video shows how Sports Interactive has incorporated women’s football into Football Manager, confirming there will be 14 leagues across 11 countries with WSL and WSL2 among those leagues. Women’s football has been fully integrated into the game, allowing players to have both men and women’s league active in their games, or you can choose to play either men’s football or women’s football only.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | Introducing Women's Football" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJ39Hd-O-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The women’s football database will include over 40,000 players as well, making it the biggest women’s football database in any game. Women’s player stats are equivalent to the men’s stats, but also within the context of the women’s game. Sports Interactive has gone further with animations with women footballers being used to motion capture movements, so the on the pitch action resembles close to the reality of how women play football. Sports Interactive has also confirmed that this is just the first step for women’s football in the Football Manager series, with the database set to expand and the experience to get more depth in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/10/football-manager-26-releases-on-november-4th/">Sports Interactive recently confirmed that Football Manager 26 releases on November 4th</a> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, Game Pass, and mobile exclusively through Netflix. Football Manager 26 Touch will launch on December 4th for Switch.</p>

			<p>Codemasters might have the official F1 license, but that hasn’t stopped indie developers from creating their own take on the premier racing class. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/new-star-gp-review/">New Star GP</a> drew on classic Sega arcade racing thrills last year, but speeding toward a fierce braking zone is Formula Legends, the fresh-faced rookie, which has taken the hard-nosed, serious sport and given it a cute, hyper-deformed makeover, all the while attempting to retain the competitive racing action of its inspiration. It’s a pretty successful attempt too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Formula Legends - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgUCx--1qfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Formula Legends is not officially licensed by the FIA, so there’s no official drivers, no official constructors, and no official tracks. What there is, however, is a roster of drivers inspired by their real-life counterparts, so you can welcome Danny Ricchiordi and Luis Hammerton to the sport, rather than Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton. You can laugh your little socks off at Batteri Voltas and Charlie Lacreme, or just enjoy my personal favourite, Hans Troll, simply because of how much it might annoy Lance… or more probably his dad.</p>


<p>Formula Legends takes you through the history of F1, through a lightly distorted lens. Starting in the 1960s, the central Story Mode offers a range of races in each era, providing a taste of the different cars, steadily improving technology, and the changes to the layout of each track over the years.</p>
<p>While they’re not allowed to use the official names for each location, the different tracks and their alternate layouts across the decades are close enough to their real-world inspirations to let you pick out the sweeping curves of Spa-Francorchamps and the iconic setting at Monza. They’re definitely ‘inspired by’ though, so if you think you know the Melbourne Park circuit like the back of the hand, you might need to prepare to stare questioningly at the skin there. In some cases the tracks are mirrored too, presumably to avoid too many angry looks from license holders, so you come away with a flavour of the sport, rather than a full course.</p>


<p>The little F1 race cars we get in Formula Legends are undoubtedly cute to look at, but they’re almost as difficult to drive as the real thing. Dropping things down to Easy, alongside a couple of driving assists for braking and traction control, will likely see you whizz by the competition, and Formula Legends becomes wholly approachable here. Meanwhile, playing on Normal really ramps the difficulty up, and it’s a welcome and rewarding challenge where track knowledge and braking points need to be spot on. The Hard setting following that isn’t as much of a leap, but you will need to drive more or less flawlessly to be in with a chance of a podium.</p>
<p>The AI drivers won’t make that very easy. To say that they’re aggressive would be to downplay just how little they care about whose corner it is, and you’ll be glad to discover that damage is a health bar, rather than individual pace-wrecking components. They’re not really all that smart, and you’ll see them careening off at various points, but when Logan Sargeant was still in the sport up until a year ago, that remains fairly realistic.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Formula Legends handling model. It’s undoubtedly an arcade racer, and they feel more like the toy cars they look like than open-wheel race cars, but once you’ve got into the flow of things, sweeping around corners with surety becomes second nature. You can’t treat it like a simulation, and if you do, you’ll actually come off far worse than you might expect.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nods to realism though, including having to select the right tyres, coping with their degradation, and conducting pitstops. These involve a fun little mini-game where you have to match the right button press, all the while repairing and refuelling your car, before mashing the analogue stick buttons in, and it definitely adds to the experience, especially in a tight race. Alongside that, the attention to detail given to each era is a real treat, from the sepia tones and the pitstop tents of the early years through to the inclusion of BRS – definitely not DRS – in the modern age.</p>

<p>Formula Legends is a small-scale taste of F1, and that becomes more apparent the longer you spend with it. There are no multiplayer modes here, whether local or online, and that’s a real shame for an approachable arcade racer. Equally, there are only 14 tracks, and while that number is buoyed by the different renditions of them across each era, they are fundamentally the same track. When the sport has expanded as far as it has, with sprint races and 24 race seasons, that means there’s some obvious gaps.</p>
<p>Those gaps continue onto the grid, so races host 14 cars, rather than the 20 we’re used to, and the maximum championship length you can create is 14 too – fine if you want to recreate a season from the 1980s, but limited for the modern sport. I’d really like the option of multi-season championships, and racers moving about, but that’s clearly not what Formula Legends is designed for. This is an indie game created with a genuine love for the sport, and it offers a wholly different take from its peers.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is generally very good, with crisp, clear visuals that make the most of the cute art design. There’s the tiniest hint of pop in, but it fades into the distance so much that you won’t notice while you’re concentrating on the more immediate racing line. We did also get to check out the Nintendo Switch version, and that’s a wholly different story, with glaring pop-in, massively reduced resolution, and the lack of analogue triggers causing all sorts of issues. Make sure to pick up the PC, PS5 or Xbox versions, and cross your fingers for a Switch 2 update…</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent hit back at Sony’s lawsuit over Light of Motiram]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/tencent-hit-back-at-sonys-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-hit-back-at-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram.1302315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tencent have rebuffed Sony’s claims that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a> is a “slavish clone” of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon franchise</a> and that it copies multiple elements from they games that would confuse consumers.&nbsp; Sony asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram, Tencent are asking for the whole thing to be thrown out of court.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants—about the unreleased video game&nbsp;Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony’s game&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn and its spinoffs,” the complaint reads, according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">TheGamePost.</a></p>
<p>“At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony’s exclusive domain.”</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the rest of the legal waffle but the short version is that Tencent claim that elements such as a red-haired heroine, robotic creatures, and ruined cities are tropes that can be found in many video games, and they give examples such as Far Cry, BioMutant, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>. Sony themselves published a Ninja Theory game with a red haired heroine, Heavenly Sword, but that doesn’t get a mention.</p>

<p>“In Sony’s telling, Horizon Zero Dawn is ‘like no fictional world created before [or] since.’ That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolize through this lawsuit,” say Tencent.</p>
<p>That line about Sony’s own developers may be a problem for the PlayStation giant. Sony released a documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn, and in it, Jan-Bart Van Beek, the art director for the game, references Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and suggests the new Horizon title is similar: “I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points.”</p>
<p>“Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game,” say Tencent.&nbsp;Enslaved is an action game with mechanical beasties set in a ruined landscape but the hero is male, the red-haired character, Trip, is not playable.</p>

<p>Looking at Enslaved at first glance it does resemble Horizon but I don’t think Tencent have much of a chance, Sony’s complaint isn’t really about claiming all the individual elements are their own, they are claiming the combination of all these things, along with the art style and music, make Light of Motiram a copy of Horizon.&nbsp; Their claim is comparable to a claim over music copyright; there are only so many notes and everyone uses them, but if you put them in the same order as someone else, then you are making a copy.</p>
<p>Tencent have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page</a> and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine.</p>
<p>Now, can we please, please have that remaster of Enslaved now?</p>
