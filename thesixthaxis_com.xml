		<p>91Act has announced that the side scrolling roguelike BlazBlue Entropy Effect will launch globally on July 22nd for Android and iOS, following an earlier release in China which saw the game get downloaded six million times. BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a spin off from the BlazBlue fighting series, taking the combat style and action from that to embed it in a different genre. The game is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">Steam</a>, where it has over 25,000 reviews and sits at very positive.</p>

		<p>Jelly Troops has been revealed by developer Nukenin Co and publisher Phoenixx Inc, with the game looking like a good, casual real time strategy title focused around capturing flags. The setting pits two wizards and their armies of jellies against each other, with players having to make critical decisions that could lead to victory in these capture the flag missions.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Release on Sept. 17th 2025]A Squishy, Strategic Caputre-the-Flag Battle &quot;Jelly Troops&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nRjcedP8cA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Jelly Troops&nbsp;is as deep as it is cute. The inviting blue-pink aesthetic contrasts against very tense gameplay,”</em> says Waken, solo developer of Jelly Troops. <em>“The mind games are near-endless. We can’t wait to watch the meta develop over time!”</em></p>
<p>In Jelly Troops, players will need to literally grow their armies by planting Magic Fruits at base, with these fruits producing jellies. These Magic Fruits are dotted around the map, so this in itself becomes a fight for resources. It won’t be as simple as grabbing the fruits though, as powerful golems also patrol the maps. These golems can kill in one hit, so you need to find ways to move them out of your way and make them an inconvenience for your enemy. To win, you need to capture the flag and there are different approaches to this. The most obvious is by having a bigger army and overwhelming defences, but you can also send in smaller groups to sneak in and steal the flag. Various power ups will either help or hinder, with powers such as invisibility, lightning strikes, and summoning guardians all having their own impact on how things will unfold.</p>

<p>Jelly Troops has been announced for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of September 17th.</p>
