		<p>All children of the 90s love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – or Hero Turtles depending on which backwater country doesn’t allow children near the word ‘Ninjas’. The truth is they’re both heroes and ninjas, and they’re having a very 2020 revival right now, with a series of digital adventures showing that there’s plenty of hero left in those half-shells. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover is the newest game in the canon, but, as the title suggests, this is going to be a very different kind of adventure for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello.</p>

<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover – I swear, that’s going to be TMNT: TT by the time we get to the end of this news story – takes our beloved turtles into uncharted territory, because unlike recent hits like beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">TMNT: Shredders Revenge</a>, or the rogue-like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>, Tactical Takeover is a turn-based strategy, owing more to games like X-COM or Fire Emblem than it does to Streets of Rage. It’s an interesting idea, and given that the team are one of the most beloved groups in the last thirty years it feels like it’ll pay off. I particularly appreciate the range of experiences that Turtles fans can enjoy right now, and rather than resting on the simple ‘smacking people about’ action that you’d expect, this offers a new cerebral take on the green group.</p>
<p>What’s even better, is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">you can try it out right now</a>, with a demo appearing as part of the Steam Next-Fest. It’s a real blast, and you can stay tuned for a full preview of it in the coming days. The Steam Next Fest demo features a tutorial and a modified version of the first chapter of the game, inviting players to experience the turtle action first-hand as they take on the Foot Clan.</p>


<p>It sounds as though they’re going through some stuff too, with both Splinter and Shredder dead, and the beloved gang starting to fall apart. Hopefully you can keep them together – though not if that’s strategically a bad idea, you need to watch out for area of effect attacks, of course.</p>
<p>The game’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, which is the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., best known for his work as a lead developer on I Am Your Beast, CLICKOLDING, El Paso, Elsewhere, and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. We’re certainly intrigued, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more ahead of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover’s launch on PC later this year.</p>
