		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/09/amplitude-studios-goes-independent-and-splits-off-from-sega/">freshly independent Amplitude Studios</a> has revealed Endless Legend 2, a fantasy 4X sequel that looks to shake things up with shifting seasons and world-changing tidefalls on its ocean planet. The game is coming to PC via Early Access sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Endless Legend 2 will take us to the doomed oceanic planet of Saiadha, its islands battered by shifting seasons, fearsome storms and tidefall. They will transform the world around you, forcing you to adapt your approach to take advantage.</p>
<p>Each race will have a specific philosophy to how they should expand their empire, with heroes used to reveal the story of each faction, while providing the linchpins for your growing relationships with others – whether diplomatic or through conquest. They’ll also be at the forefront as you try to peel back the mysteries of the world, facing ancient perils and uncovering the planet’s deeply hidden secret.</p>
<p>Amplitude Studios regained independence from Sega last year, the publisher selling the studio back to members of its internal team, letting its legacy and franchises –&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless</a> series and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a> – live on.</p>

<p>Another thing that will live on is Amplitude’s form of collaborative development with their community, bringing fans into the process by inviting them to play early versions of their games to gather feedback. If you’re keen to hop in, you can apply to become an Amplitude Insider by <a href="https://ampli.click/insidersprogramsurvey">filling out this survey</a>, with the team aiming to share more details in the coming weeks to those who are selected. This will precede a stint in Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>While the last Endless series game was the tower defence shooter hybrid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless Dungeon</a>,&nbsp;Amplitude’s last 4X game was Humankind, a fresh take on the historical 4X form. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">our Humankind review</a> we awarded it an&nbsp;impressive 9/10. <em>“Humankind is as deep as you could possibly want from a 4X strategy game, but the constant addition of new things to think about never feels overwhelming because everything’s explained so well, and often with a good bit of humour too. </em><em>It’s an excellent game, and if you’ve never delved into the 4X genre before, this might be your best chance to do so.”</em></p>
