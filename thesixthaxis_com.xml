		<p>It both feels like an awful long time, and barely any real time at all since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control burst onto the scene in 2019</a>, putting Remedy Entertainment back on the map after their split with Microsoft and bringing millions of new fans into their expanding supernatural universe. Expectations are much higher for its recently announced sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONTROL Resonant – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Control Resonant was revealed at The Game Awards, putting a name to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">a sequel</a> that we knew was in development since all the way back in 2022.</p>


<p>Things have gone from bad to worse at The Oldest House and the Federal Bureau of Control, and salvation will come from another rather unlikely direction. After Jesse Faden found herself suddenly wrapped up into becoming the FBC’s Director, it’s now Dylan Faden, her brother who was confined at the FBC for years as the character P6, who has to fight back a mysterious cosmic entity.</p>


<p>This threat has been able to spill out of the confined of The Oldest House and into Manhattan, creating a large, but unfamiliar rendition of the world as the cosmic force reshapes the environment, breaks down laws of physics and reality, and even extends into Dylan’s psyche. It’s all a bit Doctor Strange and Inception in the announcement trailer, but expect it to get much more twisted and darker.</p>
<p>Luckily Dylan finds new powers awakening within him to fight back, with Jesse having disappeared. There looks to be more of a melee action adventure RPG tone to this, after the third person shooting of the original, but the snippets of gameplay from the reveal trailer look truly spectacular. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

<p>Control Resonant was originally announced back in November 2022 when Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> an agreement to co-develop and co-publish the new game. At that point Control 2, as it was known, was still in the initial pre-production concept stage, with an initial budget of €50 million.</p>
<p>Things changed in 2024 when Remedy Entertainment has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> franchise as a whole from 505 Games, including both the already-released 2019 game, and any future projects.&nbsp; Remedy asked for this freedom in order to give themselves a fresh chance to either self-publish the games or find a new publishing partner for these two games.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they did a few months later when Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> a strategic partnership which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>Control Resonant will launch in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Mac.</p>
<p><em>Alright, that’s all but one of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> accounted for. Can you figure out which title has landed in the top spot? Come back tomorrow for our chart topper to confirm or defy your expectations.</em></p>
