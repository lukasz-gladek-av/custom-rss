		<p>Nintendo has announced an overhaul for how digital game licenses are handled on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with the new Virtual Game Card.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The change will make digital game use much more like how you use and share physical game cartridges. When purchasing a digital game, it will be loaded as a Virtual Game Cartridge, giving you access to that game on that particular system.</p>
<p>Using a new dedicated management screen, you can manage those games to load and eject them individually. Ejecting from one Switch system will then let you load it onto a second Switch system – your account is seemingly limited to using this feature through two systems only, and will require local communication in order to bind them together.</p>
<p>That’s a bit of an upheaval when compared to playing your games on any Switch console simply by having an online connection to authenticate your login.</p>

<p>However, this does present new opportunities for families and friends. You will now be able to lend to members within your NIntendo Switch Online family group. This again requires a local wireless connection in order to do so, and you can only lend one game at a time to each person. Additionally, they will only be available for up to 2 weeks before they are automatically returned to you.</p>
<p>This seems like a better system for families to share one copy of a big single player game, perhaps, and certainly when compared to the tricky primary account for game sharing that has been a staple of console gaming since the late aughts. It’s not clear yet if this effectively grants that game license to the whole console (if a primary console for another person’s account), or if it’s user specific.</p>
<p>This system will be implemented in a system update for Nintendo Switch in late April, and will apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>
<p>We’ll hopefully have more details soon with a full FAQ to detail the changes, but there’s seemingly both upsides and downsides to this new system for individual and family uses. However, it does seem appropriate to address this, given the likelihood of a lot of people having two generations of console in the relatively near future…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-more-dangerous-after-dark-with-the-z-a-royale-battles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo featured a new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Z-A during the latest Nintendo Direct, giving a look at another, darkerside of the city of Lumios that is the main setting for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer covers a lot of ground for what we’ve previously seen of the game, such as the Wild Zones that Pokémon tend to live in within the city – supposedly safe havens, but not when you’re around and have a Pokéball or two… hundred in your pocket. If they’re hostile to this (and why wouldn’t they be?) then you’ve got the overhauled real time combat to indulge in, and the return of Mega Evolutions.</p>
<p>However, Pokémon Z-A will also feature a day-night cycle, and things get much trickier after night. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>
<p>Once again, there’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time.</p>

		<p>Nintendo shared a new gameplay and story trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, the latest entry in the popular third person take on the genre-defining series. Psychic abilities? A mysterious red and black suit? Tasty…</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently only confirmed for Nintendo Switch and a 2025 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes Samus to the planet Viewros, trapping her in a jungle with a giant tree at its heart. You’ll scan relics and statues to find the paths forward, while also running into hostile alien creatures that live in the gloom.</p>
<p>Samus naturally has her suit and weapons, which will be enhanced over the course of the game, but there’s also new psychic abilities that will be granted to Samus – she’s got a new story arc as a “chosen one” it seems, which is a bit generic. These could be used to manipulate energy balls and mechanisms in environment, but can also apply in combat, being used to guide the trajectory of weapons fire to hit the target.</p>

<p>Confirmed for release this year, there’s plenty speculation that Metroid Prime 4 will be a cross-gen launch game for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, especially with Nintendo still avoiding pinning an exact date on the game’s launch. Perhaps a second news drop will come next week at the Switch 2 Direct?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>
<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>
