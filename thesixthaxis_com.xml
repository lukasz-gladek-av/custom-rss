		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</p>

		<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu has held a video call with staff outside Japan and announced a “fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization”. Jobs will be cut and those left will be expected to spend more time working in the office. The move is part of a cost-cutting exercise to save 3 billion yen ($19.6 million), although the last attempt at restructuring the company ended up costing the company 9.8 billion&nbsp;yen.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not announced how many people will be let go and said that affected staff will be notified today. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a> are reporting that over 140 people are at risk in the London office, including those working in marketing, QA, and sales.</p>


<p>Alongside this, the company also released a financial statement along with a commentary that stated that they are working with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo on a project “aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies”. Their goal is to “automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027”.</p>
<p>The financial report shows that game sales for the company are down 15% year-on-year but despite this, operating income has increased by 28.8% due to reduced marketing and development costs.</p>

		<p>Call of Duty games have gradually been increasing in size over the years and now take up a significant chunk of your hard drive.&nbsp; Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not expected to buck the trend, as it is going to land somewhere between 130GB and 166GB on PS5.</p>
<p>The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>


<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-beta-impressions/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta impressions</a> here.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Boulies Master Series 2025 Gaming Chair Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/07/boulies-master-series-2025-gaming-chair-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/boulies-master-series-2025-gaming-chair-review.1346734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As the end of the year heads into sight, and as my YouTube algorithm seems set on reminding me, gaming chairs are one of the best ways to upgrade your gaming setup. This time around, we’re checking out Boulies’ latest edition of their Master Series, and it’s fair to say that you’re looking for a gaming chair with a great amount of choice, this is an excellent option.</p>
<p>The Master Series lets you make your first choice with the sizing, with the regular Master Series chair recommended for people between 155cm and 180cm, and weighing up to 110kg. Meanwhile, the Master Max is built for the larger-framed gamer, so that’s anyone standing between 180cm and 200cm, with an increased load that’s capable up to 135kg. Our review unit was in the standard Master Series sizing, but beyond the increased load weight and extra sizing, the designs are fundamentally the same.</p>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your frame, you can select from a range of materials: Ultraflex PU, Water Repellent Fabric, or the top-of-the-range Nappa Leather. With the standard Ultraflex PU pricing currently sitting at £290 in the UK, and the Water Repellent option at £295, the Nappa Leather bringing it up to an ultra-premium £580. That’s a huge difference, but if you’re set on the best of the best, then Boulies gives you that option.</p>
<p>While the leather version is only available in black, the two cheaper finishes come in a range of colours. Our review unit came in water repellent Slate Blue, and I really liked the slightly subdued colour tone, which makes it feel very non-gamer chair. There’s a central black strip through the centre of the chair back, while the seat has two flaring black sections on either side. That’s then further carried through by the black neck pillow that attaches to the top of the chair.</p>


<p>Visually, I think it’s a great-looking chair, and one that manages to retain a certain level of maturity and seriousness. That’s not always the case with gaming chairs, and whether you’re settling in for your hundredth hour of Battlefield, or working on a PowerPoint presentation, this is manages to straddle the line between work and play.</p>
<p>The water repellent fabric they’ve used is very soft, and gentle, and, weirdly, I kind of wanted to find it across the elbow rests too, though that would look pretty odd. Boulies do note that the waterproofing will wear out over time, and that the degradation of that system will come down to how much wear the chair comes in for. So far, there’s no sign of it having lost any of its immunity to an accidental splash of tea or water, but then, I wouldn’t expect it to degrade quite so quickly.</p>
<p>Weird personal expectation aside, the armrests are actually made from soft PU foam. They offer 4D movement – that’s up and down, left and right, forward and back, and rotation on the central axis– and they stay resolutely in the same position once you’ve locked them into place. Adjustments are simple though, so if another person is using the chair, or you suddenly don’t find it’s quite the right fit anymore, the buttons to release them are immediately accessible.</p>

<p>There’s more adjustment to be found elsewhere, starting with the personalised lumbar support. Two dials on each side of the backrest let you alter the placement of the lumbar support, moving it up and down, the supportive bump shifting into the small of your back as needed. It works well, though you’ll likely forget exactly which way the support moves each time you’re using it.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got it all setup how you like it, it’s fair to say that the Boulies Master Chair is hugely comfortable. It’s a little firmer than some gaming chairs, but I actually found that really helpful through longer gaming sessions. You can also change the angle of the backrest, so you can sit studiously upright while working, before leaning all the way back for some more lazy gaming at the end of the day.</p>
<p>As with all gaming chairs, the Boulies Master Series arrived in a massive and heavy box and had to be put together. In the scheme of things, this wasn’t a hard build – you’re talking more like grown-up Duplo rather than Lego Technic – but there are one or two fiddlier moments thanks to having to attach everything to the underside of the seat itself with Allan-key equipped screws.</p>

<p>It took me about half an hour, and while I have put a number of gaming chairs together over the years, I think that anyone with a solid understanding of flat-pack furniture, or who has bought literally anything from IKEA will be at home with what the instructions are asking of you. The only point that you might want to consider is having a second pair of hands for when you’re attaching the chair back, as it’s quite heavy and unwieldy, but I managed it myself without too much problem.</p>
