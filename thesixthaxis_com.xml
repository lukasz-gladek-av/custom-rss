		<p>We liked Dying Light: The Beast. We liked it very much indeed, and it’s fair to say that many of us at TSA Towers have been leaping and climbing and running about its apocalyptic world while smashing up every zombie in sight. We’ve clearly not been the only ones though, with Techland dropping some serious stats for the games first 12 days out in the world. Most impressive? We’ve contributed to over 2 billion zombie kills in that space of time. See, who’s out there saving the world? We are!</p>



<p>Perhaps if we view Dying Light: The Beast as a zombie apocalypse training ground, these numbers gain some serious context.  While taking out that many zombies, players have only died 169,000 times, so we’re very much on the winning side of things, with a K:D ratio that any Call of Duty player would be proud of. That’s been racked up in an astounding 25.6 million hours of playtime. In less than two weeks. Absolutely mental.</p>
<p>On review duties for TSA, Gamoc awarding Dying Light: The Beast a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/dying-light-the-beast-review/">9/10</a> while saying,”The Beast is the Dying Light sequel I always wanted. It’s dark, literally and tonally, focuses on zombies instead of warring human factions, and expands on some of the more outlandish and interesting ideas hinted at in the original. If this is indicative of what to expect in the franchise going forward, and it certainly looks that way, then I am excited.”</p>
<p>The team at Techland haven’t just sent out their zombie-infested hit to rot either, as we’re already onto patch 1.2, with significant fixes and improvements already in place, bringing more stability, squashing bugs, improving the graphics, balancing some of the weaponry and enemies, and even altering some of the AI behaviour to be more realistic.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a blast, and based on these numbers it’s one that plenty are already on board with. If you’re not there yet, what are you waiting for?</p>
