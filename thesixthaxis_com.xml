		<p>It’s pretty much time to wrap up the year and put a bow on it, in terms of big game releases. There’s still a whole host of ports and remasters to come, and the odd indie delight, like Skate Story or Terminator 2D: No Fate, but I think we can all shift focus to awards season and gearing up for Christmas.</p>
<p>But this week did see that one last big first party game, and I got all ‘roided up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">its review</a>. Metroided up on Prime, that is. With the game, not the fad energy drink, to be clear. I rather enjoyed Samus’ return, and I’m already contemplating doing a second run through!</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been playing Death Howl for a review that you can expect next week, and also got to share <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/outward-2-preview/">his thoughts about Outward 2</a> – “I learned very quickly the world is an unforgiving place. I died so many times!”</p>
<p>While he meant to continue playing Ghost of Yotei, <strong>Ade</strong> just couldn’t keep himself away from Darktide. “It’s just such a fun game, and the fact that you can easily find time to fit a twenty minute mission into a day makes it ideal for when there’s not a lot of free time for gaming.”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> did manage to spend some time in Yotei, though only to cross off a few bounties, before playing something much more chilled with Wingspan, the charming card game about collecting birds that he’d heard good things about.</p>

<p>It’s mainly been Halls of Torment, Lego Horizon, and Where Winds Meet for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, while <strong>Steve</strong> has (as usual) distracted himself from the horrors of the real world with the horrors of digital world, “with the retro-futuristic terrors of Routine and the insomniac delights of Sleep Awake.”</p>
<p>When he hasn’t been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s-wi-fi-7-tri-band-router-review/">fiddling around with Wi-Fi 7 routers</a>, <strong>Dom</strong> has played the chaotic physics-based co-op adventure of Cloudheim, and sunk back into Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">the impressive Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>.</p>
<p>And whaddya know? Bungie managed to lure <strong>Tuffcub</strong> back to Destiny 2 with their Star Wars crossover event. Look out for some thoughts on this a little later today!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

		<p>Cellar Door Games, the studio behind Rogue Legacy and Rogue Legacy 2, has announced its next project, and it is a roguelite tactical RPG called Neath. It is set in a world where the Gods must be obeyed even as they change the rules, while players must lead a group of adventurers through an inverted tower while dealing with monsters and the whims of Fate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neath - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Central to Neath is the lesson that teams need to work together. A main example is the locking system where party members freeze in fear when targeted by an enemy, and the only way to break this is for other members to draw the attention of the foe. As Neath is a roguelike, no run will be exactly the same but you can use resources to build up the town of Shale. Doing so will allow access to different skills that will make runs more manageable and ascendance through the tower more likely. Runs will also have special event encounters that can change up the way things work, as the gods look to keep changing the rules.</p>
<p>No release date has been given for Neath yet, but a demo is expected in 2026. Neath has been confirmed for PC only.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Overnight, Grasshopper Manufacture had its own mini showcase in which it announced that its action game Romeo Is A Dead Man will be released on February 11th. To mark the announcement, a brand new trailer for the game was released, and it is as strange as you would expect from the mind of Suda51 and the team at Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Release Date Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』発売日発表トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ceog9nU0ucs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Romeo Is A Dead Man’s story set up is a bit wild too. Space-time has been shattered and just as Romeo is about to die he is saved by the Dead Gear Life Support System, which turns him into cyborg. He is then recruited to the FBI’s Space-Time Police to hunt down criminals taking advantage of the chaos, while also on a mission to find his girlfriend Juliet. Romeo and Juliet. Get it?</p>
<p>Suda51’s last game was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a>, of which Nick said, “No More Heroes 3 shines with its fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, zany characters and stunningly slick combat. It’s not afraid to be what it is, Suda 51 and his team delivering a great instalment to the franchise that welcomes us to the Garden of Insanity.”</p>

<p>Romeo Is&nbsp; A Dead Man will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
