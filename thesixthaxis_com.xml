		<p>Sports Interactive and SEGA has released a new teaser for Football Manager 26, the next football manager game that will be released after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled earlier this year.</a> This new video gives us a glimpse at some in game footage of the Football Manager 26’s match day experience, including a tease of player walk outs. There is also a focus on the Premier League branding, which has been officially licensed for the new release.</p>

<p>This has been a very bumpy journey for Sports Interactive and its long running Football Manager series. The cancellation of Football Manager 25 was the first time a game in the series had ever been cancelled, and the main reason for this was the shift from the old engine to Unity to provide a more up to date gameplay experience. Football Manager 25 was meant to incorporate women’s football, but it was going to cut &nbsp;Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It is not yet clear if these modes will be in Football Manager 26.</p>
<p>While there is no release date for Football Manager 26 yet, it would be expected to follow previous games in the series and launch at some point in November, so players can play through the 2025/26 season and beyond. Sports Interactive has stated more information will be coming soon about what to expect in Football Manager 26.</p>
