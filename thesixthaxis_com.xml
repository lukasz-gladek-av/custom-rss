		<p>There is a new action RPG coming to town with ChillyRoom announcing Loulan: The Cursed Sand, which is set to come to PC and PS5, though a release date is yet to be set. Players take on the role of a skeletal warrior that has a sand form, which in turn provides some sand based combat powers to take on the various enemies that will be attacking him.</p>

<p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand is set in China along the ancient Silk Road where the lost kingdom of Loulan is located with its ruins piercing the sand. The story focuses on the skeletal warrior, a fallen Royal Guard, who has returned to the fallen kingdom to find his love who is also the princess. The description from the development team about Loulan: The Cursed Sand says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cursed Warrior of Dual Forms:&nbsp;</strong>Control the skeletal warrior “The&nbsp;Cursed Sand”, freely switching between bone and sand forms to experience entirely different combat styles and story interactions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic Melee Combat Against Many:&nbsp;</strong>Engage in grounded, one-against-many melee battles from a dynamic top-down perspective, where terrain design, enemy composition, and combat mechanics intertwine to test your skill and strategy.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Diverse and Creative Sand Abilities:&nbsp;</strong>Learn and wield unique sand abilities to solve puzzles, explore intricate levels, and experiment with multiple combat styles and tactical approaches.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Formidable Elites and Bosses:&nbsp;</strong>Face thrilling one-on-one encounters with powerful elite enemies and colossal bosses that challenge your mastery and reflexes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ancient Western Fantasy World:&nbsp;</strong>Explore a mysterious world inspired by the lost Kingdom of Loulan along the Silk Road, featuring diverse regions and atmospheric, handcrafted levels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ChillyRoom has stated that it is working on planning the localisation of Loulan: The Cursed Sand into different languages, and will have more details when those plans are finalised.</p>
