Using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an example, the company maintains its internal processes are appropriate for handling multiple games, initiatives, and individual milestones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae acknowledged that "talk about legal proceedings" for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as well as its delay, could lead people on the outside to think the company's internal milestone process is being mismanaged. But he'd prefer if investors on the call viewed Krafton's handling of the game in a positive light. According to the CFO, the actions that Krafton has taken on the game (which included dismissing the development leads) "actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to the milestone management."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reasoning behind this, as Bae explained, is that the Subnautica franchise has a large existing player base, and the company is confident that a "certain level of sales" would be guaranteed. Yet, Krafton is seeking to fulfill "the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have," and thus decided on the delay.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-claims-ea-sports-will-become-the-most-valuable-sports-business-in-the-world-" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA CEO claims EA Sports will become the 'most valuable sports business in the world'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we've managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision we made regarding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, because we felt that the game was not up to par, not up to the level that we had wished it to be. So I think that case goes to show that our milestone process is being rigorously managed," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Amidst ">Amidst <span>Subnautica 2</span> drama, Krafton continues its acquisitions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Bae mentioned in passing, the delay of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (from 2025 to early 2026, according to the financial presentation) is far from the biggest news surrounding developer Unknown Worlds' sequel. July kicked off with key leadership </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team">departing the studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A week later, reports alleged that the news of the delay would </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-subnautica-2-is-delayed-potentially-costing-devs-a-250m-bonus-payout">impact a potential $250 million bonus</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the team tied to revenue targets. The next day, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max Macguire, alongside former CEO Ted Gill, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract">filed a lawsuit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> against Krafton.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few days later, a redacted public version of the lawsuit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-krafton-decided-to-go-nuclear-unknown-worlds-founders-claim-subnautica-2-is-being-held-hostage-in-lawsuit">became publicly available</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In it, the three former leaders explained at length how the promise of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "immediate and enormous success," taking the 2.5 million wishlists on Steam as prime reference, would "likely trigger the $250 million earnout to the studio's former owners and employees." This predicament, as the devs claimed, made Krafton "go nuclear" in a bid to delay that success.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-are-not-losing-money-they-re-gaining-less-aheartfulofgames-accuses-parent-company-outright-games-of-mismanagement-ahead-of-purported-closure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton's Changhan Kim told Unknown World leaders that an early access launch would be "disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing" for the publisher. Krafton leadership sent a statement to that tune along to Game Developer, and Bae reinforced this on the call, saying that releasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prematurely with insufficient content would have disappointed the players and damaged the reputations of both the Sunbautica and Unknown Worlds brands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans," the statement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite being in the middle of a legal battle, Krafton went ahead with its latest acquisition on July 25.
