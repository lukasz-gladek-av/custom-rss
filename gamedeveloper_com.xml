In a break from recent tradition, Nintendo showcased only few unique hardware advancements and instead focused on a field it's been historically reluctant to dive into: online multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mysterious "C" button, it turned out, wasn't some button that unlocked magical hardware capabilities, but instead quickly brings players into a feature called "GameChat." GameChat appears to be a slimmed-down version of social platforms like Discord that acts as an all-in-one hub for group multiplayer, video calls, private game streaming, and more, all run through the Nintendo Switch 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the company that rolled out a mobile app to support voice chat on Nintendo Switch has gone all-in on a console-based micro social network.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why would the normally multiplayer-shy Nintendo dive deep into online multiplayer this way? Well in a world where players are asking developers "can I play with my friends?", the company seems to have picked up on a growing game industry trend: a future where players—especially younger ones—want to play together at all times.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo thinks it can finally make &quot;safe&quot; online spaces">Nintendo thinks it can finally make "safe" online spaces</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a follow-up presentation at a media event held during the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser seemed to tip the company's hand as to why it seems to have finally committed resources to robust online features. He spoke of how players of all ages can now "safely connect" and play games with friends and family.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Safety" has been the watchword for Nintendo's hesitance to jump feet-first into online play. The company has long prioritized family-friendly games, building an audience of young players that isn't as present on competitors like the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Unfortunately as platforms like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">Roblox have demonstrated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the slightest flaw in content and player moderation can expose children to dangerous situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wired's Megan Farokhmanesh pressed the company on this topic in a roundtable Q&amp;A during Nintendo's preview event. Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta explained GameChat is an online system built around the Nintendo Friends list instead of random game lobbies. Parents monitoring their children's online activity through the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/parental-controls/">parental control app</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be able to personally approve any friend requests they receive, reducing the odds of encountering a stranger in the wild.

"So we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's an experience many players had in the pandemic, to the point that much has been made about how young players spend their time in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/roblox-devs-say-socialization-is-what-makes-the-creator-led-sandbox-tick">Roblox</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hanging out and goofing around.

Unexpectedly, it's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In hands-on time with the game at the preview event, players had the opportunity to drive around a large open world that hosted elements of the game's many tracks. It was only after I saw a few of the other 24 players driving </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>across</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the track I was zooming on that I realized I could go off course, and the experience revealed a fun open lobby perfect for players to goof around in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the Nintendo Direct, the company explained that the open world won't just be an empty sandbox, but an area filled with opportunities for exploration. It was easy to imagine friends logging in not to race, but to just drive around and play bumper cars.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Online multiplayer is a big business opportunity">Online multiplayer is a big business opportunity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Look, let's get brass tacks about all this, with a socially-designed Switch 2, Nintendo can cash in big time on multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gating communication behind a Nintendo Switch Online subscription? $20 a year. Adding in the expansion pack? $50 a year. The most they charge for online play is $80 a year for a full family plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those prices are low compared to subscription plans on Xbox and PlayStation, but up until this point its offerings were relatively light. A robust suite of social tools is more likely to convince a bunch of dedicated Switch users to make the jump.</span></p><p>Image via System Era Softworks/Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 also now has a clear hardware feature that sets ahead of other handhelds. To set up comparable multiplayer services on say, an ROG Ally, players need to download an app like Discord and calibrate it to fit with their playstyle before they can chat with friends. With the Nintendo Switch 2, players can start talking with the push of a button.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the mysterious but ever-present concept of "brand loyalty." Nintendo isn't short on loyal players, but its scaled-back social systems have created an exit vector for players to leave its ecosystem. Now, in a very Apple-like fashion, Nintendo can support voice chat and screen sharing without pushing users to another service (and with the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, it can also eliminate the need to buy non-Nintendo hardware).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The runaway success of the Nintendo Switch certainly raised expectations for the Switch 2's sales performance. While the multiplayer tools themselves may not propel the system to over 150 million units sold in its lifetime (Switch 2 exclusive </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Duskbloods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do a lot of heavy lifting), it sets the table for more monetization opportunities down the line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However the Switch 2 performs, its multiplayer-centric hardware shows Nintendo is keeping an eye on changing trends. Multiplayer has long been a domain into which Nintendo barely treads, so its choice to go all-in on the technology—especially in lieu of drastically new physical hardware features—signals the weight of its strategic shift.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
