Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable. However, our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with. With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Miyamoto refused to make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing because "everyone has different interests," but said it's important to explore concepts that feel distinct.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product–and repeat this process over and over again," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's advice that's probably easier to follow if you're a company with Nintendo's resources, but Miyamoto suggested it's absolutely possible to create fun games with small teams and tight budgets, and implored developers "not to lose sight of this perspective."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo corporate director Ko Shiota echoed that sentiment and suggested streamlining development around the Switch has been fundamental to the company's recent success. "From a hardware and system perspective, we believe it is important to provide an environment that enables game developers to work efficiently," added Shiota.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As explained in today's presentation, the merging of home consoles and handheld systems allowed us to integrate what previously were two separate software development environments. Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shiota reiterated that new ideas are priceless and have no relation to the size of a studio's wallet. "Bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas, so we hope to continue to focus on a process where teams of hardware an and software developers share ideas to create interesting things," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo recently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-lowers-fiscal-forecast-with-switch-hardware-and-software-in-decline">lowered its fiscal forecast with Switch hardware and software sales in decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the console has delivered a mammoth innings with lifetime sales currently standing at over 146 million units worldwide.
