Its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://embracer.com/summary/interim-report-q2-fy-24-25/#press-release">interim report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows the Entertainment/Services and Games divisions—and the latter's individual PC/Console, tabletop, and mobile sub-segments—had downturns across the board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC/Console games had the biggest decline: net sales fell to 2.12 billion SEK ($193.2 million), down 46 percent year-over-year. CEO Lars Wingefors contributed that decline to the lack of new releases: whereas 2023-2024's second quarter had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remnant II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the 2024-2025 quarter mainly saw a re-release of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the 1.0 launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wingefors, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "slower than expected" digital sales, despite its positive reception, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reportedly performed above expectations and saw a "solid inflow" of new players. The Entertainment/Services division also had a sizable tumble of 35 percent, which was attributed to "few new releases."</span></p><p>Embracer cited 'few new releases' as reason for declines in its PC/Console game sub-segment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mobile games had less of a fall at 1.36 billion SEK ($123.9 million) in net sales, which translates to a roughly 8 percent decline compared to 2023-2024's Q2. Wingefors believes the improved market conditions that drove player activity and improved revenue growth for this quarter will continue through the fiscal year's second half.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the interim report, Wingefors also commented on Embracer's recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-divests-mobile-studio-easybrain-in-1-2-billion-deal">$1.2 billion sale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of mobile developer Easybrain, which he hopes will "put us in a much stronger position to drive value, both in the short- and long-term."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a 5 percent dip in net sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-embracer-coo-asmodee-should-be-great-at-handling-900-million-debt">Asmodee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (or the tabletop sub-segment) was commended for having a "strong execution" between July and September. Asmodee's decrease in publishing partners was said to be balanced out by a growth in the games published during the quarter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Embracer expects growth in earnings for Entertainment/Services during the third quarter, along with lower earnings for the larger 2024-2025 fiscal year. Growth in the Entertainment division is expected to come from the Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim anime film, which arrives on December 13.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the losses, that can be owed to adjusted expectations for the first half of the fiscal year, and several PC/Console games that have already been (or are expected to be) delayed, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
