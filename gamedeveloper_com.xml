This is the first part of a three-part series on combat-focused game balance design, exploring its evolution and showcasing successful case studies to illustrate key concepts and techniques.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As multiplayer gaming revenues continue to grow, recent research reveals that 47% of studios struggle to analyze and respond to the overwhelming volume of player feedback. In mobile games, nearly half of in-app purchases consist of currencies, which are deeply integrated into both the in-game economy and core gameplay. This raises a crucial question: how can developers effectively balance these increasingly complex multiplayer ecosystems to deliver the best possible player experience? Let’s shed some light on this topic, often seen as either black magic reserved for the initiated or the end product of years of brute force and trial-and-error — something we've witnessed even in well-funded triple-A games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Until 2010, while working as a contract-based Game Balance Designer for EA Los Angeles' RTS (real-time strategy) games division, I had the opportunity to lead balance patch development for some of their most renowned titles, like Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth I &amp; II, and in the pre-production phases of Command and Conquer 3 and 4. Those were exciting times, where I introduced what I called the 'Battletest system'. The system has two stages, first it focuses on on gathering feedback from controlled tests involving top players across the game's various factions. Then the balance designer combines statistical analysis with the good old 'gut feeling' to rapidly iterate patches and fine-tune these complex games to a fine state of perceived balance.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How it started">How it started</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I began working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME1) patch 1.03 as a collaborator, with no guarantee it would ever see an official release. EA’s strict review and approval process made patching expensive — around $50k per patch. Not a small investment for a game that had already launched, especially with another title in development, burning through its own budget. There were also concerns within the studio that relying on top players' feedback might lead to a gameplay style that could alienate lower-skilled players, who formed the basis of the player pyramid. I argued that top players were the ones being followed, setting trends and actually creating the optimal strategies, which would naturally trickle down to the broader player population over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On gamereplays.org and other public forums, top players began openly praising and promoting the private "battletest" modded versions they had been testing in pre-arranged sessions, and were later released publicly as mods. To our team's surprise, EA embraced the project and decided to turn it into an official patch — something unprecedented at the time. After a month of rigorous back-and-forth with their internal and external QA teams, BfME patch 1.03 was officially released in February 25, 2006 to widespread acclaim. As anticipated, the strategies developed by the top players during the patch's creation took months for the general player base to master, leading to an unusually long period of balance stability. And let's be honest — high-skill players tend to be the most vocal and influential in the community, for good reason. When they praise a game’s balance, it's hard to argue against.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The second step is not always easier">The second step is not always easier</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next came </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME2), which posed an extreme challenge in terms of balance. With its six unique factions and over 1,600 unique data entries, balancing the game manually was practically impossible. To do it on time and within budget, I developed a specialized tool—the Battle Stats Reference (BSR) automated spreadsheet. Bear in mind, this was during an era when Excel reigned supreme, and there were no cloud-based alternatives. So I taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and, within two months, completed version two of BSR just in time for the actual battletest game sessions. While opening the spreadsheet on a modern (2021) version of Excel “kinda works,” some features — like the original floating control bar — no longer function properly. You can, however, see a screenshot of it in its full original glory below:</span></p><p>[[ BSR v2 Screenshot ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BSR managed the multiple "ini" data files used by EA's proprietary SAGE engine through separate, cross-referenced sheets. It could seamlessly import and export game data to and from these sheets without breaking internal data connections. This capability enabled rapid comparison and bulk editing of game parameters, leading to a tenfold increase in productivity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding efficiency is not very efficient">Finding efficiency is not very efficient</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply editing and inputting numbers into the game wasn’t enough to achieve an initial raw-balanced version. I needed a solid (guess what?) strategy. My approach involved running a series of synthetic tests with two networked machines, each using different sets of units with roughly the same total cost, battling it out. I also defined a "base" or reference unit for each class, like the Rohan Rohirrim for cavalry and the Elven Lorien Archer for ranged units. By balancing these base units against each other, I could extend the results to other units within the same class, provided they were "internally balanced". Internal balance is accomplished among different units within the same class, and it requires a separate, later balancing pass. The real challenge was crafting an "efficiency" formula to distill a unit's battlefield effectiveness into a single number. Not only is there no standard formula for this somewhat subjective parameter, but RTS games also feature a wide variety of classes from swordsmen to pikemen and heroes, with tens or even hundreds of attributes for each unit type. Last but not least, factors like build time, movement speed, and weapon range each have different weights for efficiency, depending on the game's economy, map scale, and pace. At the end of the day, as with most complex systems, the key was to observe the synthetic game tests and back-fit an equation to match reality. And this led to the creation of this monstrous formula:</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">0.001 * [ DPS * (Range/160+(1/Range+1)) * Sqrt(60 / buildtime) * ((health*hordesize*(100/armor))/100) * (Arctan((speed/12)-4)+1.4)+speed/40)^2) ] / [ (cost^0.3)/10 ]</span></pre><p>[[ Efficiency Calculation for BfME 2 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The formula didn’t start out that complex, of course. Initially, drawing from my own in-game experience, I prioritized range and speed as the key parameters for efficiency. Gradually, I compiled results from the synthetic tests into a separate chart and refined the formula to match those results as closely as possible, much like creating a trendline in a spreadsheet. Once the formula was reasonably aligned with the ninety-or-so base unit test results, I compiled the first patch version and shared it with our VIP testers. The formula continued to evolve based on feedback from those incredibly high-skill matches. Remember, tournaments weren’t as common back then, so top players rarely faced each other; their main goal was climbing the quickmatch ranks and avoiding tough matches that could hurt their ratings. Still, after venting out for so long about the weaknesses and imbalances in their favorite factions, these players were eager to give their all with a new, improved, and (temporarily) exclusive patch. I even created the "Palantir" series of videos to showcase some of the best moments from those intense, close games. You can watch one of them here:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBUrBjYg8og" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[[ BFME Patch 1.03 - "Palantir" Episode III ]]</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Great success!">Great success!</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BfME 1.03 and BfME2 1.05 were met with an enormously positive reception and marked the last official patches released for those games. The community was so pleased that many players advocated that no further balance patches were needed. That's a testament to the incredible work done with the help of a dedicated group of players from around the world — many of whom leveraged their well-deserved recognition to kickstart their careers in the games industry, such as HERO (Larry King), prepare (Jan Richter), and James Fielding. I also want to give a special shoutout to Aaron Kaufman, "the" community manager, who championed the community leads within the studio and made all of this possible. And yes, he even flew us out to Los Angeles for some unforgettable "in-person battletests"! Amazing times.</span></p><p>[[ One of the many in-person battletest teams, that one for C&amp;C4 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next article, we’ll explore how real-time combat game balance design evolved throughout the late 2010s and how cloud-based solutions literally changed the game. The third and final installment will delve into how F2P mobile gaming introduced yet another layer of complexity to this critical and ever-evolving aspect of game design. Comments and suggestions are always welcome, of course. Cheers!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For many, Musk's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5156184/elon-musk-trump-election-x-twitter">support</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of US president-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 election was the last straw.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bluesky seems to be pulling ahead in the "Twitter replacement" wars ahead of platforms like Mastodon and Threads, largely because it recreates the functionality of Twitter pre-Musk takeover. Its main differentiators are the ability for users to build their own Bluesky servers if they so desire, and a suite of moderation tools that make it easier for users to ward off toxic behavior. For instance, if you block someone on Bluesky, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>you block them in real life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> both parties are unable to view each other's posts, and any posts from the blocked user interacting with the blocker are rendered invisible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also "Starter Packs," user-created recommendation groups of accounts that let users easily find accounts they might want to follow. Developer Linsey Raymaekers was so enthusiastic about this feature she made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://linseyray.notion.site/BlueSky-GameDev-Starter-Packs-12721c74d80380b8ba81d95d01c8d9d6">a public Notion page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> documenting high-profile game developer Starter Packs for developers across different disciplines and regions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But are there other reasons for making the jump? Is the platform restoring an old sense of community or ability to get the word out about your game? We checked in with game developers on the platform to get their feedback—and see if it's truly a network developers can rely on.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Twitter engagement was declining after Musk's takeover">Twitter engagement was declining after Musk's takeover</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple developers we spoke with agreed—even beyond disagreeing with how Musk ran the site, Twitter just wasn't giving them what they needed anymore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Veelpoot creative director and founder (and former senior narrative designer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Avengers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games) Keano Raubun told Game Developer he used to have "high engagement and growth" on the platform before Musk took over. "From a game marketing perspective, it just made sense to look for alternatives," he said. "Also I'm too old for TikTok."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While some users on the site formerly known as Twitter were seeing less engagement, others were making more—off of anger and toxicity. Game designer Monica Fan said they were one of many developers from a marginalized background who saw extreme posts spread further and further, and they started looking for an exit. "The hate is different when it's not [driven] by personal opinion, but rather as a way to make money," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>everyone</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who responded to us expressed relief at being so removed from hateful posts and users that had dominated X since 2022 (and were often elevated by Musk, sometimes directing harassment toward developers). Plenty of developers faced abuse on the basis of their race, gender, or sexuality. Brass Lion Entertainment design director Osama Dorias told us that among other issues, the tolerance for racism and sexism is what sent him looking for alternative platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">X's policy of training the generative AI LLM "Grok" off of X posts also sent some users away. Bluesky has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297442/bluesky-no-intention-train-generative-ai-posts">explicitly stated it won't train any AI </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">tools off of what users post ("knowing my stupid posts would be used to help </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/23/1092777/ai-is-an-energy-hog-this-is-what-it-means-for-climate-change/">kill the earth directly</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was too much," quipped technical producer Shayna Moon).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several developers we spoke with said they appreciated a "shift in tone" they've seen on Bluesky—not just from a lower population of rage-baiting accounts, but also a more relaxed sense of posting from their peers. Kitfox Games founder Tanya Short said she assumes it "won't last" if the population keeps growing, but she nodded to the platform's butterfly logo and said the site's operators seem to be interested in promoting "easy-going vibes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bluesky.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nina Freeman—an indie developer pulling double duty on Dontnod's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> said she initially made an account just to grab the handle, aware that she would need some social media to market her games. "Since I don't typically work with a publisher, I have to do all my own marketing. So maintaining some social media presence is important." She said her main focus is on Twitch, but moving to Bluesky helped her "reconnect" with fellow developers after a long break from social media. "It's fun to see more and more familiar names popping up in this new space."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For some folks, it's a fresh start. The increasingly harsh environment on Twitter (which existed before Musk's takeover) sent some developers away from the platform, including Dave Kosak, former </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> narrative and quest lead who struggled with online harassment after the California lawsuit against Activision Blizzard. He said Bluesky's "nuclear block" tool has helped him feel reconnecting with the game development community. With "block lists" also built into the platform as feeds that can be subscribed too, it makes it easier to identify larger groups of users you may not want to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The business case is building too. Aster Wright pinged us to let us know indie developer/publisher </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-finji-ceo-bekah-saltsman-would-update-about-her-gdc-talk-on-indie-pitching">Finji</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is setting up social account for games on the platform, because it's already seeing growth and engagement and connecting with players. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter packs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and custom feeds are also helping them find a non-professional audience and be found by others. Polygon Treehouse creative director Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou seconded this, saying he's already seeing better engagement from posts on Bluesky about the studio's upcoming game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythwrecked</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> than on other platforms. Riot Games social media manager Eric Aaberg said he's "testing the waters" for seeing if Valorant's esports fandom will gather in the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plane Toast creative director Émi Lefèvre said her team set up a "brand account" relatively early because the platform was quickly becoming a "legitimate" place to share projects. "For now, I'd say it's a great platform to share early development and get early feedback from kind people," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the lack of an "algorithm" that recommends posts to your main feed a good or a bad thing? The answers were mostly positive—custom feeds let developers aggregate who they want to see more easily, and not trying to "game" the algorithm shifts how people post. Some raised the point that no algorithm means it's harder to have your game passively recommended to other users, which will affect the platform's viability as a tool for talking to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developer Robert Yang pointed out that so far, Bluesky isn't suppressing visibility on links off the platform, making it more likely his followers will see it when he links to his work. "Even when there were only like 5 people on Bluesky, that was already 5 more people than Twitter would let me reach," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some developers like Neha Patel were late arrivals because they felt they needed to focus on other platforms like X to have any shot at a career. Fewer resources in the industry for marginalized developers meant she and others didn't have the privilege to withdraw from a major platform for networking and marketing her work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaving was going to have a high cost, so seeing a "fun" audience helped soften the blow for her. She said it's the most fun she's ever had on a social media account.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There's always a storm on the horizon">There's always a storm on the horizon</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some folks we've spoken with—especially those who saw Bluesky in its earlier, rougher days—voiced some caution at viewing the platform as a panacea to X's hostility. Earlier in its lifetime, the site struggled with moderation and seemed to signal it wanted users to moderate their own communities. That changed after Black users reported an uptick in hostility, with one high-profile incident being an account with a slur in its name that seemed to slip by the automated moderation tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Katherine Cross (who occasionally contributes to Game Developer) closely analyzed the state of Bluesky and warned in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-twitter-social-media/">2023 Wired column</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that its professed moderation strategy might put a ceiling on organic connections between communities. "If Bluesky lives up to its promises, the various and sundry right-wing 'culture warriors' and other crypto-fascists might find themselves behind a permanent block that cannot be undone by corporate chicanery," she wrote. "But those same mechanisms will also, of necessity, put up barriers between diverse communities...making it impossible to recreate Twitter’s serendipity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ivy Road animation lead "Aura" (a longtime Twitter user whose posts regularly exploded in virality) pointed out that what developers want out of Bluesky—what she described as the vibe of "Twitter circa 2019"—could lead to X's flaws being born again. "2019 Twitter was already in a place where I had to watch I said very carefully, and that's very true of Bluesky as well. This is the only site where random things I say consistently get picked up by the media, and it means I have to be very cautious that even casual comments might become news."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bluesky.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, Twitter's network effect and the regular instance of tweets blowing up and driving "dunk-quoting" is a phenomenon that Bluesky sometimes enables. Tools limiting who can quote your posts help, but the network effect Aura is referring to is created by the nature of the site. Many of these safety tools, however, only came to be after users like political commentator Jamelle Bouie briefly decamped from Bluesky, tired of being swarmed by users ready to fight over every kind of post.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also a question of what developers will do if their core communities outside of the Western game development industry still live on other platforms. Fan said they're still maintaining a presence on X because Asian game developers haven't begun to make the jump, and indie Shawn Alexander Allen explained he wouldn't be permanently setting up camp as long as the indie/underground rap community is still a thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the general frustration that developers need to be on platforms like Bluesky in the first place. "We were taught in school that if we ever want to get a job in the industry we need to be 'Twitter famous,' Fan said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Freeman agreed, saying "I don't like that it feels almost essential to work with a publisher or a bigger platform to get the visibility you need...even within just the indie space, never mind the mainstream."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BlueSky's AT protocol may mean the communication method itself isn't controlled by one company, but the easy-to-use app is, and that may leave it vulnerable to the same kind of takeover that befell X, as Lefèvre pointed out. "I still have a bitter feeling about it as this is still a centralized platform owned by a corporation and we'll never be safe from someone taking over," she said. "I wish people would give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.social/explore">Mastodon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a try but right now it's still lagging behind unfortunately!"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What's next for game developers on Bluesky?">What's next for game developers on Bluesky?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: The Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> narrative director Ashley Ruhl said she hopes Bluesky can be a place where indie and solo developers can be "elevated," praising the "Starter Pack" system with helping her broaden the kinds of developers she connects with. System Era design director Liz England echoed this sentiment, saying she hopes the platform can revitalize one of Twitter's best strengths, erasing walls between new and aspiring developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers said to help market games on the platform, they still need better media uploading tools and access to back-end analytics. The only gifs you can post right now are ones that exist in Tenor, and the odds of a high-quality gif of your game going viral aren't very high at the moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key metric to watch out for will be if Bluesky attracts sports fans, as community manager Casey Lucas pointed out. "The demolition of chronological feeds has frustrated sports fans a lot. People like to live-tweet along with a game, interact about games/tournaments using hashtags, build communities of fellow fans, especially if they live outside the geographic area where their favorite team or sport is located," she explained. "I suspected Twitter was on the outs for good when the combination of algorithmic feed and political force-feeding got so bad it started to annoy hockey and football fans."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Across all the followers who wrote into us though, there was a universal theme: everyone wants Bluesky to be a safer, calmer, and more encouraging space for their community. Everyone seems tired of the confrontational type of posting that took place on X, which made directing harassment at other users feel like a fun game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, there's at least a brief moment of joy of having an online space that doesn't cater to white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. It will take careful work by Bluesky management—and a concerted effort by users—to keep it that way.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
