"This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a statement sent to Game Developer, an IWGB spokesperson said Rockstar is attempting to "deflect" from the truth and remains afraid of "hard working staff privately discussing and exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Management are showing they don't care about delays to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and that they're prioritizing union busting by targeting the very people who make the game," they added. "In recent years, Rockstar executives have benefited from £443 million in tax relief, while showing total disregard for the law or the livelihoods of their staff. At every turn, they've chosen profits over both workers and fans of their games."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-says-increase-in-new-games-will-put-ai-driven-discovery-tools-at-the-forefront" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity CEO: AI-driven tools will improve game discoverability</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, the IWGB said UK workers have a statutory right to engage in private conversation with union organizers that supersedes any employment contract.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those discussions took place via a private Discord channel that all of the fired workers had joined.
