"By collaborating with BDAN and Busan City, we aim to create opportunities for local talent and businesses while contributing to the economic and technological growth of the region."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, Xsolla's Busan plans do not appear to have a timetable for turning the city into a prominent game development hub. For both Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia, the commerce company explicitly stated it wanted those countries' development academies to create new jobs or be a prospective location for the larger game industry by 2030.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, this deal with Xsolla is said to "demonstrate Busan’s potential to become a global leader in the gaming and digital industries," according to mayor Park Hyung-Joon.
