Those working in upper management (47 percent), for example, used AI tools more than those in the lower decks (29 percent). Studio directors sit between those two groups (36 percent).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">21 percent of respondents said they use internal generative AI tools—although that metric increased to 30 percent for workers at triple-A studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-nintendo-switch-2-has-topped-17-million-sales-worldwide" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Nintendo Switch 2 has topped 17 million sales worldwide</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Large language models (LLMs) were the most used AI tool by a country mile.

Several respondents also disclosed the use of Claude, a LLM that was not included in this year's survey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what are developers using those AI tools for? According to the survey, 81 percent of respondents use them for research or brainstorming, while 47 percent leverage them to complete daily tasks such as writing emails and code assistance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The data indicates generative AI tools are used less for creative tasks such as asset generation (19 percent), procedural generation (10 percent), and player-facing features (5 percent).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Men also reported using generative AI tools more than women (41 percent compared to 35 percent), while older workers appear to be more reliant on the tech than their younger counterparts (46 percent compared to 34 percent).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="52 percent of professionals think generative AI is having a negative impact on the industry">52 percent of professionals think generative AI is having a negative impact on the industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai">seemingly failed to warm to generative AI tools in 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with some suggesting the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">technology would lower the quality of video games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, according to the 2025 State of the Game Industry report, 30 percent of respondents felt generative AI would have a negative impact on the game industry (an increase from 18 percent in 2024).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft union representatives call for resignation of CEO Yves Guillemot</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That figure has once again shot up.
