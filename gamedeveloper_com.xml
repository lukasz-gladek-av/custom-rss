Through the simple act of taking a photo, photography games and photo modes implore us to notice our surroundings, document our experience, and take a moment to commit to memory the images and emotions that we felt along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To better explore those connections and mechanics, Game Developer is publishing a series of new articles digging into the topic, and highlighting some classics as well. Come along with us as we take a look at the history of photography in video games and its popular uses within the genre and preview the new interviews, essays, and deep dives publishing in the days to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll be highlighting reader-submitted articles throughout the week and there’s tons of great stuff to look forward to, like an essay from Beasts of Maravilla Island developer Michelle Olson about eschewing photographic critique, an interview with the developers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre on why they went with the free release of an idyllic photography minigame as a prequel to their horror title, and a poignant feature from our senior editor Bryant Francis on what basic photography tips can teach us about making better photo modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll also be revisiting interviews, blogs and features from Game Developer’s recent past, unearthing postmortems from games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-sundae-month-s-pupperazzi">Pupperazzi</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-toem">TOEM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-some-indies-are-approaching-photography-mechanics-in-their-games">interviews with indie developers about how they’re using photography in video games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Stay tuned for insight on how these games are put together and the features that developers find vital to the photography game experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If this topic fascinates you, there’s still time to submit an article to our blog section about photography games and photo modes in video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take a peek at our blog submission guidelines and FAQ, head over to our blog submission page and send us your thoughts.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And his grand ambition is for his&nbsp;company to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;gateway studio for newer talent.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=259421">Bahamut</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (spotted by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/15182-final-fantasy-xv-director-hajime-tabata-talks-leaving-square-enix-those-cancelled-dlcs">RPGSite</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) at a recent Taiwanese game event, Tabata explained his desire to bring in young staff, particularly those outside of Japan. He also wants to JP to recreate his experience of working with&nbsp;international developers back when he was&nbsp;at Square Enix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Final Fantasy] created opportunities for me to get to know game creators from not only Taiwan but the whole Asian region,"&nbsp;he explained. "I have a strong desire to create new games with these young Asian people."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tabata acknowledged that doing so wasn't entirely possible at Square Enix prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-final-fantasy-xv-i-game-director-hajime-tabata-departs-square-enix">his leaving in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which in turn spurred him to going independent. Things at the studio appear to have changed, since&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is headed up by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-i-kept-most-of-its-predecessor-s-development-team">Naoki Hamaguchi</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in his first sole director role at the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that he's running his own studio, Tabata's aimed to "create a team with freedom"&nbsp;before making an RPG with a similar mindset. While he'll be using his previous Square Enix experience, he wants to make games in a different way from his youth, in turn evolving the genre.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The RPG is a genre with a great potential," he noted. "I also had a desire to create a development team with more freedom, and it feels like people that share the same thought gradually gathered here."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tabata wants his studio&nbsp;to help&nbsp;restore his developer status">Tabata wants his studio&nbsp;to help&nbsp;restore his developer status</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">JP Games is currently at work on an MMO-like project and a console RPG co-developed with another company. It's also at work on middleware dubbed the Pegasus World Kit, which has tools specifically to help with developing RPGs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By Tabata's accounts, there's a greater sense of freedom there than what was afforded in working on&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XV.&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to that game and its development, he explained that there were&nbsp;"different policies"&nbsp;with Square management at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As it "felt impossible"&nbsp;to work under those conditions, he left, which later resulted in three&nbsp;previously announced&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XV&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">expansions being canceled.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[That]&nbsp;wasn't my decision to make, but I couldn't stop it, which made me even more depressed at the time,"&nbsp;Tabata admitted. "However, the sense of frustration that I felt gave me the motivation to produce better games from a freer standpoint."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">JP lets him take on "new challenges,"&nbsp;and he thinks it can redeem his name, along with other&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XV&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">veterans who joined him.
