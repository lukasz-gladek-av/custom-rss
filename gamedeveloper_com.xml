Game Developer can now confirm that show organizers are not planning a new Future Class for 2025, and are not planning any programming for future or past honorees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This information was provided to Future Class alumni in a Discord server established to host networking and mentorship opportunities for the program. Previous honorees (some of whom requested anonymity for fear of retaliation) told Game Developer this update was the only message they've received from show management in the last year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Last year we completed our promised cycle of programming for the 2023 FC with our TGA mixer, and did not induct a new Future Class," said Future Class organizer Emily Weir. "At this time, we are not planning a new Future Class for this year and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Weir said the organization will keep the Discord server online for alumni to stay in touch with each other, but said she and Keighley are not actively monitoring the server.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/book-excerpt-the-game-needs-to-change-towards-sustainable-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: The Game Needs to Change: Towards Sustainable Game Design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards has also removed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thegameawards.com/future-class">the Future Class page on its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, eliminating the definitive record of previous honorees. The 2023 cohort </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">is not named on the program's Medium page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (this may be an oversight, organizers did update the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43570315-The-Game-Awards-Future-Class/">Game Awards Future Class Steam Curator page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with games from the most recent class).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Future Class honorees say they feel &quot;neglected&quot;">Former Future Class honorees say they feel "neglected"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game writer and 2023 honoree (and former Game Developer contributor) Emma Kidwell explained to Game Developer that she repeatedly tagged Weir and Keighley in messages this year asking for updates on the program, only to receive no response. "I felt disrespected as someone who has spoken with Emily in person," she said. "It makes everything feel disingenuous and it sounds and feels like they want us to go away quietly. I know not everyone in the Future Class Discord feels like this, but what do they expect from a group of hurt marginalized folks?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kidwell was one of the honorees </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/dT2t3gJcBiI?si=rs06tdviVODBjfUj">spotlighted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that year's broadcast. Fellow writer and cohort member Anna Webster concurred, saying she wished the organization was "up front" about the state of the program. She said a 2024 networking event before that year's Awards now feels like it was "a last hoorah."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-wizards-of-the-coast-exec-resurrects-canceled-game-at-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Wizards of the Coast exec resurrects canceled game at new studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Malek Teffaha, who was recognized by the group in 2022, told Game Developer that the news "honestly hurt." "I, among others, thought that the Future Class program was not just a platform for celebration, but a means to bridge the gap between industry workers and leaders and help shape the future of the game industry."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm disappointed, but not surprised," said JC Lau, another 2022 alumni. When asked if she felt supported by the organization after organizers said they would determine the program's "next steps" after the 2024 show, she replied "how could they have supported us in the last year if they literally had no contact with us at all?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These sentiments were shared by other anonymous former honorees who spoke with Game Developer, one of whom called Weir's statement "minimal and evasive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards faced internal pressure from Future Class members from 2023 into 2024 on two fronts. Honorees called on Keighley to use the show as an opportunity call for a ceasefire as Israel mounted its invasion of the Gaza Strip following Hamas' October 7 attacks (a United Nations commission described the invasion as "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166201">genocidal</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" in an October 2025 report).
