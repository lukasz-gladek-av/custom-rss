For now, our dev-budgets are in the $30k-$100k sort of range, but we strive to be as flexible as possible on this front," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pantaloon.io/label-terms">reads an explainer on the Pantaloon website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Pantaloon isn't handcuffed to a genre. We do look for a theme, however. An aesthetic. An intangible offbeat quality that simply makes your game bizarre. We want to explore uncharted genre-waters and find new combinations of systems that haven’t been brought together before."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label will typically offer a 70/30 revenue split in favor of developers but is prepared to take a smaller cut. Developers who sign with Pantaloon will retain full ownership of their IP and won't be locked into a contract thanks to the use of open termination clauses. In addition, Pantaloon explained it will never force a recoup upon its partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company hopes those terms will "restore the broken power balance in the indie publishing world."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pantaloon's publishing slate currently includes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sub-Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from New Zealand-based developer Interactive Tragedy and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Occlude</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from UK studio Tributary Games.
