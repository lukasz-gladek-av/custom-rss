Not least because the deal is being partly financed with a $20 billion debt package from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. The remaining $36 billion is being put up in cash by EA's new private owners.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-30/jpmorgan-ea-buyout-debt-is-getting-some-private-credit-help">As Bloomberg noted this week</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, taking on that much debt will be risky for EA, so how is the publisher looking to reassure its workforce that the future remains bright? For starters, the company said "there will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That statement was in response to a very simple question: Will private ownership lead to layoffs?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear what "immediate" means in this context, but it's a word that doesn't offer long-term guarantees. EA, however, insisted it will need "world class teams" to expand its global reach and drive innovation as a private company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It remains to be seen how those teams will shape up once the deal closes in what EA estimates will be around "six to nine months."
