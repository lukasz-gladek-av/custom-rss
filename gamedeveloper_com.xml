It's a milestone indie developer Nuggets Entertainment said was difficult to fathom, but one that has been hugely inspiring for the team.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further afield, we recently stopped for a brief chat with some local developers at the bustling Thai Games pavilion at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show. During a quick conversation with a young indie, we noticed we were being filmed by somebody nearby. Eventually, they interrupted our conversation to explain "I'm his mum, and I'm so proud!" It was a small, deeply human moment that reminded me there is still plenty to love about this industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Admittedly, there is also plenty to condemn—including the layoffs and questionable corporate posturing that continued with aplomb this week.

Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto told Game File that he found the DHS/ICE post “absolutely abhorrent" and said knocked him "sick" to see the series co-opted in that way. Jaime Griesemer, who was a chief designer on early Halo titles, said they found the post depicting Trump as Master Chief rather amusing, but said the ICE post was beyond the pale. "Using Halo imagery in a call to 'destroy' people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation," they added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Possessor(s) dev Heart Machine lays off more staff two weeks before the game's launch</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="GDC Festival of Gaming: The industry reacts to the controversial rebrand"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-festival-of-gaming-the-industry-reacts-to-the-controversial-rebrand">GDC Festival of Gaming: The industry reacts to the controversial rebrand</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via GamesIndustry.biz //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Our sibling organization's major rebrand has set the world of game development abuzz, and this roundup of replies from our&nbsp;peers at&nbsp;GI.biz&nbsp;shines a light on the concerns of the international development community.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="NetEase accused of lifting art for Marvel Rivals' Wakanda map"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/netease-accused-of-copying-art-for-marvel-rivals-wakanda-map">NetEase accused of lifting art for Marvel Rivals' Wakanda map</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The former lead environment artist of EA's canceled Black Panther game made a compelling case that NetEase "borrowed" elements of his portfolio for the art direction of Marvel Rivals.
