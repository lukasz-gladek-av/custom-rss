Developers do not need to disclose if they used "AI powered tools" (like code helper software) used for workflow purposes, but they do need to list any use of "AI to generate content for the game" and/or "AI content generated during gameplay." Essentially, if any generative AI content makes it into the game or the game's associated materials, developers will need to disclose it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When AI is used to create content, Valve says this disclosure counts for the game itself alongside associated material like marketing assets or the store page. Developers must fill out a text box detailing their use of the tools. For AI content generated during gameplay, developers must check a box if the game itself makes AI-generated images, text, or other content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Carless notes, the directives were significantly rewritten, presumably to offer more clarity for developers.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

The studio's upcoming title, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, remains in development after the move and will still be published by Netflix.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What, though, goes into buying back an established studio from a sprawling conglomerate? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://spryfox.com/a-16-year-old-baby-is-born-miracles-do-happen/">In a new blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Edery described the move as a "big bet" and said the team had to make some sacrifices in order to regain their independence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All of us are taking large pay cuts. Daniel and I have reduced our salaries to $20,000/year, and we've spent our own cash to buy the studio back,' he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And we are taking all the equity in the new company and giving the majority of it to the rest of the studio’s employees. In a world where executives tend to make 10x the salaries that employees do, and have 100x the equity, we want Spry Fox to be an example of something fairer and hopefully much better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edery explained the spinout from Netflix came together in around three months, which he described as "extremely fast."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To put this in perspective, a spinout of this magnitude would typically take 6 to 9 months. So we’ve been sprinting to disentangle ourselves. It has been a LOT of work," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/understanding-interim-relief-in-context-of-iwgb-s-fight-against-rockstar" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why would a UK judge deny fired Rockstar workers interim relief?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Those headaches aside, we are so thankful. For the past three years, the game industry has been such a bleak place. Countless companies have shut down, including some truly great studios that made history-changing games. I am very grateful that during this otherwise dark time, something this surprising and hopeful could happen for us."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;There is nothing more meaningful that we could be putting our time into than this.&quot;">"There is nothing more meaningful that we could be putting our time into than this."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Around 50 people are currently working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the studio. The majority are full-time employees, but that number also includes part-time contractors and co-developers at partner studios.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that the studio is independent, its mission has shifted from launching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> exclusively on Netflix to bringing the title to a variety of platforms. That, naturally, will require more work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our goal for 2026 is straightforward and very personal to us: launch a big, ambitious cozy game that brings people together, encourages kindness, and reduces loneliness in the world. A game literally about building a village together," said Edery.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/arc-raiders-hits-12-million-sales-a-wild-rebuttal-from-bobby-kotick-and-a-deluge-of-layoffs-patch-notes-36" target="_self" data-discover="true">Arc Raiders hits 12 million sales, a wild rebuttal from Bobby Kotick, and a deluge of layoffs - Patch Notes #36</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know from extensive research that loneliness is massively harming people's health and happiness, and even causing premature death. So we believe there is nothing more meaningful that we could be putting our time into than this. On a personal note, I'd much rather give up my salary and the security of a big company job than be doing anything else right now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio is targeting a public beta in spring 2026 (April - June) before a full launch later in the year.
