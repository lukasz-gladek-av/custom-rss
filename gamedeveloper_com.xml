The team is only able to publicly talk about its work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Creative Mode and the Borderlands spinoff </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes three. But it's been a busy seven years for Patel, Hellquist, and their colleagues. After starting Stray Kite, they dove into the world of co-development and Unreal Engine development, creating the original Fortnite Creative game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prop Hunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, now one of many islands that are part of the Unreal Engine Fortnite UGC system. They had the unusual task of not only trying to make games for Fortnite Creative, but also solving game design problems to create assets and workflows that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players could use in their own Fortnite Creative games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/ea-will-shut-down-origin-later-this-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA will shut down Origin later this year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing we tried to do in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to make games you can't easily make in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," Patel recalled a bit sheepishly. "There was a little bit of mixed goals when we were working on that stuff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After spending time with Epic, Stray Kite expanded its list of clients, eventually reuniting Hellquist with his former colleagues at Gearbox on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Co-development allowed Hellquist and Patel to intimately see how different studios are run, offering a rare opportunity to compare and contrast different ways of making games and picking the ones that worked for their shop. "We've taken some [processes] we've liked from some places...and we've put some things to the side that we know we don't want to do," said Hellquist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the COVID-era venture capital boom hit the video game industry, Patel said he and Hellquist deliberately chose to avoid that line of funding, continuing to "bootstrap" the company. "It would have been easy to go there," Patel said, also acknowledging the company wasn't "immune" to the layoffs and cost-cutting that started in 2022.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/california-fire-relief-bundle-is-calling-for-submissions-from-game-developers" target="_self" data-discover="true">California Fire Relief Bundle is calling for submissions from game developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite those challenges, Patel and Hellquist decided it was finally time for Stray Kite to greenlight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The pair said it's a product born of their loves of system-driven games to drive player agency. But peeking over their shoulder, you can see a bit of that Fortnite Creative energy still lingering on the product—because as the pair explained it, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mashes together genres, systems, and themes that don't work well together at first glance.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wartorn'"><span>Wartorn'</span>s real-time strategy and roguelike gameplay</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a single-player strategy game as inspired by Bungie's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myth: The Fallen Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is modern roguelikes like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players take on the role of two siblings building an army of fantasy creatures to lead a caravan across a war-ravaged country and reunite with their family. Hellquist says Stray Kite is releasing the game in Early Access not just for economic reasons, but because the game is a "genre blend" that needs player feedback in development to properly mix together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know that we don't know everything we need to know," Hellquist said, accidentally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">invoking an infamous Donald Rumsfeld quote.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "Having players be on that journey with us helps us understand what they need and what they want out of this kind of experience."</span></p><p>Image via Stray Kite Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> balances their desire to push "player agency." Sometimes through familiar means, like a systems-driven elemental system that lets players experiment with cause-and-effect (and react to what goes wrong). Some of it is in conventional choice-driven narrative that balances the needs of the caravan against morality, evoking the mechanics of 11 bit studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This War of Mine </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Stoic Studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Banner Saga.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even if the pair want players to make their own choices and tell their own stories, they want those choices to take place against the backdrop of real-world struggles. The game's story of two young heroes fleeing a region racked by war is a personal one for Patel, who described how his parents fled Tanzania under the threat of violence. His mom had to abandon the dog that protected her from thieves and his father literally buried gold near his home in the hopes of one day returning to reclaim it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He never did. "There's some gold buried in Tanzania you can go get," Patel joked. "We've got this extremism that happened here, and it's personal to me...and it's personal for so many people in the world and throughout all of human history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a case study of where developers can rely on the "familiar" to experiment with something new. While Stray Kite pushes the boundaries on the game's setting and core gameplay, it's relying on familiar fantasy conventions and the popularity of roguelike progression to help players ground themselves. It's also an ambitious choice to tap the real-time strategy genre—though Patel said he prefers to think of it as "real-time tactics" given the smaller focus. "We've started calling this a real time tactics game, because it's a little closer to that," he said. "We're trying to distance ourselves from that expectation [that there will be] base building and managing people, gathering berries and things like that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One might wonder if blending a dormant genre with roguelike mechanics (something that's not really been done successfully, as Hellquist noted) is a wise choice for a small team trying to stay financially afloat. But the pair hope other developers can join them in making these unusual blends of games. "I'm afraid we as an industry are going to stagnate," Hellquist said. "We don't feel like we can explore in the triple-A space the way he used to. I'm not sure a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be made any more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Financial survival doesn't have to translate to taking the safest choices possible. Stray Kite Studios is trying to show the game industry that taking risks isn't just about fulfilling the creative spirit—when well-grounded, it can be what helps your team evolve and grow instead of remaining stagnant.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
