The title was called a "break out hit" by one Xbox exec, but that couldn't save the studio from closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was, however, granted a second chance by PUBG maker Krafton, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-franchise-from-microsoft">acquired the Japanese company from Microsoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in August 2024â€“</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tango-gameworks-developer-documents-the-studio-s-final-day">months after Tango looked dead in the water</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, Krafton said it intended to "maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> IP and explore future projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy">Speaking to Game Developer about the acquisition a few weeks later</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Krafton CEO Changhan 'CH' Kim said the move was about preserving the legacy of Tango Gameworks and described it as a "last minute deal."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim acknowledged that projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might not rake in cash, but suggested studios like Tango should be encouraged to experiment with new ideas regardless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to maintain their legacy," said Kim. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton acquired the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> franchise alongside Tango, and a sequel is very much on the cards. Discussing how Tango would look under Krafton, Kim claimed the studio would look to hire "a minimum of 100 people," including many former employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Perhaps they'll need a bigger team. We haven't decided on that, but we don't plan to reduce the size of the team at all," added Kim. "They have to work on new projects as well, so there is a great possibility the team will scale up even further."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
