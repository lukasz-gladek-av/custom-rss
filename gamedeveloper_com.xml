Soup season is officially BACK. Summer is dead and so it's time to dust off your gourds, cultivate some carrots, and find the chunkiest, hunkiest slab of bread you can muster. Oh, and if you aren't absolutely slathering that cob in butter, you aren't doing it right.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This week, I kicked off the festivities in appropriate fashion by rustling up a warming spiced carrot and lentil soup. The secret ingredients? Toasted cumin seeds, chilli flakes, and dreams. It's nirvana in a bowl, and as you can probably tell from this opening salvo, I am living for it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's something innately comforting about soups, stews, and other gloopy concoctions. I don't quite understand why they spark such wild delirium within my soul, but I crave those autumnal evenings that demand nothing other than pottering around my apartment while a pot of soup simmers on the stove. The aromas. The hues. The slurping. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am mad for it, and in what might be the most seamless segue of all time, I'm also mad for video game news. That was rough.

The company explained the move will open new revenue channels for its creator community—not least because, starting in December 2025 until the end of 2026, developers will earn 100 percent of the V-Bucks' value from item sold on their islands.

Valve has made answering that eternal quandary a little bit easier this week by integrating revenue and unit data into Steam's discount history pages. The move is designed to help developers more efficiently analyse the impact of discounts and make more informed decisions when planning future promotions. Better yet, it'll also give metric-heads even more data to pore over.
