"Because of each of you, I’ve been blessed to be on this journey with you!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lipscomb began his industry career in QA at Maxis on 1990's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SimEarth: The Living Planet. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">After more QA gigs, he became a marketing director at GameTek in 1994.

Previously, he took a hands-off approach with NetEase Games, but sources told the outlet his direct involvement over the past year has been "dramatic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current staff expressed concern about Ding's focus on moneymakers and disinterest in any project that wouldn't generate "hundreds of millions of dollars per year."

Ding reportedly wanted to avoid paying licensing fees to Disney so it could use popular characters like Spider-Man and Wolverine, and allegedly told NetEase artists to use their own hero designs instead of Marvel-made ones. The attempted cancelation, which NetEase later denied to Bloomberg, was said to have cost "millions of dollars."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this week, a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">United States support team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rivals </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was laid off.
