He also, however, said OpenAI hoped to make the technology so compelling that many people would be happy to see their characters featured.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Altman also took the time to acknowledge the "remarkable creative output" of Japan. "We are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">OpenAI has been hit with a number of lawsuits in recent years, with many creators taking issue with the company's 'ask forgiveness, not permission' approach to scraping the internet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just last week, a judge allowed a consolidated class-action lawsuit from a number of authors, including Game of Thrones scribe George R.
