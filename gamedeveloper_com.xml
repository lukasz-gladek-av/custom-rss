            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity has told developers they should expect strong "guardrails" to be placed around its AI tools after their copyright-infringing capabilities were inadvertently tested by the engine maker on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2494707359">a now-deleted official stream</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Unity informed Game Developer it had taken down the stream midway through writing this story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the stream, which aired on June 24, 2025, Unity senior advocate for emerging tech Manuel Sainsily accidentally confirmed the current version of Unity AI is capable of generating assets based off copyrighted content—in this case, Disney's widely recognized mascot Mickey Mouse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sainsily and senior community manager Jackson Stevens had been responding to a viewer who asked what would happen if a user told Unity AI to generate a sprite of Mickey Mouse. Stevens stated he'd successfully tested the existing guardrails in his own time, but Sainsily said that Unity has "no control" over the asset generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Maybe the data might show some weird stuff," he said, before prompting the tool to generate an asset based on "Disney Mickey Mouse." Four images of the squeaky-voiced mascot then appeared in the asset library.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the incident, a Unity spokesperson stressed that one of the company's goals with its AI betas is to "make sure the right guardrails are in place to help prevent copyright issues, especially before those tools are generally available."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/keita-takahashi-sent-over-a-bunch-of-adorable-to-a-t-storyboard-sketches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the Scenes: Check out Keita Takahashi's adorable To a T storyboard sketches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unity AI gives developers access to both our own first-party AI models and third-party tools (used to generate visual assets like 2D images and sprites)," the spokesperson said said, later confirming the feature shown in the stream was from a third-party tool. "Our first-party AI models are trained </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/jIKXClYvpnuPglpMGHGfDhzhoM0?domain=unity.com">only on licensed or open-source data</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—not unlicensed assets." They noted that third-party tools are being developed by external providers who may use models like Stable Diffusion or GPT-Image, "which means there's a chance copyrighted content could show up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The spokesperson said Unity is working with external providers to prevent such incidents, and that it is flagging the Mickey Mouse generation from last Tuesday's stream as part of that effort. "Using unlicensed IP in a commercial project would violate both copyright law and our terms of service," they added.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Disney is baring its fangs at AI toolmakers that replicate its characters">Disney is baring its fangs at AI toolmakers that replicate its characters</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Showing off Unity AI's ability to generate Mickey Mouse comes at a touchy moment for generative AI toolmakers.

"The primary legal risk for developers using AI tools used to generate copyrighted images is that the output may be substantially similar to someone else's protected work," he explained in an email to Game Developer. "Even if the developer didn't intend to infringe, if it looks similar it's likely to draw unwanted attention," such as cease-and-desist letters, takedown notices, or a lawsuit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Legal risk doesn't necessarily stop at the source—it can often flow downstream."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity has done its best to reassure developers developers about the safety of its generative AI tools when it comes to copyright risks. Its initial rollout of Unity Muse and Unity Sentis, along with a marketplace of "AI-Verified Solutions" was meant to let developers access tools without fear of violating copyright.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">24 hours later, the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-yanks-third-party-ai-modelling-tool-atlas-from-storefront-after-one-day">removed a tool called "Atlas"</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from its marketplace for violating its terms of service.
