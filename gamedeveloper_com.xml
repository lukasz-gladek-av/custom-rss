Meanwhile, Atari has entered into an agreement to invest in the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as Thunderful continues to generate negative cash flow, the restructuring is "expected to result in cost reductions," and thereby result in "improved cash flow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of June 30, the company's net debt amounted to SEK 85 million (around $8.8 million) and available liquidity was SEK 32 million (around $3.3 million). The restructuring, which includes workforce reductions within its game development studios and publishing arm (as well as reductions within other group-wide services), is expect to result in cost reductions of SEK 6-8 million (around $622,000-$829,000) during the second half of 2025, and SEK 40-45 million (around $4.1 to $4.6 million) for the full year 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said that the publishing business has had "a challenging quarter," pointing out its over-dependency on individual game releases as a problem. In particular, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, released on June 17, has shown "weaker sales than expected." The co-development and services business area has had a "utilization rate during the second quarter in line with expectations," but the company says it remains dependent on "securing existing and new customers for 2026 and beyond."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/secret-6-madrid-will-strike-against-owner-testronic-to-secure-fair-severance" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Secret 6 Madrid workers call off strike after agreeing severance terms with Testronic</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues," Thunderful chairman Patrick Svensk said. "At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today's restructuring is the latest in a series of divestments and layoffs within Thunderful.

Then, in November, the company announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thunderful-is-restructuring-its-publishing-division-and-cutting-even-more-jobs">yet another restructuring plan</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for its publishing business, laying off between 80 and 100 employees.

According to the announcement, the transaction has received unanimous support from Thunderful's board of directors, as well as two of Thunderful's shareholders, Owe Bergsten and Brjann Sigurgeirsson, who together own 29.9 percent of the capital and voting rights in the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Atari won't be required to make a mandatory bid offer for the remaining shares in Thunderful under Swedish takeover rules, thanks to an exemption granted by the Swedish Securities Council.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-co-op-climbing-hit-peak-achieved-2-million-sales-for-less-than-200-000-" target="_self" data-discover="true">How co-op climbing hit Peak achieved 2 million sales for less than $200,000</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This transaction marks another important milestone in Atari’s development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region," chairman and chief executive officer of Atari, SA, Wade Rosen, said. "Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful’s teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in September 2024, Rosen told Game Developer that the company is done being a "fast follower," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-ceo-wade-rosen-says-the-company-is-done-being-a-fast-follower-">after spending millions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> acquiring studios like Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios, which have become "North Star" deals for Atari. He also said that the company "wouldn't say no" to more studio acquisitions, but not without being wary of the complexity and the potential for things to go wrong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What people also don't consider is the opportunity cost," Rosen said at the time. "As soon as you do that it takes your team a long time to merge and start working together. That will come at the cost of doing something else. [...] I have to remind myself of that all the time. It's not just the cost of paying, it's the fact that I've paid a cost and am now having to give up an opportunity. Those [acquisitions] will make sense, but they're few and far between. We're trying to stay focused on the main goal, which is sustainability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has contacted Thunderful Group for more information on the restructuring.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
