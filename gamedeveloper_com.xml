Post written by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Brode and his team faced the interesting challenge of making a game simple enough for an extremely wide audience to vibe with, while still somehow giving themselves enough design space to introduce new cards and mechanics regularly over the course of several years. Solving these problems first required a concrete understanding of what the core game is, and to obtain that, the team had to experiment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming an expert in the game you are designing">Becoming an expert in the game you are designing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the process is becoming an expert in your game, right?" Brode says. "When we first started out, I didn't know the right number of cards per location, the right number of locations, the right number of turns for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the right number of energy to start with. We tried seven turns and five turns, and starting on turn two and nine cards per location and four cards per location, three cards per location and two cards per location, and infinite cards per location. We tried everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Brode continues, these variables coalesce into the foundation of the product, and once that's all settled, you can go about the business of actually designing cards. But how much viable content can your new game actually support?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to actually make sure you can make a bunch of stuff," Brode says. "Like if your goal was 'Hey, let's make Tic Tac Toe a live service game,' and we're gonna add cards you can play before every turn of Tic Tac Toe … there's a couple designs that may be kind of interesting and not broken but not that many."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this hypothetical, Brode would ideally design out a year's worth of content just to see if the idea had legs. "Even if you don't end up shipping any of those cards, you're like, 'Oh my God, I've used all the design space, Tic Tac Toe is too simplistic. I just can't come up with another 500 of these for the next 10 years.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table">Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant also speaks with Brode about Second Dinner's embrace of Godot for another project that's already in development. The engine has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years, Brode says, thanks in-part to its open source nature and the responsive folk shepherding the project. And for his team specifically, Godot offers tremendous value in its ability to issue over-the-air updates for "literally anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we're writing the whole game in [GDScript] … this means if we wanted to do something like launch on a platform that is maybe notoriously difficult to get new content and new features shipped live to players quickly, well, we can just do that over the air without having to go through an approvals pipeline for [a] AAA platform," says Brode. "That could take a long time and we just don't have to do that. We can just quickly get stuff to players in a day or something. That's really mega, especially for a live service project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Listen to the rest of our really mega conversation on your podcast platform of choice, and might we be so bold as to suggest adding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to your March to-do list for more valuable insights from leading developers?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

"This grant opens doors for us to significantly improve and expand Codecks, amplifying the tools we offer and creating new ones, making project management as fun and efficient as possible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With this grant, we're empowered to make that vision even bigger, with features that make Codecks more valuable for every team member-whatever their project, wherever they are in the world," continued fellow co-founder Daniel Berndt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As outlined on Codecks' newest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecks.io/blog/2024/codecks-reaches-one-million-investment/">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company is aiming to deliver new features in 2025, including a revamped, separate Vision Board that lets users see the overall development of their project. It likened the upcoming iteration to a "skill tree, but for your game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More information on Codecks can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecks.io/features/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
