Starting August 11, experiences that get the "Sensitive Issues" label will receive the descriptor on their details page and will be unavailable by default for users under the age of 13, although parents of older teens can choose to enable access if they wish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issues, according to the company, involve "current sensitive social, political, and religious" themes. As per the announcement, the descriptor is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue," and Roblox anticipates "very few experiences will receive this label."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Said experiences must also meet both the "polarized viewpoints" and "strong emotional response" criteria. The first involves whether the issue has a "limited number of strongly opposing viewpoints with little room for compromise or middle ground," while the second relates to whether or not the issue evokes strong reactions and/or "passionate debate" from players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-lauds-ai-powered-ad-platform-after-q2-results-exceed-expectations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity lauds AI-powered ad platform after Q2 results exceed expectations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, issues such as immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, prayer in schools, racial profiling, affirmative action, vaccination policies, and reproductive rights qualify as 'sensitive issues,'" reads the announcement. "Please note that this is not a comprehensive or finite list - any issue that meets the above criteria qualifies as a 'sensitive issue.' These issues are topics that are frequently in the news and inspire strong opinions and emotional debate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more specific example, the company said that an experience with a core gameplay loop focusing on immigration or border security would qualify, but one that simply includes references to countries and borders would not. Both experiences in this example would still be covered by Roblox's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">content maturity guidelines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox said that experiences that fall under the descriptor will not be suspended or removed from the platform, and instances where consequences would apply are for creators who repeatedly provide inaccurate information in the questionnaire.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'">'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it understands that identifying sensitive issues can be complex and varies greatly by region. As such, if Roblox's moderation teams find experiences that haven't accurately disclosed sensitive issues via the questionnaire, they'll reach out to the creator to correct the answers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devcom-speaker-survey-2025-majority-of-respondents-claim-traditional-platform-exclusives-will-go-extinct" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom Speaker Survey 2025: Majority of respondents claim traditional platform exclusives will go extinct</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know that adapting to new guidelines can take time, and our goal is always to equip parents with the best tools to manage their children’s experiences while still allowing creators to innovate and express themselves," the announcement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the FAQ section, Roblox says that "this change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request." While the company recognizes that topics like social, political, and religious issues can be handled "in a way that is developmentally appropriate," it can't always guarantee the case due to the amount of user-generated content hosted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent times, some </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experiences have allowed people to attend virtual protests.
