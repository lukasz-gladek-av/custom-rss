As of today, that initiative will include titles delisted by their individual developers, starting with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft 1 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gog.prowly.com/368813-warcraft-i-and-ii-soon-to-leave-gog-gog-preservation-program-announces-a-new-feature">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the PC platform revealed Blizzard requested the two titles be pulled from its storefront on December 13. GOG confirmed it would comply with the request, but ensured the games would live on through its program. Going forward, it pledged to "maintain [a game's] compatibility, even if it gets delisted from the store."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players who own those delisted games "can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles," continued GOG, and the support will also take any "potential changes in Windows OS" that would impact a game's playability into account.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Press X to preserve">Press X to preserve</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gog.prowly.com/364710-gog-re-releases-100-improved-classic-games-as-part-of-the-new-gog-preservation-program">GOG Preservation Program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> offers a commitment to the older games on the platform, guaranteeing they are compatible with modern or future PC hardware Currently, the Program only covers Windows platforms, and features such titles as the first three Resident Evil titles, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-how-gog-perfected-the-imperfect-with-the-re-release-of-alpha-protocol">Alpha Protocol</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the Ultimate Edition of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last month, the company explained it wanted to address the concerns of game preservation which have grown in the past year.

The Office backed specific comments from the ESA that critiqued the VGHF's stance and claimed it failed to show "that reproducing works to allow for multiple simultaneous use in the computer program class is likely to be fair."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to the two Warcraft games, GOG said it was "incredibly proud of the work we've done bringing them back to life after decades of unavailability. While the delisting is unfortunate, we assure you that every user who already owns these games on GOG will continue to benefit from our commitment and have access to versions that remain compatible with modern systems, preserving their experience for years to come."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
