Yet, here we are.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sultry little morsel, by the way. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuxbvE9wcjs">You should slap it on</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a surreal experience about tending a farm with decidedly human livestock, has been banned from both Steam and the Epic Games Store for breaching platform guidelines. There has been a lot of speculation as to what specific content resulted in the ban—but despite standing firm in their respective decisions, both Valve and Epic have failed to clearly outline precisely what, exactly, they considered to be so egregious.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And that is the real horror of the entire affair. Two titanic storefronts that control access to a huge portion of the PC market have blacklisted a title seemingly without rhyme or reason. It has left developer Santa Ragione in the lurch, unable to tweak their product because it has no idea what, exactly, needs tweaking.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The comments provided to press by both companies failed to clarify the situation, and that should raise alarm bells.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve and Epic aren't obligated to sell any product on their platform, but when two companies (and let's be real, we're mainly talking about Valve here) absolutely dominate a market in such a way, the least developers and consumers should expect is transparency when key decisions are made.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wreckreation-developer-puts-entire-studio-on-redundancy-notice" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wreckreation developer puts entire studio on redundancy notice</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remember folks, some art is meant to be a little uncomfortable.

That means the streamer has bid farewell to Spry Fox, which has been sold back to its founding team just a few years after Netflix purchased the studio. Thankfully, the studio's upcoming multiplayer life-sim, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, will remain in development and will still be published by Netflix.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-partners-with-j-j-abrams-bad-robot-games-as-producer-and-publisher" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony partners with J.J.

This week, the newly-liberated company announced it has officially turned independent and will now operate as a "fully autonomous organization" following a successful management buyout. Arc will continue to be steered by its existing management team and already has a slate of projects simmering away on the back burner.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embracer Group has made even more Eidos-Montreal workers redundant"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/">Embracer Group has made even more Eidos-Montreal workers redundant</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Insider Gaming // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Embracer keeps suggesting it has turned over a new leaf after splitting into three standalone companies, but old habits evidently die hard because the Swedish conglomerate remains alarmingly committed to laying off employees. This isn't the first time workers at Eidos-Montreal have been pushed out of the door by their benevolent parent company in 2025, and some Insider Gaming sources claim additional cuts are being planned. With an employer like that, who needs enemies?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saudi Arabia is about to own the vast majority of Electronic Arts"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be">Saudi Arabia is about to own the vast majority of Electronic Arts</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via The Wall Street Journal //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It's no secret that Saudi Arabia is preparing to acquire EA with the help of a rather unsavoury investor consortium, but it has so far been unclear how ownership of the U.S. publisher will be divided among the triumvirate. Well, now we know. According to a regulatory filing submitted in Brazil, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, PIF, will take a whopping 93.4 percent stake in EA if the take-private is approved. Culture washers, rejoice.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-makes-eight-more-accessibility-patents-free-to-use" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA makes eight more accessibility patents free-to-use</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Russia blocks access to US children's gaming platform Roblox"><a target="_blank" href="http://Russia%20blocks%20access%20to%20US%20children's%20gaming%20platform%20Roblox">Russia blocks access to US children's gaming platform Roblox</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Reuters //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Roblox is in hot water yet again, but this time the popular platform has been admonished for all of the wrong reasons. Regulators in Russia have blocked Roblox—which is currently enjoyed by over 151 million users each day—for hosting what they claim is extremist propaganda in the form of LGBTQ+ content. It's farcical and deeply concerning, but given the Russian supreme court branded the "international LGBT movement" an "extremist organisation" in 2023, entirely predictable.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Horses banned from Epic Games Store just 24 hours before launch"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-just-24-hours-before-launch">Horses banned from Epic Games Store just 24 hours before launch</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Most indies would be thrilled to see their project plastered across the homepages of major publications in the build up to launch—unless, perhaps, that coverage is all about how your make-or-break title has been banned from two major PC storefronts.
