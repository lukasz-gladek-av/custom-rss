As STJV notes, Don't Nod has a near-300 person staff (nearly all of which work remotely), which makes these channels "impossible" to use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Management's goal is to carry out their plan as brutally and quickly as possible," wrote STJV, "by trampling on all checks and balances, to fit in with their games release schedules."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="STJV wants to prevent Don't Nod's &quot;social slaughter&quot;">STJV wants to prevent Don't Nod's "social slaughter"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Along with calling on Don't Nod management to "rethink its position," the union released its own set of provisions to the studio's proposal. Chiefly, those demands call for itself and other labor groups to have the proper amount of delegation time needed to craft an argument (12 hours total), and a minimum 48-hour window between negotiation meetings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, it wants union representatives to have a right to convene for an additional meeting with France's Employment Protection Plan, for CSE-mandated experts to join in on said meetings, and for those experts to have an extended deadline to submit their reports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These demands, said STJV, are "more than legitimate, and are merely intended to maintain a semblance of social dialogue. We urge management to return to serious terms...and to immediately stop twisting the arm of elected representatives already exhausted by years of contempt."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">STJV's full demands for Don't Nod management, and its full accounting of events, can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/layoffs-at-dont-nod-call-for-a-walkout-on-october-28/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
