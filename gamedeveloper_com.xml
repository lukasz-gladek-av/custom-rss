Valve developers Pierre-Loup Griffais and Lawrence Yang didn't mention a specific price, but did provide some insight into what the industry can expect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think that if you build PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that's the general price window that we aim to be at," Griffais said. "Ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal, but we're working on refining that as we speak."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/valve-goes-all-in-on-hardware-with-steam-machine-controller-and-new-vr-device">official Steam page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the "level of performance" mentioned is centered around a "semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU" that aims to deliver 60 FPS at 4K resolution with FSR upscaling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers said external factors have led to this being a "hard time" to decide on a specific price. RAM, for example, has been on a steady increase in recent months, with industry officials pointing to a demand from AI data centers as the biggest cause (via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">The Verge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).
