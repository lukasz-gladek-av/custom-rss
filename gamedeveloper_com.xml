It's taken two forms: the excitement over successful games made by developers who draw deep from cultural or national influences, and the multi-pronged effort to reach new audiences in regions like South Korea, Brazil, China, Kenya, and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like Game Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Sandfall Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Shift Up's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have dominated professional discourse as successful versions of this phenomenon. There isn't any one way to capture the same lightning in a bottle that those three games did, but Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux has an interesting proposal for developers who want to branch out beyond their borders: consider developing "region-specific" versions of your games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Langourieux shared the idea with us in a conversation at DICE 2025, where we'd been discussing the outsourcing company's purchase of Umanaïa, Pipeworks, and Abstraction. There was obviously something self-serving about the pitch: his idea was that developers could tap into Virtuos' network of global studios to let local developers create variants of a game that would appeal to their friends and neighbors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does the idea have any merit beyond filling the coffers of Virtuos and competitors like Keywords or Pole To Win? Maybe—but only if developers can avoid pandering to players </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> not make compromises that favor authoritarian regimes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game studios have been making regional changes for decades">Game studios have been making regional changes for decades</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preparing different versions of games for different regions is anything but new. In 1989 developers like Dynamix prepared different versions of the PC game MechWarrior for MS-DOS in the United States and for the PC-98 and Sharp X68000. Just compare the two "mission completed" screenshots below:</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two versions have similar foundations—a profile picture of the pilot, relevant statistics, some flavor text, and a clan logo—but there are wide gaps in the UI and art direction between the two images.</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile in 2025, companies like Krafton have released regional variants of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pubg-corp-is-bringing-a-new-version-of-banned-i-pubg-mobile-i-to-india">places like India</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—sometimes after the original version of a game was banned by local governments. Localized versions of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/56203-the-chinese-version-of-maldraxxus-is-a-little-weird/">World of Warcraft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-switch/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions™ #FE</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might see (sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/sensitive/memes/vagina-bones">infamous</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) tweaks to character costumes or dialogue based on local cultural standards. And there've been times when developers experimented with story and characters changes with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">Nier Replicant</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">'s</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> international version </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nier Gestalt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our conversation, Langourieux's vision of "region-specific" game version went a little further than the more familiar approach those past examples represent.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Regional versions of games go beyond localization">Regional versions of games go beyond localization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you compare us to the movie industry, it's like we've not taken the good and we've kept the bad," Langourieux explained. He'd been in the middle of proclaiming that game developers needed to pursue shorter production timelines to match other entertainment businesses like film and television.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That industry is extremely agile and flexible with how movies are made...we can surely [create] more flexibility with how games are made, because we all know you need fewer people at the beginning of a game, a lot more in the middle, and fewer at the end."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you try to do that with a fixed team, you end up with waste or layoffs—usually both." He added that remote and distributed development driven by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it easier for teams to build flexibility (that is, if they don't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">implement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> strict </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">RTO policies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His appeal for agility and flexibility led to the discussion of regional game variants. "The bad thing about the movie industry is that...you can only make one movie that's the same movie for everybody. In games, we have the luxury to make different games for different people, and too few studios and publishers are fully leveraging that." He said he's seen more developers in Asia like Garena and Nexon take advantage of this practice than in the West.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first it sounded as though he was saying studios should operate like say, Asobo Studio, which makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Microsoft Flight Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the Plague Tale series. The two series target very different audiences. "My thought is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale: Innocence</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does not have to be the exact same game for people in the US, in Europe, or in Asia," Langourieux said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He quickly followed up that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might not be a great example here, and that he was mainly thinking of big budget live service games—but there are plenty of live service practices creeping back into the world of single-player offline games. You have the Early Access model which turns games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>9 Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Schedule I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into regularly updated games with new features. You have premium games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doing brand crossovers with series like Castlevania.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's hypothetically possible that with the right team, a developer could release content better catered to a local audience's needs.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have the growing PC install and mobile install base in newer economies like Southeast Asia and South America," he said. "And that creates opportunities to customize content in order to increase the likelihood of success of the game and earn overseas market share."</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't a risk-free proposition. Make a regional change without anyone from the area on the development team could lead to inadvertently offensive content or come off as pandering. And the question of how far developers are willing to go in regions where LGBTQ individuals, women, and ethnic minorities are restricted could create unexpected ethical quandaries similar to those we've already seen through regional changes to games in places where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamerant.com/spider-man-2-lgbtq-pride-flags-removed-saudi-arabia/">depictions of homosexuality</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are banned or restricted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Langourieux has a point. The flexibility of digital assets and downloadable updates means the game industry has more agency in globalization than other popular mediums. The main remaining question: can this practice benefit developers not chasing recurring revenue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">the live service business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
