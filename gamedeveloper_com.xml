While the company still hasn't released pricing info for the SteamOS-based hardware, it has shed some light on its verification process in a new interview with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang, developers hoping for a "Steam Machine Verified" badge can expect "fewer constraints" than Steam Deck Verification. "One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine," Yang continued. VR developers seeking Steam Frame verification may expect a different process, though Yang said Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" as it does for the other verification programs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "Steam Deck Verified" badge has proven to be more than a mere quality assessor when releasing games on Steam. It's also been a major marketing beat for developers—one so potent companies like Microsoft-owned Bethesda are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/quake-is-now-steam-deck-verified-223009852.html">publicizing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Steam Deck Verified status for classic games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Quake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A "Verified" badge also means your game might appear on the "Great on Deck" section of the Steam Store, the default store page found when accessing the marketplace on the device.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-steam-awards-2025-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hollow Knight: Silksong is the Steam Awards' 2025 Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve didn't provide additional technical requirements for earning the "Steam Machine Verified" status—though it did offer some details on why it created the Steam Controller Puck pairing system that reflects its hardware philosophy.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Valve's goal: &quot;It just works&quot;">Valve's goal: "It just works"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's Steam Controller Puck, the device that can both charge and pair a Steam Controller to any PC it's plugged into, was a small surprise in the Steam Machine hardware reveal. Most controller manufacturers have settled on using Bluetooth or USB-C as their main means of pairing controllers. Valve says it created this extra piece of hardware to address issues not with Bluetooth itself, but the environments people play in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While Bluetooth is a great wireless connection method, we found in our testing that people’s home wireless environments and PC Bluetooth capabilities are highly variable (clogged networks, wireless interference, increased latency when using multiple BT devices, etc.)," said engineer Steve Cardinali.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cardinali added that the Puck "addresses these issues."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Another problem we set out to solve was the fact that dedicated wireless receivers that are plugged directly into the back of a PC near other USB ports can create interference issues. Adding the charging capability encourages people to leave the puck in a place where it's likely to have minimal interference while providing a really easy charging experience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/valve-will-soon-support-android-games-on-steam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve will soon support Android games on Steam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It just works" has become a key strategic philosophy for Valve as it develops products that approach the plug-and-play reliability of the classic console market. Seeing that philosophy expand from the "Verified" badge to the controller pairing system shows there may be more untapped potential in making the PC video game market a less-fiddly and more accessible experience.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
