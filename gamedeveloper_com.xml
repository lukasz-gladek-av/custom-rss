On January 1, 2025, subscribers will have a 100-hour "monthly playtime allowance" for members of its paid Performance and Ultimate Tiers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After hitting the 100-hour cap, subscribers can buy 15 more hours for $3 (Performance) or $6 (Ultimate). If a subscriber has up to 15 hours of unused playtime, that time will be automatically rolled over to the following month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subscription services for games often withhold what (or how) players have access to through their membership tiers, as we've recently seen with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-game-pass-may-expand-with-more-subscription-tiers">Xbox Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. NVIDIA restricting play time is another matter entirely, particularly as other companies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-wants-all-digital-xbox-series-x-in-2024-next-gen-cloud-hybrid-xbox-in-2028">Microsoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are trying to carve out a niche in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-secures-exclusive-cloud-streaming-rights-to-activision-blizzard-titles">cloud game market</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cap is being set "to continue providing exceptional quality and speed, as well as shorter queue times, to members," NVIDIA explained on Reddit. It acknowledged this limit will only affect 6 percent of its subscribersâ€”the other 94 percent "typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe," and will be "comfortably accommodated."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing between features and pricing will shift over time with any streaming platform, leading to a price increase (again, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-increasing-price-of-xbox-game-pass-introducing-new-standard-plan-that-ditches-day-one-access">Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), or a change to the benefits offered by a subscription tier, similar to Amazon Prime Video.

Several titles that launched on a subscription service have stumbled out of the gate (see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Foamstars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) or start strong before fizzling out.
