But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">wrote the company on the Steam Hardware blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-studio-ares-interactive-secures-70-million-investment" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mobile studio Ares Interactive secures $70 million investment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame). Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how the Steam Machine will perform when it does eventually arrive, Valve said the dinky cube will be capable of playing the majority of Steam titles at 4K 60FPS with FSR. It did, however, note that some games currently require more upscaling than others, meaning it might be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles," added Valve.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those with a penchant for design, Valve also confirmed it plans to share faceplate CAD specs so customers and manufacturers can tinker with all manner of customisation options.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
