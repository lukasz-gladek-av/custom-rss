In what's becoming something of a trend, another major game company became embroiled in legal proceedings—but this week it was Tencent's turn to feel the wrath of the merciless court filing after Sony took the conglomerate to task for allegedly producing a "slavish" Horizon clone. The claws were out in that one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As always, we've gathered all the must-read headlines and gossip for your viewing pleasure.

The company claimed Tencent's upcoming survival adventure, Light of Motiram, is a "blatant" and "unlawful" copy of its own sci-fi series. Tencent describes the game as taking place in a "world overrun by colossal machines" on its Steam store page. Sound familiar? Sony wants a court to prevent Tencent from marketing and distributing the title, and in a wild twist even alleges that Tencent sought to license the Horizon IP in 2024 before revealing Light of Motiram a few months later. Get the popcorn in.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="EA CEO claims EA Sports will become the 'most valuable sports business in the world'"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-claims-ea-sports-will-become-the-most-valuable-sports-business-in-the-world-">EA CEO claims EA Sports will become the 'most valuable sports business in the world'</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">It's in the game—or at least, it used to be. EA boss Andrew Wilson claims EA Sports will transcend its humble origins as a mere video game studio to become the "'most valuable sports business in the world." He made the rather zealous proclamation during the company's latest earnings call, and suggested the burgeoning division will continue to explore ways to engage and integrate with real-world sports teams and their fans to cultivate "deeply immersive, socially driven experiences."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-s-grow-a-garden-had-nearly-22-million-concurrent-users-in-july" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox UGC game Grow a Garden had nearly 22 million concurrent users in July</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-reality-labs-is-still-losing-billions">Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Meta's freewheeling metaverse division, Reality Labs, continues to use cash as kindling. The business lost $4.5 billion during the second quarter of the current fiscal year, with Meta attributing those losses (jn part) to declining Quest headset sales. Reality Labs was wrestled into being to fulfil Meta's grandiose metaverse ambitions, but has now lost over $56 billion since 2022. I wish I had that sort of pocket change.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microsoft becomes PlayStation's top publisher and annual Xbox Game Pass revenue nears $5 billion"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion">Microsoft becomes PlayStation's top publisher and annual Xbox Game Pass revenue nears $5 billion</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Xbox's decision to pull major first-party franchises such as Forza, Gears of War, and Indiana Jones over to PlayStation might've raised eyebrows in some rather entrenched corners of the industry, but it looks like that gambit is paying off. During a recent earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company was "the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation" during the last quarter thanks to the successful launches Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. He also confirmed the company has 40 titles in development across its studios, which recently suffered another round of layoffs at the hands of the U.S. company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turkey-based-mobile-dev-good-job-games-raises-60m-series-a-round" target="_self" data-discover="true">Turkey-based mobile dev Good Job Games raises $60M Series A round</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-are-not-losing-money-they-re-gaining-less-aheartfulofgames-accuses-parent-company-outright-games-of-mismanagement-ahead-of-purported-closure">'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Madrid-based studio Aheartfulofgames came out swinging this week and accused its parent company Outright Games of mismanagement and neglect after being marked for closure. The team, known for working on licensed titles like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, said they have been abandoned so their parent company can prioritize "low-cost, fast-turnaround projects." They also allege that Outright outsourced work that could have been handled internally to justify the closure. "They have made it clear this isn't an economic decision, but the economic context provides them an explanation for what they are doing—but they are not losing money, they're gaining less," said one source.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pokémon TCG Pocket will change card art after plagiarism accusations"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/715823/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia-tracing-lanjiujiu">Pokémon TCG Pocket will change card art after plagiarism accusations</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via The Verge // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The Pokemon Company made the rather unprecedented move of yanking two rare (digital) trading cards out of players' hands this week after Chinese artist lanjiujiu pointed out they appeared to incorporate traced versions of their original fan artwork. Pokemon TCG Pocket's immersive Ho-Oh card (from the new Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion) featured an image of the legendary bird that was almost identical to one created by lanjiujiu. Although The Pokemon Company has a legal right to use fan artwork, the company replaced the Ho-oh EX card and its Lugia EX counterpart with placeholders and said its production team had provided "incorrect reference materials" as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to produce the artwork. It has now launched an investigation to ensure "no similar issues exist in the game."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="IWGB union demands a seat on new UK Video Games Council"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/open-letter-regarding-the-uk-video-games-council/">IWGB union demands a seat on new UK Video Games Council</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via IWGB Game Workers // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">UK game workers union IWGB has published an open letter to Labour ministers Sir Chris Bryant MP and Charlotte Nichols MP to demand a seat on the government's new UK Video Game Council. The union also criticised the makeup of the council, which is dominated by members who work at companies in London and the South of England. "The UK Video Games Council includes no trade unions, no worker representatives, and no voices from grassroots initiatives, that have supported vulnerable workers for years," reads the letter. "How can a body responsible for shaping the future of digital play ignore the very people making video games?" It's a fair question.

Steam and Itch said the popular payment services objected to the sale of NSFW content, forcing them to change their rules. It turns out, however, that a group called Collective Short, which professes to fight "sexploitation" was at least partially to blame for the wave of censorship that washed across the game industry almost overnight. Now, Aftermath has spoken with those who are attempting to form a counter-campaign and force payment companies and game platforms to rethink their stance by weaponizing the power of... phone calls?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'Make it political:' How can the Brazilian game industry establish itself on the global stage?"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-">'Make it political:' How can the Brazilian game industry establish itself on the global stage?</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In this long-read straight out of Brazil, we sit down with a number of local developers and advocates to understand where the region is excelling when it comes to producing video games and where there is room for improvement.
