Pathetic, sodden, and alone. You might be tempted to compare me to a lowly worm, but let's not drag them down with me. "Oh god," I groan—and yet, this is my world. I am comfortable here. The unmistakable squelch of my face slamming into the cold, moist, dirt has become a warm embrace. A single, thunderous note in a never-ending symphony of failure. And, crucially, a reminder that I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tried</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the pain and pleasure of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wasn't quite sure how I'd respond to Bennett Foddy's latest sadomasochistic opus. I had seen people attempt and repeatedly fail to crack his previous nightmare, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but there was something about the idea of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that felt alluring in its apparent simplicity.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an open-world walking simulator about getting from Point A to Point B using two limbs commonly known as legs. It's a task anybody who's played a video game will almost certainly underestimate. The rub, you see, is that players must puppeteer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' wobbly protagonist, Nate, using an unforgiving but undoubtedly precise set of controls.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking a single step forward requires players to carefully control each of Nate's legs by choosing when, where, and how to raise and plant his feet. You must also manage his shifting body weight while attempting to forensically analyze a series of increasingly complex obstacles that are designed to punish even the smallest misstep.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/read-up-on-new-guidance-for-implementing-accessibility-tags-in-storefronts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Read the ESA's new guidance for storefront accessibility tags</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is brutal and relentless and impossibly compelling.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fearing the &quot;Manbreaker&quot;">Fearing the "Manbreaker"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've poured more hours than I care to admit into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> this week and have yet to reach the final hurdle—which from what I've seen on social media is appropriately called "The Manbreaker." But I've slowly come to understand that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a video game about the journey, not the destination.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Watching Nate ragdoll off a mountain like a stupid great big spaghetti man still hasn't lost its charm after so many hours, and like I said earlier, there is something strangely soothing about knowing he will eventually crash to earth and begin his journey anew. Mud-splattered. Pride in tatters. But somehow resolute.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Hello darkness my old friend...</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Failure in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is unavoidable. You can only accept it. When you do, you'll realize there is only victory in defeat.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, during my first attempt to cross a rather precarious 'bridge' set atop a mountain path (this particular crossing consisted a single plank of wood precariously positioned over a crashing waterfall), Nate's foot slipped during the final stretch and I immediately toppled into the suffocating foam only to resurface at the very base of the peak.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-story-changes-were-made-to-sustain-player-interest-over-time" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth story changes were made to sustain player interest over time</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My frustration, however, was fleeting. I spun around to see a lavish toilet cubicle set atop a small island in the middle of the lake that had cushioned my fall. What delights and sweet relief would await within? No spoilers here, but you'll want to check that out. After exploring my newfound sanctuary, I noticed a battered staircase that seemed to lead somewhere... new. After following it for a while (and only briefly succumbing to some rather surprising obstacles), I found myself in a winding realm known as "Box Hell."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Without getting into too much detail, it's a space that more than lived up to its name—and one that eventually presented me a safe route to the other side of that troublesome mountain I had been attempting to cross before my unfortunate slip. I also encountered some other farcical delights (which I won't spoil here) along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;It was but one fleeting leg on a meandering journey, but it's indicative of how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turns the mere act of perseverance into its own reward.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe you want to conquer one specific route that has repeatedly bested you. You don't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>need</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to overcome that challenge, but you know you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>can</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Perhaps you stumbled across a frog-shaped bucket that might hold the answers to some cosmic mystery. You must take it. Oho! You spotted a glittering avocado that simply MUST be devoured with all the finesse of a Hungry Hungry Hippo. Yum.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-director-explains-the-rich-storytelling-possibilities-of-strategy-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles director on why strategy games are great for storytelling</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will your unquenchable search for purpose result in fulfillment?

Still, onwards we bumble. Schlomp. Schlomp. Schlomp. One foot forward. Then the next. Sole and mulch forever intertwined. We believe in the trudge because we must. There is meaning in this.
