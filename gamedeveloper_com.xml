Every other week, this curated overview will feature key takeaways from a vintage or classic GDC Talk with the goal of helping today's developers unearth new lessons from the past.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">creator Adam Robinson-Yu's 2020 GDC Virtual talk </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZW8gWgpptI8?si=vtIHq-4UO-xrpcl_">Crafting a Tiny Open World: A Short Hike Postmortem</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of my all-time favorite videos to show my own game design students. It truly has it all: advice on taking broken dreams and cobbling the pieces into something special, fun design tidbits, cute gifs, and an entire section on production tips for a solo endeavor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZW8gWgpptI8?si=HnOYXJWGvjsUGKLW" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a small, narrative-driven open world game where the hero, vacationing on a gorgeous mountain, needs to get to the peak to make an important call. Robinson-Yu details the game's many inspirations, including a previous RPG project, the wide-open wonder of open worlds, as in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the gorgeous colors of the Canadian forest in the fall. He used plenty of handy tools (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/deep-dive-yarn-spinner">Yarn Spinner</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) and spends a portion of the talk extolling the virtues of working within limitations, which got him towards the game's colorful, pixelated 3D look.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/marvel-rivals-introduced-a-pve-mode-to-reduce-the-pressure-of-competition" target="_self" data-discover="true">Marvel Zombies was built to give Marvel Rivals players a breather</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, comes the fun part: Robinson-Yu was able to find finishing funds (for a Humble Original launch) but he had to commit to a 3-month deadline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Robinson-Yu shows a slide here with the core game scope and "Stretch Goals" for extra features and niceties. Notably, the core game was not treated as just a minimum viable product, they were aiming for "good" here. "It would still be fun and playable if the stretch goals weren't made, but it kind of allowed me to naturally scale the size of the project to the rate at which work was actually being done."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that several of those extra features did not make the original release (though some, like secret areas and more tools, items and quests, did)—but "I think the game still worked well without them, and I ended up adding some of those for the later Steam and Itch.io release."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He was also able to add some of those tasty stretch features in later versions of the game.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Production fun for a team of one">Production fun for a team of one</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a slide titled "The Scrum Board You Know and Love (?)" Robinson-Yu extols the virtues of working under tight deadlines and thinking keenly about production process, even as a solo dev.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/crusader-kings-3-team-says-addressing-feedback-backlogs-is-like-playing-darts-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Crusader Kings 3 team says addressing feedback backlogs is like 'playing darts'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I used a simplified version of the scrum process," he says. "I would usually re-estimate all of my tasks for every week, and also at the beginning of every day. This helped me have a good sense of what features I would have time for and helped me plan ahead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think it's tempting to skip this step when you're working by yourself, but when I started doing this, I found it really useful to keep myself on track."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next slide, titled "Deadlines... misunderstood?" brandishes the infamous mug of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Majora's Mask</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s terrifying moon (a universal symbol, at least among my generation, for "deadline"). &nbsp;"I also had an external deadline to hold me accountable on this project," says Robinson-Yu. "For me, personally, that helped keep me really focused on finishing something rather than trying to make something perfect."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Robinson-Yu goes into some excellent design tips after this—with one story about a cave that I won't spoil here, but it's a banger—and leaves the viewer with some very positive and pure vibes.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unlocking the key takeaways">Unlocking the key takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you want the sparknotes version of the talk—or you're just outlining some of the major lessons in your notes—don't worry, I've got you!</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key takeaways here are: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Use smart shortcuts, and embrace your limitations. Robinson-Yu re-uses tools and assets from previous projects, and even finds a unique, appealing art style from working within his means on art and animation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is to embrace smart production methods: even when working solo. Robinson-Yu used what worked about scrum for his own purposes here, and it allowed him to finish a very robust little game in three months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
