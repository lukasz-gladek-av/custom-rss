Slurp. Tsnuff. That's what I sound like right now. Sipping my coffee after spending a week holed up in my apartment because I came down with one of the worst case of the sniffles I've had in yonks. I'm out of the woods now, which I'm sure my neighbours will be glad to hear.

It's a notable milestone given the title was maligned at launch due to widespread performance issues and bugs.

After tinkering with the technology for the best part of two years, the French publisher invited reporters to take an R&amp;D experiment called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teammates</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a spin to showcase how its Gemini-powered NPCs can purportedly enable new ways of play. Afterwards, we met with key members of the company's AI team to learn why Ubisoft is betting big on an industry that appears intent on alienating creatives by pilfering their work. Those we spoke with, however, offered a more cautiously optimistic view.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Coatsink to lay off half its staff due to &quot;challenging co-development market&quot;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/coatsink-to-lay-off-half-its-staff-due-to-challenging-co-development-market">Coatsink to lay off half its staff due to "challenging co-development market"</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via GamesIndustry.biz // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom: Two Crowns</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Islanders</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Coatsink has commenced a restructuring process that's expected to result in between 50 to 60 redundancies.

The studio has accused Valve of failing to adequately explain why the project was blacklisted back in 2023, leaving it unable to implement a fix with a view to launching on Steam. Valve said it spoke with the developer at the time, but described its decision as "final." It's a situation that has raised concerns about censorship and transparency, with Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva describing the ordeal as "scary, humiliating, and patronizing."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Steam censors LGBTQ+ content on behalf of the Russian Government"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">How Steam censors LGBTQ+ content on behalf of the Russian Government</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Video Games Industry Memo // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">To what extent is the Russian state censoring video games?
