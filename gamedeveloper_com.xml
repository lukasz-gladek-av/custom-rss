This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists for the IGF's Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at this year's IGF awards, is a collection of fifty games across several genres created by multiple different developers. It's an exploration of the 8-bit visual style that draws from modern design while also telling the story of a fictional video game company that created them all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developer caught up with Derek Yu, one of the developers that worked together to create this collection of games, to discuss the rules and limitations they put in place so that the work of several different developers would still feel like part of a cohesive whole, the thoughts that went into tying all of these works together through a fictional game studio's library of titles, and creating a sense of discovery in the player through this varied collection of games to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Derek and I was one of the indie game developers that collaborated on making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I grew up designing games on paper and eventually used </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Klik &amp; Play</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to make freeware games.

I was inspired by how we used to make small </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Klik &amp; Play</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games together as "Blackeye Software", as well as my gaming experiences in the 80s and 90s. I spent a lot of time browsing collections of games on floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and websites, and also in arcades.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We used GameMaker Studio 2 to develop the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> collects many, many different games from multiple creators together into a single cohesive (yet varied) package meant to simulate the history of a fictional game development studio, UFOSOFT. What challenges did you face in ensuring so many different works would all operate well together? What sorts of constraints/design rules did you put in place to make things feel like the works of a single studio?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/encouraging-player-creativity-in-caves-of-qud" target="_self" data-discover="true">Encouraging player creativity in Caves of Qud</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was important to find good rules that were just flexible enough to give us direction and allow us to work quickly. For a project like this, it's easy to have too many limitations or not enough. Early on, we decided, for example, that we would stick to a 32-color palette and some simple color rules, but we wouldn't be very strict on the number of sprites on the screen. We aimed for a strong authentic "vibe".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In an </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/how-far-can-you-push-this-one-idea-the-ufo-50-team-discusses-the-making-of-the-most-bonkers-and-beautifully-weird-gaming-achievement-of-2024/">interview with PC Gamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, it is mentioned that changes were made to </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barbuta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, the first game in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>'s chronology, to make it feel more like a developer's first game. How did the overarching narrative of UFOSOFT affect the design of some of the other games? The design of the collection as a whole?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the most part, we massaged the designs of our games into the right place as we went along without having to make many drastic changes over the course of development. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barbuta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was already a primitive-feeling game to begin with, but after we decided it would be UFO Soft's first game, we pushed that existing feeling even more. We always started with games we simply wanted to make for ourselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating an overarching narrative of sorts within all of the works? How do you tell the story of a fictional developer across their varied works?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-life-in-the-funky-plant-filled-world-of-starship-home" target="_self" data-discover="true">Making a life in the funky, plant-filled world of Starship Home</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We drew from a lot of references for UFO Soft's history, including real life video game history and our own development experiences. It was something that we discussed and kept in mind throughout the process, and we made efforts to draw out similar themes and recurring ideas as we worked (like overlapping characters and locations, for example). But we only tied the story together fully toward the end once we had most of the pieces (the 50 games) in place. Jon, in particular, did a lot of work tying the narrative together in that final stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the games you wanted to make for this project? What thoughts went into creating so many different play experiences? Into making sure each game felt unique in its own way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We—Jon, Eirik (Suhrke), and I—started by brainstorming game ideas and we all had a lot of ideas we wanted to try making. Later on, we were joined by Paul (Hubans), Tyriq (Plummer), and Ojiro (Fumoto), who also contributed their own ideas. Everyone on the team has their own stylistic quirks and we celebrated those differences—so it wasn't hard to make the games feel unique from one another. There was a natural instinct to draw out what made each game stand out and put that at the forefront.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Collecting these games in a single package feels a bit like downloading a library of ROMs for an old console - this sense that you're suddenly drowning in an excess of games and can idly drift through them, seeing what grabs you from names, screenshots, and play. What appealed to you about capturing a journey of discovery within </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Into capturing that particular kind of time spent delving into the unknown world of a game company or console?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That feeling of discovery is something everyone on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team cares deeply about. For me, it started with learning about games, and as I grew older, I started to get more and more interested in the history of games and their development, too. It's become a pursuit I enjoy as much as playing or making games and I wanted to capture it within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But it wouldn't feel genuine if we simply led players around the collection and pointed them at things. There had to be real exploration involved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> took a great deal of time to develop (8 years) and required many developers to make many separate games. How did you maintain your motivation and drive across the many years it took to make the game? How did you keep up creativity and mental clarity while working across multiple different games and needing to make each feel like a separate, full title as opposed to a minigame?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It really helped to work with creative people that share a similar passion for the artform. We were also passing our games around a lot, and with 50 games there was always something new to experience. One day I'd be doing some design and programming on a game I was directing and the next day I might be testing someone else's game or helping them polish the graphics. Or maybe someone would send me a build of a game that I hadn't played in a long time and I'd realize that it improved a lot! While there were a fair share of challenges over the years, the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> often felt like a very long game jam between friends inspiring each other back and forth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope the player takes away from this fictionalized snapshot of an era in game development?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying things for us has been seeing players get interested in genres or styles of games that they never thought they'd be into (or perhaps didn't know existed!). We've also seen some younger players who were not around for the 80s and 90s get interested in wanting to explore that era. We're happy any time </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sparks up excitement for games and history like that.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
