It's a question that doesn't have a singular answer. It depends on a myriad of factors (some of which—such as the current state of funding—might be outside of your control) but there are ways you can tip the odds in your favor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat with Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">we learned what sort of titles the company isn't interested in signing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we also heard how one pitch in particular won the Japanese company over immediately.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Buckley, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Truckful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer MythicOwl fired over a stellar pitch deck and budget breakdown within hours of Pocketpair </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOLO5UXeNBA-xqFNscz7ZuNTfbkp3gOzHU-ztWthijY4w9HA/viewform">issuing a call for submissions on its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The Polish studio's approach to outlining precisely what it needed to develop and launch the adventure title convinced Buckley the dev team had a complete understanding of their product, costs, and target market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You might think that's a given—but you'd be dead wrong. Buckley explained MythicOwl's method turned out to be the exception as opposed to the rule. Since officially signing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Truckful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the beginning of 2025, Pocketpair has received reams of pitches, but scant few measured up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We opened a form on our website [to accept pitches] and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Truckful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the very first pitch. It came in within the very first hour," says Buckley. "It was the very first pitch that came in the door and it blew me away with how it was laid out. Not just the pitch itself—which is a whole art form—but they also had excel sheets showcasing month-by-month [budget] breakdowns."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/battlefield-studios-launches-a-free-to-play-battle-royale" target="_self" data-discover="true">Battlefield Studios launches a free-to-play battle royale</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley explained the pitch was for all intents and purposes, perfect—so much so that it actually caused a bit of a panic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I turned to the guys in the office and said 'we're in big trouble, because how are we supposed to pick games if this is what it's going to be like?' but I can tell you, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Truckful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one in a thousand."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that exchange, we asked Buckley if Pocketpair and MythicOwl would be willing to share the pitch deck and budget breakdown to help other devs interested in courting publishers. They kindly obliged and now we can share both with you.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've bundled together a few examples from MythicOwl's budget spreadsheet for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Truckful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> below (with numbers redacted) to show how the studio presented the cost of everything from dynamic obstacles, day-night setup, UI modules, console porting, story and location design, and much more.
