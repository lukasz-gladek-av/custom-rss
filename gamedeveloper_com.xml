The agreement is being kicked-off with a single-player action-adventure title set somewhere in D&amp;D's expansive universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Stig and the team at Giant Skull are exactly the type of exceptionally talented creators we want to work with, and I’m so happy to be reuniting with him on this new project,” president of WOTC and digital gaming at Hasbro John Hight said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/world-of-warcraft-gm-john-hight-joins-hasbro-as-president-of-wizards-of-the-coast">left Blizzard</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after a 12-year tenure as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> general manager and SVP to take on the job at Hasbro in July 2024. This was four months after Asmussen </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-star-wars-jedi-director-unveils-new-single-player-game-studio-giant-skull">announced</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Giant Skull. The latter announcement conincidently fell right around the time news broke that Larian Studios, developer of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/larian-is-moving-on-from-baldur-s-gate-3-no-sequel-or-expansion-in-development">parted ways</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with WOTC. This meant that they would not be working on any follow up entries nor DLC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think [WOTC] understands how important they are to the community, and I trust they'll be treated with respect," Larian CEO Sven Vincke later said at GDC 2024 regarding the fate of the characters in the game. Many in the sizable fan following behind Baldur's Gate 3 had voiced concerns about the future of the game and its characters once Larian Studios stepped away from the property and any future additions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-lays-out-the-business-case-for-robust-game-preservation" target="_self" data-discover="true">GOG lays out the business case for robust game preservation</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian">WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next slate of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games could have some sizable shoes to fill if WOTC hopes to see success similar to that of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Crucially, there are bigger developers with more resources than Larian, and while independent developers should punch above their weight, there are specific considerations when trying to tackle an RPG with plenty permutations and intertwining systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”...I will say you're dealing with large amounts of data to contend with, so chaos and entropy will set in,” Vincke said, reflecting on the process during that earlier interview. ”You need to ensure you're ready to deal with that [amount of data and different permutations]. It's unavoidable when you're dealing with so much information that there will be a level of entropy. So, building systems to deal with that is very, very important. And so this is, I think, my biggest takeaway from it with how it all worked out for us."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/people-can-fly-blames-square-enix-for-latest-layoffs-and-project-cancelations" target="_self" data-discover="true">People Can Fly blames Square Enix for latest layoffs and project cancelations</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
