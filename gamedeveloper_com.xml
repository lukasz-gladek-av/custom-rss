The deal was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/">announced today over at GOG</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which notes that GOG will continue operating as a distinct company with the same mission: making DRM-free games available and preserving classics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a FAQ under the brief announcement, the company notes that the deal suits CD Projekt's desire to "focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands." For Kiciński's part, the co-founder noted a desire to "preserve and grow" the original philosophy behind the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In a PC market that keeps moving toward mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, he believes GOG’s approach is more relevant than ever: no lock-in, no forced platforms, sense of ownership. His goal is to keep supporting both gamers and developers, and strengthen GOG’s mission: preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The future of GOG and CD Projekt Red">The future of GOG and CD Projekt Red</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team offered a strong promise for the future. "GOG will remain &nbsp;independent in its operations. We will continue building a platform that’s ethical, non-predatory, and made to last, while helping indie developers reach the world. We’re also committed to giving the community a stronger voice, with new initiatives planned for 2026."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-halifax-workers-form-a-union" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft Halifax workers form a union</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For players, the FAQ notes that nothing will change with accounts or libraries. CD Projekt Red games will still reportedly launch on the platform, and the publisher's catalogue will remain intact there as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, funds donated to GOG's preservation work will stay within GOG and go to the same efforts.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
