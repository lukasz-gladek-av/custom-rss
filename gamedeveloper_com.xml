In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass">posting</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve put studios on the hook for delaying post-launch content, and said offering a season pass is "promising future content. You will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass, [which is] is a commitment to both players and Steam."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">when it will be ready for launch," it continued, "you shouldn't offer a Season Pass."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes only pertain to season passes specifically: in its FAQ, Valve explained how a battle pass can be "similar, but different: an in-game character or skin is already predetermined and become unlockable at specific gameplay milestones, usually depending on a player's pace. In this instance, Valve defines a season pass as developers choosing "when the content is released to [players], and that release is not based on gameplay milestones."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/respawn-makes-tweaks-apex-legends-controversial-battle-pass-changes">Apex Legends</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo IV </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">battle pass is exempt from this, but a season pass for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Borderlands 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? That needs to play by Valve's rules.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the new guidelines, season pass listings must now include a complete list of what will be bundled in, a basic description of each DLC, and the expected release date for each piece of content. Whether the date is specific or somewhat vague ("Winter 2025" or "January 2025," for example), Valve said the listing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>must </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have some kind of windowâ€”and in the event of a delay, developers can push back the season pass date by up to three months, but only that one time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve warned that if the release date has been missed, and it was not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing">directly contacted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about a delay longer than three months beforehand, it will delist the season pass from Steam and refund players for that specific DLC or the entire pass. Refunds will also be conducted if a DLC within that season pass ends up canceled.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, season passes for already-released games must have at least one DLC that is already out when it's made available for purchase. Exceptions are made in the case of pre-ordering a game's deluxe edition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More information on Steam's new season pass rules, including how to set up a season pass on the storefront, can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
