It added that in-person working will drive "efficiency, creativity, and success."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The RTO policy was announced alongside a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-is-dismantling-its-studio-ecosystem-to-become-a-more-gamer-centric-company">sweeping restructuring plan</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that will result in widespread cost-cutting, project cancellations, and studio closures.

When that happens, teams can lose a significant amount of experience and institutional knowledge very quickly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once again, Michaud-Cromp stressed there is a "broader industry conversation" worth having around RTO policies, particularly in creative fields like game development "where trust and long-term collaboration matter."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Ubisoft for comment.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
