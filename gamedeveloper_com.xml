The model is "configured to release user commands to a computer game at a time when the command correctly aligns with what is going on in&nbsp;[it,]" according to the patent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The patent's summary notes input lag is a problem for both system engineers and players, and believes machine learning could "control the computer game according to the user command in advance of the user completing the user command based on the identification."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve this, Sony is considering a sensor with a camera that captures the player and their controller, which is then used to train the machine learning program. The technology seems to primarily concern online multiplayer games, where input lag has a dramatic effect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, one application from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US445569801&amp;_fid=WO2025010132">June 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on machine learning for predicting user commands "before the input action is completed, or might be delayed after completion and processing until a later time when the command is most appropriate for release."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=EP445582640&amp;_cid=P11-M5Y9KZ-38045-1">notable patent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> centers on a physical attachment that would let players hold the DualSense controller like a firearm. The attachment's apparent aim is to be "more intuitive" for players, as the description notes some players "may lack the dexterity/motor skills" to conventionally hold a controller, and hopes the attachment "alleviates or mitigates the issue."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony previously experimented with gun-themed control schemes with two shooting attachments for the PlayStation Move, which were officially supported by a number of PlayStation 3 titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Filing a patent doesn't mean Sony will bring any of its proposed technology to market. In the past, Sony filed patents for technology such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/sony-files-patent-for-nfts-and-blockchain-technology">NFTs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and local multiplayer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-patents-local-co-op-multiplayer-for-in-person-live-events">live, in-person events</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
