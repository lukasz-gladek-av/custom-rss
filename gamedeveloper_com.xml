It is being developed by Pennsylvania-based developer Nobody Crown, and currently slated to launch in Q2 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”Our mission at Devcats is to raise awareness for cat adoption and rescue efforts through the fun, cozy, and wholesome games we create and support,” the team said in the announcement. “When developers join our team, they join this mission as well. We will continue contributing a portion of our profits, from our share of the project, to help animal causes in need.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mewgenics-has-sold-1-million-copies-worldwide" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mewgenics has sold 1 million copies worldwide</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devcats is currently signing new “cozy and wholesome projects” to the label. The team is offering services and assistance with “marketing, localization, music, game direction, and more.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brazil has steadily been carving its own place in the global video game market. In late 2023, Gamescom announced that it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-to-branch-off-to-brazil-in-june-2024">branching to the region</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> starting in 2024. Then, also in 2024, the Brazilian government </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/brazilian-government-signs-new-bill-to-foster-growth-for-country-s-devs">signed a bill</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to “foster sector growth [and] create jobs,” with the aim of giving the local game industry “more visibility and legal certainty,” hoping to “combat illicit activities and reduce tax burdens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, a survey conducted by Abragames and ApexBrazil found that the number of Brazilian studios rose by 3.2 percent in 2023. As of 2022, an estimated 13,225 developers operated out of Brazil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-">Gamescom Latam 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, multiple developers shared their experiences and obstacles working in the region. One key takeaway was that talent and passion can only take Brazil so far, noting the importance of relationships and networking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”You need to live together, work together, and see whether your company is capable of not just shipping one game-but shipping dozens. […] If you want to open a business you need to transform that passion into love to create a relationship with the market, create a relationship with people, and start building your business,” Abragames president Rodrigo Terra said at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In May of last year, Gamescom Latam </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/over-250-brazilian-devs-have-signed-a-letter-over-alleged-mistreatment-from-gamescom-latam">responded to mismanagement allegations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which were based on an open letter signed by over 250 developers from Brazil who voiced complaints about the organization seemingly failing to provide adequate support during the high-profile showcase.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sega-console-designer-hideki-sato-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Sega Console designer Hideki Sato has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, in August, Felix Falk, managing director of game—the German games industry association that owns the Gamescom brand and co-organizes the event with Koelnmesse—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-exec-surprised-latam-event-was-criticized-by-local-developers">said he was “surprised”</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to learn Gamescom Latam had been heavily criticized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, in September of last year, Square Enix partnered with leading Brazilian publisher and distributor Nuuvem to launch a new browser-based discovery platform called Spawnd. The tool allows premium game demos to be played, shared, and embedded anywhere on the web.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”Latin America is a strategic territory, full of passionate gamers and a strong bond to the Japanese culture,” said Hideaki Uehara at the time, who is the general manager of investment and business development at Square Enix. “Our first investment in Brazil reflects our belief in Nuuvem and in Spawnd’s potential to transform game discovery.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

And while that conversation has taken place over the specter of big-budget financial misfires like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/three-reasons-star-wars-outlaws-might-have-undersold">Ubisoft's </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/three-reasons-star-wars-outlaws-might-have-undersold">Star Wars Outlaws</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it turns out even studios turning out hit games like PlayStation-owned Sucker Punch Productions are worried about those expansive timelines as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sucker-punch-productions-studio-head-is-stepping-down">outgoing studio head</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and company co-founder Brian Fleming, who discussed the topic with Game Developer after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> won the award for "Best Adventure Game" at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/clair-obscur-keeps-riding-high-at-2026-dice-awards">the 2026 DICE Awards.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "These games are taking us on-or-off about five years right now," he said. "Candidly, we really wish that number was four."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we could get it down to four, that would be amazing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sucker Punch's process has certainly paid off, not just with awards but also in terms of sales numbers. Sony reported that the game "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ghost-of-yotei-outperforms-ghost-of-tsushima-to-bolster-sony-financials">outperformed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" its predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a recent financial report. Fleming said the desire to reclaim those years is about the "opportunity cost" of its developers' careers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What's the real reason games are taking longer to make?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said is that the studio has spent an "inordinate amount" of time thinking about optimizing tools and production processes, but those conversations have been "insufficient." "That is like treading water or maybe even losing a little bit of ground," he remarked. "The real secret we think going forward is going to be designing games that can be built in shorter periods of time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fleming clarified that developers shouldn't expect "episodic" games or anything of that nature from Sucker Punch, but that the studio is "thinking hard" about how its design choices influence the scope of games it produces—all with the goal of reducing its production timelines to four years (which may still feel like eons to other studios).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sucker Punch's next game will hopefully be made in four years">Sucker Punch's next game will hopefully be made in four years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't expect Sucker Punch to double its team size in hopes of producing games at a faster pace any time soon. Fleming downplayed the idea that increasing the number of people working on its games—or using generative AI tools—will solve this particular problem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't entertain the idea that growing the team is the right strategy," he said. "We feel like the number of man-years that went into [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] is what we think is the max."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This isn't about offshoring. This isn't about AI. This is about how you think about the delivered product...what it is, and what you're trying to do, and how you can do that by continuing to be a sculptor of that project and subtract away all the things that are not essential."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fleming's comments align with what we heard from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development">rank-and-file developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> last year when pressing the topic of long development cycles. Though we framed the topic as being about "poor leadership," several developers we spoke with said it was leadership's inability to firmly define the project that sometimes lengthened development times. Fleming's comments echo that sentiment, and it will be worth watching to see if his successors Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley can shape that vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, Sucker Punch leadership faced a challenge of a different kind last year when the studio </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-fires-ghost-of-yotei-artist-after-posts-joking-about-charlie-kirk-killing">fired a texture artist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for mocking the killing of Charlie Kirk. Fleming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">defended the firing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in an interview with Game File, saying that "making light of someone's murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
