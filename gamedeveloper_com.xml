It was, by all means, a successful launch for Team Cherry, an indie development team consisting primarily of three people. But the popularity continued to snowball from there.

When asked about why the dev cycle has taken this long, Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and Willian Pellen said that they've been having fun, and that the project has been a vehicle for their creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told Bloomberg. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea for the sequel came from designing a DLC that progressively grew in scope, until the team realized that it could become a separate title altogether. According to the devs, that growth continued over time—in 2022, Team Cherry featured </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during an Xbox event that promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. But that wasn't the case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we're always underestimating the amount of time and effort it'll take us to achieve things," Gibson told Bloomberg. "It's also that problem where, because we're having fun doing it, it's not like, 'It's taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.' It's, 'This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let's perpetuate this with some new ideas.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Team Cherry, maintaining the team small saved them from having to manage and delegate, even if that led to extended production time. The co-founders are joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larking, and "a few contractors" who helped with programming and testing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't want to mess with the formula and then find out it's not fun," Gibson said. "I used to manage teams in past lives. I don't really want to do that ever again."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This methodology has allowed for a distinct approach to developing a game, to the point where the team seems unaware of task-management applications. Gibson asked "What is Jira?" when prompted if they had used it at some point. Meanwhile, Pellen wondered "Is it software?" and added that the team briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated for lack of use.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
