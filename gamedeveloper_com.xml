The headlines detailing developer harassment after a major release, for the "crime" of certain inclusions, exclusions, or design choices. A showcase livestream comments section filled with hateful commentary and abusive language at specific games and teams. Reports of whole studios being laid off days after the release of a highly anticipated title. We see it every day, but what can we do to change it? Celia Hodent, a game UX strategist, believes a cohesive Code of Conduct for the industry is the answer, and it’s a lot less intimidating than many might think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hodent started her breakdown of ethics in games for Western audiences by mentioning several similar codes that exist in other parts of the world. “What is important in a code of ethics?” was the question she posed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone who has always been nervous about censorship and limitations, I was curious to know how a set of rules could make a community safer, and build better games. Her points on ethics in games genuinely changed my perspective on how such a code could make gaming and game development better for everyone.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is a Code of Ethics?">What is a Code of Ethics?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I think “code” in any capacity, I think of a list of rules. A set of guidelines that govern how people think and act. This is likely why I have perceived a code of ethics as potentially limiting to the creative process. However, Hodent broke down exactly what a Code of Ethics in games would look like. These rules would create protections for players, including safety expectations at events or within a community and security for the player both in purchasing and playing a title. It would also create solid expectations for what players purchase, putting down better rules around monetization and marketing.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/industry-wide-union-uvw-cwa-has-already-welcomed-over-100-new-members" target="_self" data-discover="true">Industry-wide union UVW-CWA has already welcomed over 100 new members</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most players are more than familiar with how predatory some live-service games can be. Loot boxes, season passes, and microtransactions plague communities, with few guidelines on how they function. Often, the only regulation present is player commentary, and even pushback from communities doesn’t always encourage companies to change or improve how they function.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, a code of ethics would create protections for developers and those making games. This would include better transparency of company values, worker protections, diversity, and impact on the environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a time where anyone can lose their job for nearly any reason, these types of protections are invaluable for those who pour their heart and soul into a company’s IP. It would also create better protections for developers in the trenches, cracking down on harassment, and promoting healthier work environments for those in the industry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/unity-claims-79-percent-of-developers-are-feeling-positive-about-generative-ai" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity claims 79 percent of developers are 'feeling positive' about generative AI</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds amazing when broken down this way, so why has it taken so long for a code of ethics to be built and used in the Western industry? Unfortunately, a combination of misinformation and perceived barriers have left many unsure about a universal set of guidelines. Hodent explained that this bias has prevented companies from engaging or even pushing back on a potential code.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Barriers Are In Your Mind">The Barriers Are In Your Mind</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I mentioned above that I had several ideas of what a code of ethics could be like in the games industry. Unfortunately, these barriers are commonplace. Hodent said that a core reason a code of ethics hasn’t been implemented is that companies believe it is too expensive, too complicated, or too overreaching to be effective. There are concerns about censorship and many believe that policing to uphold a code would lead to legal and PR nightmares.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are more benefits than we can count when trying to make the industry a safer place both for creators and players. Hodent explained that "we care about players having fun," but much of that fun has been lost in recent years as hostility and anxiety of increased.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/players-lambast-activision-after-publisher-confirms-generative-ai-was-used-in-black-ops-6" target="_self" data-discover="true">Players lambast Activision after publisher confirms generative AI was used in Black Ops 6</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These codes could ensure the safety of players and developers, but also protect businesses by managing toxicity before it starts. Hodent explained that one of the biggest financial burdens companies shoulder comes from players avoiding titles due to normalized toxicity and harassment. Safe players want to play more, and this in turn helps those making the games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In reality, these "barriers" could be opportunities if we change our mindset. Instead of thinking about a code as expensive, we could see it as an investment. We are investing in an overarching set of guidelines that everyone is meant to adhere to, creating an agreed-upon set of expectations and behaviors.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who Makes The Rules?">Who Makes The Rules?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hardest part of making a code of ethics is deciding what should be included and how it should look. Hodent explained that we need to "protect our art from moral panics," and base the content of the code on studies and evidence/science-based data. "How are games actually impacting players?" and how can we make guidelines and rules that tackle real problems, not perceived ones?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We need to define what it means to be safe as gamers around the world," she explained, stating that the best way to do this is by agreeing as a collective on true issues, creating solutions, and then supporting these solutions with resources and guidelines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality is that a code of ethics in games won't be an easy task, but Hodent believes the time is now. "Together, we can make the industry a safer and more accepting place,” she concluded, “If there is any moment where standing up for our values in this industry matters, this is it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After having my perception of this issue completely altered by her breakdown, I couldn’t agree more.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.

But while you're here, let me take the opportunity to shout out some specific plugins we made heavy use of: Super Text Mesh is how we got all the bouncy animated text in there, Rewired was an indispensable tool for setting up the gamepad controls, and (this one is kinda obscure) "Advanced Event" by ByteSheep Digital was an essential building block for making various editor tools we used throughout development.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns food and calorie counting into an array of minigames meant to simulate the challenges around dieting and how it can reshape your perception of food. Can you tell us about your process in taking these thoughts around dieting and food and turning them into a minigame? Can you walk us through this process for the design of one of the specific minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Jenny’s dieting is something that places pressure on her life in a multitude of ways and we wanted that represented properly in the game. Key to that is that there’s more than one way to “fail” at dieting: you can eat too much, overshooting your calorie budget, or you can eat too little (or in a way that’s “unsatisfying”) and end up hungry, OR you can counterintuitively do BOTH of those things at the same time. Additionally, eating is something you generally do everyday, so we needed to have a reusable mini game that wouldn’t get old too quickly. The resulting “food </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” mini game mostly emerged from trying to reconcile all those constraints. Each food puzzle piece gets a fake calorie value, but that’s unrelated to how it impacts hunger and craving (which is ultimately determined by the shape of the food) allowing for the aforementioned multitude of outcomes. Anyway, we had to iterate on it a ton before we arrived at the current design [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">].&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores the ways in which dieting attempts to turn food into a mechanical, countable process despite many difficult-to control needs and feelings within the human body. What thoughts went into capturing this battle with the self within the gameplay and the player's limited controls within the minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">There’s definitely a balance between what the player can control vs not control, but more than that, there’s a distinct contrast between systems the player is aware of (i.e. the fake calorie counting system, how hungry Jenny is) and systems that are hidden from the player. We ultimately wanted to trick the player into behaving like teenage Jenny by limiting information in this way. A lot of the hidden systems are built around the “random encounters”. Basically, the way these work is that there’s a big deck of event cards and when the player gets a random encounter it just draws a card randomly from this deck. But actions the player takes can secretly add or remove cards from this deck. For instance, if Jenny goes to bed hungry (with her guts at &lt; 50%), it’ll add a “snack attack” event to the deck where, if it gets drawn, Jenny gives into her craving and eats a big snack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Food-based games are not the entire experience as players must also carry out the protagonist's life and duties as well. What thoughts went into crafting the narrative and turning the main character's various activities into other minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dieting doesn’t end the moment you’re done with lunch. We wanted to explore the ways dieting overlaps with other aspects of Jenny’s life (how she balances it with school work, social obligations, keeping her mom off her back, etc.). To do that, we basically had to simulate the rest of Jenny’s life [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]. But even beyond that. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t just about the ways dieting “Consumes” Jenny’s life, it’s about how she jumps from obsession to obsession, piling more onto her plate with each chapter, following an arc similar to the one she followed in real life, so all the non-dieting parts of the game become more and more essential as the story proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's art style? What appealed to you about creating something playful and animated around this serious subject?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The current art style is basically the same art style I used to prototype the original mini-games. Back then, I basically tried to keep the decision-making simple: pick a limited color palette, the pencil tool in Photoshop, a few brush sizes. What mattered to me back then was getting the prototype working so I didn’t have a lot of time to focus on the art side. As I continued developing the game, the look of the art changed, too. I think most artists would agree that as they evolve themselves, so does their art style.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Kelly joined the project to help me out on backgrounds it was a really fun opportunity to see what they could do with my guidelines from the prototyping phase. Since this game has been in development for many years, you can see how the character is drawn in many different styles. It’s hard to stick to 1 style without feeling the need to redo it and I guess we just left my old art in the game alongside the new art styles. I also like to joke that the art looks like it had been made by a whole team of like 20 people when really it’s just 2 artists who have worked on the project for a number of years whose art styles constantly evolved and who felt too lazy to redo the old scenes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, why was it important to you to explore dieting in a darkly humorous way? What benefits and challenges came from looking at this subject with bleak humor?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Life’s depressing. Especially right now. Lots of things look hopeless. Don’t you want to laugh a little and make some jokes before you die? &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is actually one of my pet takes. Basically, I think art that’s completely devoid of humour is also incapable of being serious. Now I don’t mean that everything should be a comedy, exactly, but more that “humor” as “emotional lightness” contrasted with “emotional heaviness” is a really important part of the texture of any narrative. My go-to example here is that even Shakespeare’s famous tragedies (e.g. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hamlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are suffused with humor throughout even if they aren’t “comedies.” Which is just to say, when making something about a serious subject, finding humor somewhere is a very important part of telling a “real” story, for whatever that’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The itch.io store page for this game mentions that this game came about from personal experiences with dieting and disordered eating. What difficulties did you face in exploring these memories and feelings while creating the game? Did you feel that creating art around these experiences has helped you or affected you in any way? Do you have any concerns about how this game may affect others who play it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I got more emotional rereading my diary entries about my high school relationship and failing my classes in freshman year than I did about the dieting stuff. I actually feel like, as we expanded the game’s scope, formed an actual team, and turned this personal project into an actual video game, I became less attached to it, emotionally. Regarding my concerns about the subject matter, I don’t want my experiences to trigger other people who are in a bad mental space with food and how they see their body, so we put a content warning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We were definitely concerned about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being triggering or upsetting for anyone with a history of disordered eating. For that reason, we put a pretty hefty content warning at the front of the game. We also attempted a few maneuvers to detach it from “real” dieting and disordered eating while still evoking the feeling of those things (Stuff like removing specific weight numbers from the game and replacing “calories” with a fictional unit of energy called “Bites”). That said, we’re well aware that these interventions are insufficient for at least some portion of the audience, so we absolutely won’t begrudge anyone for giving it a pass!&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
