The band is best known for creating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic Adventure 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">theme, "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1BRZg0GG0A">Live &amp; Learn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," and he alleges Sega is in breach of contract over the iconic song. In addition to seeking financial compensation from Sega, he wants the court to "conclusively establish" who owns it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">December-filed suit,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Gioeli claims to have the "master recording and composition of the song," which he reportedly created and produced in his own home without any involvement from Sega. He further accuses the publisher of "exploiting and licensing" the song to over two dozen games, shows, and live performances without his knowledge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gioeli states he was first made aware of the song's presence in other media earlier this year. Game-wise, "Live &amp; Learn" has been featured in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Smash Bros. Brawl, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Smash Bros. 4, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yakuza 4 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Its inclusion in non-</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic Adventure 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">titles is as recent as 2021's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Rise </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from Capcom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since 2001, Crush 40 has become commonly associated with the Sonic franchise and made songs for later Sonic games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic Heroes </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucG0kD3pkg">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, he argued that in those instances, he and Sega reached "specific agreements" that addressed those songs' rights or master recordings, which did not happen with "Live &amp; Learn."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit acknowledges that "Live &amp; Learn" may be jointly-owned by the two parties. Should that be the case, it argues Sega's ownership would be "expressly limited to the lyrics themselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without a direct claim for authorship of the master, no control or direct involvement in the process of creating the final master recording, and no clear written transfer of the master, [Sega] has no basis to claim sole ownership of the copyright in this sound recording," the suit reads. It further cited a prior statement from a Sega attorney which noted the song's rights are Gioeli's "and not Sega's, and we have no rights to these materials."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite that and a letter from a separate Sega lawyer who called the song a "joint work" in April, Gioeli claims Sega refuses to name him an owner or give him 50 percent of the song's profits he is entitled to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johnny Gioeli's full lawsuit against Sega of America can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

The studio elected to "discontinue its development" after it was started years ago under "very different market conditions," said president Przemysław Marszał.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to him, Project 8's development started back in 2018, when "narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal." As of this past September, its total production costs came to 48.4 million PLN (or $11.8 million).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While specific team numbers were not provided, he added that half the current Project 8 team would be offered roles on other existing 11 Bit teams or "new, as-yet-unannounced initiatives...that will help fill the gap left by Project 8." One of those "highly promising" teams is working on the 2025 survival game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Alters</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite putting Project 8 game to bed, Marszał indicated assets from the would-be game could be used elsewhere for other projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why cancel it? He explained the project had "breakthroughs and setbacks," including growing delays and several critical parts of its development that were said to be "problematic." The tipping point came with Project 8's most recent milestone, whose evaluation showed "unresolved issues...that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, management reportedly "lost confidence" and ultimately opted to end the project. Had it been released, Project 8 would have been 11 bit's first game designed specifically for the console audience. While the studio has released its games for consoles in the past, those versions have typically come a year or later after their initial launches on PC. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/frostpunk-2-s-developers-didn-t-want-it-to-be-a-jackass-simulator-">Frostpunk 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for example, is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025 after its PC release back in September.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This past October, it was revealed 11 Bit quietly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/11-bit-studios-quietly-laid-off-eight-employees-at-the-end-of-2023">eliminated eight roles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> toward the end of 2023.
