"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/roblox-2024-proxy-and-2023-annual-report.pdf">Roblox boasted 68.4 million daily active users in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The company explained 21 percent of those users were aged 9 or under. 21 percent were between 9 and 12 years old, while 16 percent were aged between 13 and 16.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means 58 percent of Roblox's annual player base in 2023 was aged 16 or under.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox has repeatedly come under fire over a perceived lack of protections for those younger players. In October 2024, the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">rejected a report published by research firm Hindenburg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that accused it of lying about player metrics and downplaying child safety issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Months earlier, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Roblox's "pedophile problem" after speaking with 20 current and former employees who claimed the company was struggling to effectively curb predatory behaviour.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/live-service-game-engine-pragma-nets-12-75-million-in-funding" target="_self" data-discover="true">Live-service game engine Pragma nets $12.75 million in funding</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after those reports were published, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-adds-more-parental-overwatch-to-its-revamped-child-safety-procedures">Roblox rolled out new child safety protocols</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—including more robust parental controls—to limit access to certain age-gated experiences and prevent users under the age of 13 from communicating via platform chat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-2024-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">In its latest fiscal report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Roblox said "trust and safety" remains a priority and noted it rolled out 40 safety products and policies in 2024 to provide caregivers and parents with "control and clarity." It intends to implement additional safety features in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The BBC, however, claims it was able to bypass some safety controls to exchange messages between two fake accounts (aged 15 and 27, respectively) and suggest moving the conversation to another platform and playing more adult games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publication explained Roblox's filters initially flagged some of those exchanges, but that it found ways to reword those requests to escape detection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Baszucki felt the above incident highlighted how Roblox's safety measures actually work to protect children—largely because the BBC had to suggest engaging in prohibited behavior off-platform.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-voice-actor-dave-mallow-passed-away-at-age-76" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Voice actor Dave Mallow has passed away at age 76</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Baszucki by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yrjkl7dd6o">checking out the full report on the BBC website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
