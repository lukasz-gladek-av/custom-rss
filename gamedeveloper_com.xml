Games, in a cash and stock transaction worth $82.7 billion. It's a notable move for the entertainment industry that will make Netflix the owner of major film and television franchises such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, White Lotus, The Sopranos, and the wider DC Universe.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, a Warner Bros.

"Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-bets-against-horses-russia-bans-roblox-and-saudi-arabia-wants-the-majority-of-ea-patch-notes-33" target="_self" data-discover="true">Epic bets against Horses, Russia bans Roblox, and Saudi Arabia wants the majority of EA - Patch Notes #33</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Netflix claims the combination will ultimately offer more choice, more opportunities, and more value to consumers. The streamer said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations while building on the company's strengths, including theatrical movie releases. At the same time, it outlined plans to realize at least $2 billion to $3 billion of cost savings per year over the course of three years.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose. This also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers, enhancing viewing options and expanding access to content," reads an announcement. "A stronger entertainment industry: This acquisition will enhance Netflix’s studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production capacity and continue to grow investment in original content over the long term which will create jobs and strengthen the entertainment industry."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Warner Bros.
