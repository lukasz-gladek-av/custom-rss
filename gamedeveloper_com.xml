No more seasonal updates will launch after that period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update">wrote Square Enix in a notice to </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update">players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All online services will remain available after the "Party Goes On!" season ends. In addition, we plan to hold the Foamstars Cup, a series of in-game events named after each character."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company noted that previous season passes will be made available again to "ensure that new players can fully enjoy </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Foamstars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">." Players will be able to flit between existing season passes to obtain items they might have missed. Although Foamstars will remain playable moving forward, it's hard to read this as anything other than the title being mothballed by Square Enix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/foamstars-letter-producer-5-dec-2024">In a separate blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani reiterated there will be "no new content" coming down the pipeline and thanked players for their interest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't want this to sound like a final message since you will be able to continue playing the game. However I wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you all once again," he wrote. "Thanks to all of you, we've managed to successfully complete every update we had planned. We've been able to reach this point because of your warm support. On behalf of the entire team, I'd like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okatani expressed hope that players will be able to access </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Foamstars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for "years to come," but it's clear Square Enix has struggled to realise its vision for the project. Okatani said the development team faced "many challenges" throughout production, while the decision to turn </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Foamstars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into a free-to-play product just eight months after it launched suggested the title has struggled to find an audience.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
