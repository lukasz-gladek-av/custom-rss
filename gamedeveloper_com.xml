These decisions are forcing us to act in order to protect those who keep this company alive. Since Ubisoft's founding in 1986, it seems clear today that management has lost sight of the very driving force behind our industry: it's workers."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The unions claim Ubisoft management is now actively undermining the creativity of its workforce, the future of its studios, and the need for constructive dialogue.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They have also accused leadership of treating employees like "children who need to be supervised" with the implementation of the return-to-office mandate, and described the move as an "arbitrary decision" that rubbishes remote working agreements that have been in place at some internal studios since September 2025.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are told about responsibilities, but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management," continues the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[...] It's time for our management to understand that they cannot do whatever they want, whether with public money or the work of hundreds of people.
