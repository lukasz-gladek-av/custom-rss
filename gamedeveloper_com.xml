According to him, when new gameplay mechanics come to mind, those are nailed down first, and the rest gets built around that foundation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The tendency away from overt tutorialization is in line with this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nintendo strongly believes communication with players should happen only through the product itself," Shinichiro Tamaki, a former Nintendo hardware planner who helped in the creation of the Wii, told Bloomberg. "Imagine playing Mario and someone next to you says, 'Hey, it's fun if you stomp on this Goomba'—it would totally ruin the experience, right? Nintendo wants players to discover things on their own and enjoy that process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subtle mechanical nuances are discoveries that Nintendo wants the player to find out organically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Like, when you push the stick to move a character, they gradually pick up speed, or when you jump, the height changes depending on how hard you press the button," Takaya Imamura, who worked on franchises like Zelda and Star Fox over a 30-year tenure at the company, told Bloomberg. "It's that kind of thing that just never gets old—it just feels good to play. It's all about that direct connection between you and the game, that sense that you're completely in control."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/digging-into-the-combat-design-of-cronos-the-new-dawn-game-developer-podcast-ep-54" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into the combat design of Cronos: The New Dawn - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 54</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;A sense of novelty&quot; is key">"A sense of novelty" is key</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The interviews come weeks after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-is-well-aware-that-rising-development-costs-are-very-bad-news">Nintendo spoke</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the value of entertainment and uniqueness in front of investors. During a shareholder Q&amp;A, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company is exploring how to condense production cycles while still creating games that offer a "sense of novelty" to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am concerned that the improved performance of Nintendo Switch 2 will lead to higher game development costs, which in turn could result in higher software prices and ultimately a decrease in the gaming population," said one shareholder on the call. "What measures are you considering to address this?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Addressing the question, Furukawa explained Nintendo is "devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and lengthy of development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development. We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty," he continued.
