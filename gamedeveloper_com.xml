It's currently unclear who's leading the newest member of the PlayStation Studios familyâ€”though we do know the team comprises talent credited on franchises like Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite and Roblox.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1">In a blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Sony CEO Hermen Hulst said teamLFG is now "fully formed and ready to be introduced to the world" and is working on an "ambitious incubation project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">TeamLFG is described has having " originated" at Bungie before being spun out. Its debut title is being pitched as a "team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests," reads the blog post.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/starbreeze-to-acquire-payday-3-publishing-rights-from-embracer-subsidiary-plaion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Starbreeze to acquire Payday 3 publishing rights from Embracer subsidiary Plaion</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sony continues banging the live service drum at PlayStation Studios">Sony continues banging the live service drum at PlayStation Studios</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news that Sony has greenlit another live service project comes with the sudden demise of PlayStation live service shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and developer Firewalk Studios still fresh in the memory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">Sony initially pledged to improve </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">Concord after it floundered at launch</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but the project was swiftly torched.
