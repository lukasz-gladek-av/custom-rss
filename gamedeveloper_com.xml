To remedy the situation, Starbreeze formed a strike team of veteran developers to reshape the experience and said it must "take players' criticism to heart."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It subsequently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/starbreeze-ousts-ceo-tobias-sj-gren-with-payday-3-in-dire-straits">ousted (now former) CEO Tobias Sjögren</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after claiming it needed new leadership to execute a strategy "centered around creating attractive games on our own and licensed IPs."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can cross-platform collaborations help Payday 3 find an audience?">Can cross-platform collaborations help Payday 3 find an audience?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appraising the current state of play, Starbreeze indicated</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Payday 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is now in a position to grow after the launch of a major remedial update towards the end of 2024. The company said it has also worked to strengthen the "presence and visibility" of the franchise across multiple platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At this time of writing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of the games of the month on PlayStation Plus, meaning that during February it will be available for anyone with a Plus subscription to download and play," said Starbreeze.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The collaboration with PlayStation will contribute positively to Payday's revenue in the first quarter of 2025, but most of all, it is an incredible opportunity to let millions of people try </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is today, after 1.5 years of hard work to improve the game both functionally and content-wise."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starbreeze is also working to launch Payday experiences within other game platforms such as PUBG and Roblox. It believes those 'brand extension' initiatives will introduce the title to new audiences–including the "younger" playerbase that calls Roblox home.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing its wider project slate, Starbreeze said its upcoming Dungeon &amp; Dragons title–codenamed 'Project Baxter'–is making "significant progress" and is currently being playtested internally.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"During and after the quarter, we have ongoing in-depth conversations and game tests with potential partners to maximize the project's commercial potential, and the response has been positive," it added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starbreeze explained third-party publishing also remains a priority. "We are in ongoing discussions with developers of potential new third-party projects," it continued. "The focus is on finding titles with clear commercial potential that are long gone, or fully developed, as a project. After the end of the quarter, we added </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unseen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Swedish developer The Gang to our portfolio of third-party games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Acting CEO Mats Juhl described the fiscal year as "intense but in many ways also successful" and believes Starbreeze is now well-positioned to realize its ambition of becoming a multi-title studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have continued to strengthen the Payday brand through collaborations and enhancements, while making great progress with Project Baxter and establishing a strong foundation for our third-party publishing," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With a balanced risk profile, strong cash position and several ongoing projects approaching important milestones, we look forward to 2025. Our vision to be a leading multi-title studio is more realistic than ever, and we are well positioned to continue building value for our players and owners."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
