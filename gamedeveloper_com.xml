In other words, if you are blithely, inconceivably wealthy; a terrible person; or both; you may have had a great 2025. I don't personally know a single soul who did!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lest this indeed become a hell preamble, I will say this: it's close to a miracle that beautiful things still happened in this rotten year. Some human beings still did acts of good, despite it all.

Some creative people made work that made a difference—whether it was challenging, inspiring, or just distracted me when I needed it badly. 2025 was rotten to the core, but these games—and the teams that made them—are worth celebrating.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Seance of Blake Manor"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Seance of Blake Manor</a> (Spooky Doorway/Raw Fury)</h2><p>Via Raw Fury</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now this is how you do a spooky adventure! </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Seance of Blake Manor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> arrived right around Halloween and served up excellent, dark and gloomy supernatural mystery vibes. Set on a late 19th century Irish manor about to host a dangerous seance, the game tasks your PI player character with solving mysteries and puzzles surrounding the troubled souls seeking communion with the dead. Everyone here has a dark—or sad, or both—secret, and a hotel room to rifle through for clues (one of the greatest and most under-utilized gameplay systems of all time, if you ask me).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bryant Francis' top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Blue Prince"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Blue Prince</a> (Dogubomb/Raw Fury)</h2><p>via Raw Fury</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blue Prince</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> came at a very opportune time for me to jump in head-first to a big, strange, challenging and multifaceted puzzle box.
