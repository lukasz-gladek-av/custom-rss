Yesterday, he posted on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295">X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (formerly Twitter) that Apple hadn't approved the game's release (thanks, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/epic-ceo-says-apple-still-hasnt-approved-its-fortnite-ios-submission-suggests-its-obstructing-the-process/">VGC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We need to release a weekly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously.

The CEO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922792908693926318">response</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was as follows: "Our release planning relies on platforms supporting app developers like us releasing apps. There is no way a rapidly evolving multi-platform game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can operate if platforms use their power or processes to obstruct."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As spotted by VGC, according to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">App Review guidelines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, on average, 90 percent of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours by Apple.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Epic and Apple are still battling over the app store">Epic and Apple are still battling over the app store</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-s-new-hybrid-work-policy-requires-a-minimum-of-three-in-office-days" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: EA's new hybrid work policy requires a minimum of three days in-office</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This week's news is the latest in a series of developments around a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-v-apple-case-results-in-permanent-injunction-that-could-pry-open-the-app-store">years-long legal battle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> between the two companies to reinstate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on iOS.

Two months later, Epic claimed that its European account had been "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apple-kills-epic-games-european-dev-account-ahead-of-fortnite-s-ios-return">terminated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," which was a "serious violation" of Europe's Digital Markets Act.

The bill is set to take effect in late 2025. Back in December, the developer also secured a deal to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-secures-deal-to-preinstall-fortnite-on-android-phones-in-uk-and-spain">preinstall the game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> onto Android phones in UK and Spain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Fortnite will now return to iOS in Japan and UK next year, and EU this year! This is the new free world, from the point of view of app developers and users. Itâ€™s a big club and we ain't in it: The United States of America is still locked behind Apple's Iron Curtain," Sweeney said on X in June 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disclosure: The author of this piece has previously contributed editorial work to the Epic Games Store News section.</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-considering-to-pass-on-trump-tariffs-to-hardware-prices-and-sees-us-manufacturing-possible" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony may 'pass on' Trump tariffs to customers, is considering US manufacturing on hardware</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
