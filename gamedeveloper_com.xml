The game commerce firm has teamed with the Busan Metropolitan City (BMC) and Busan Digital Asset Nexus (BDAN) with the aim of building an Asian-Pacific (APAC) headquarters in the South Korean city.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the agreement, Xsolla will work toward making Busan into a "global hub for game development and technological innovation." This marks the company's newest international partnership 2024, as it's previously teamed with the governments of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-starts-industry-advancement-into-uzbekistan-with-development-academy-in-2025">Uzbekistan</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-and-savvy-games-set-to-launch-development-academy-in-saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to build game development academies in those countries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Busan will have a similar "cutting-edge talent development center" to provide creators with mentorship, resources, and funding opportunities. Xsolla and BDAN also intend to focus on "exploring advancements in Web3 technologies to drive regional economic and digital growth."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This partnership is a testament to Busan’s incredible potential as a center for games and technology," said Xsolla's global strategic partnerships VP Rytis Joseph Jan. "By collaborating with BDAN and Busan City, we aim to create opportunities for local talent and businesses while contributing to the economic and technological growth of the region."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, Xsolla's Busan plans do not appear to have a timetable for turning the city into a prominent game development hub. For both Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia, the commerce company explicitly stated it wanted those countries' development academies to create new jobs or be a prospective location for the larger game industry by 2030.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, this deal with Xsolla is said to "demonstrate Busan’s potential to become a global leader in the gaming and digital industries," according to mayor Park Hyung-Joon. "We look forward to collaborating with Xsolla and BDAN to strengthen our city’s digital competitiveness and foster new economic opportunities."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-pokemon-go-ai-model<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Niantic recently announced a Large Geospatial Model (LGM), which uses machine learning to "understand a scene and connect it to millions of other scenes globally." But according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/">404 Media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the LGM was possibly made by conscripting unaware players into doing the studio's work for years through games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Go</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel?hl=en">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Niantic expressed hope the LGM would "implement a shared understanding of geographic locations, and comprehending places yet to be fully scanned." It's built on the studio's Visual Positioning System (VPS), which lets players "position themselves in the world with centimeter-level accuracy" and see or place digital content in their exact location, even after they've left.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Go </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ingress </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are augmented reality (AR) titles, and collect geolocated images as players explore locations to find Pokémon or player-made art. By Niantic's admission, its VPS has over 10 million locations scanned globally from the past five years, and "receive[s] about 1 million fresh scans each week," which are collected from its games—one of which has been quite popular for nearly a decade, meaning players may have unknowingly participated in helping build its LGM.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to a Large Language Model (LLM), Niantic's model scrapes data from real-world locations, and it hopes to use the technology to "enable computers not only to perceive and understand physical spaces, but also to interact with them in new ways." And what makes its data more substantial than something like Google Maps or Street is the point of view: as Niantic notes, the data is "taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of July 15, 2024, Niantic's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy">privacy policy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirms it uses geospatial technology and player recordings to "build a 3D understanding of real-world places, with the goal of offering new types of AR experiences to our users." The feature is opt-in and can be disabled by players at any time, but appears to be a "critical component" of Niantic's goals for AR and its model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The path from LLMs to LGMs is another step in AI’s evolution," its blog concluded. "The world’s future operating system will depend on the blending of physical and digital realities to create a system for spatial computing that will put people at the center."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The games industry wants to go in on genAI, for better or worse">The games industry wants to go in on genAI, for better or worse</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI have previously come under criticism for using what or whoever they could to build their AI technology.
