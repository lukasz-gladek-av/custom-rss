In the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/playgama-lands-3-million-to-simplify-html5-game-distribution/">announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on December 3, it outlined its plans for its PaaS ecosystem, which will include a unified SDK to allow for publishing across multiple platforms, a QA tool that consolidates those platforms' requirements into a single list, and tools for monetization, marketing, and payments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playgama noted how HTML5's game market is made up of "thousands of standalone playgrounds" compared to the more centralized storefronts for Epic Games on PC and iOS or Google Play on mobile. That "fragmented" market means "leaders capture only small fractions of the global web gaming audience. [...] There’s currently no way for developers to access the entire market at once, and [we] aim to change this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our vision is to streamline distribution through a 'master key' approach, providing developers with a simple and efficient route to tap into all available platforms, languages, and markets, maximizing their chances of reaching a large and diverse audience," explained Playgama. Its PaaS ecosystem will run on its open-source </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://playgama.com/developers">Bridge SDK</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which it says simplifies game integration simultaneously across multiple platforms and is already compatible with Unity, Godot, and other engines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to transform the web gaming market and empower HTML5 game creators to effortlessly reach audiences they once could only dream of," said CEO Dmitry Kachmar. "With this funding, we’ll accelerate further improvement of Playgama’s platform for developers, expand our toolkit, and introduce advanced analytics and fintech solutions."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
