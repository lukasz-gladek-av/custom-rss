The news comes via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VOCtRanwXrA?si=ppjf30BtefyUO220">an announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> today from Xbox president Sarah Bond that the company has entered into a "strategic, multi-year agreement" with hardware and chip manufacturer AMD to "co-engineer" a number of devices, including the "next generation" of Xbox consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her description of those next-generation Xbox consoles heavily implies the company isn't restricting itself to a singular device that sits under the TV—and that future hardware won't restrict players to the Xbox store. "This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device" she stated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Breaking away from making Xbox a singular device—and opening it up to other video game stores—would be a major diversion from the conventional product strategy for video game consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier in the video, Bond specified that these future devices could be used "in your living room, and in your hands." It's entrusting AMD to build the graphics chips that will allow these devices to display advanced graphical displays—a common expectation of new console launches.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/who-benefits-from-the-nintendo-switch-eshop-discoverability-update-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Who benefits from the Nintendo Switch eShop discoverability update?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two companies are also promising to deliver "more immersive gameplay" using "the power of AI."

In 2013 it released the Xbox One, a formidable video game console hampered by early marketing that prioritized its potential as a home multimedia device and the packed-in Kinect motion controller.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would later abandon those selling points under the leadership of Phil Spencer (now Microsoft CEO of Gaming), pivoting first to a studio acquisition strategy to bolster its first-party offerings for Xbox, then folding those offerings into a subscription service strategy with Xbox Game Pass. Game Pass promised easier access to games through a subscription and making them accessible on more devices through cloud streaming (the notion that Xbox was acquiring studios like Activision Blizzard for the purpose of releasing games exclusively on Xbox consoles prompted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-triumphs-over-ftc-again-in-challenge-to-69-billion-activision-blizzard-deal">regulatory scrutiny</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over the $69 billion acquisition).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2's DLSS support may be a big part of future Nintendo games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024 it hawked this strategy under a prophetic marketing campaign called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">this is an Xbox</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," referring how Xbox games can now be accessed on a wide variety of devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the background, console competitors Sony and Nintendo dominated their respective ends of the console market.
