That's the question Greek highschooler Angelos Mako faced last year when he set out on a journey to rescue his favorite Flash game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/">Dungeon Rampage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, made by Rebel Entertainment. That journey only concluded after tracking down a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> programmer who'd long ago left the game industry...who had the only existing copy of its source code on a laptop handed down to his child.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mako's journey reflects the intense preservation effort in the world of Flash games. Ever since Adobe </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/38-000-flash-games-will-live-on-after-flash-support-dies-this-year-thanks-to-flashpoint">ended support for the animation and game-making technology</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020, thousands of games were wiped from the internet. Despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-strong-museum-and-kongregate-partner-to-preserve-flash-games">preservation efforts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> vanished into the ether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over two million people used to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Facebook every month. But after a respectable five years of life, the online multiplayer dungeon crawler was shut down in 2017. While some fans attempted to revive it in 2021 via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DungeonRampageRemakeV1">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lack of access to the game's source code proved things difficult. Now Mako and Gamebreaking Studios are bringing it back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Gamebreaking CEO Taylor Hellam, Mako contacted art and creative directors who worked on the original release, who led him to Rebel Entertainment CEO Mike Goslin. Goslin helped the teen locate the last engineer on the project who was solo-maintaining the title for three years (Hellam witheld the engineer's name out of respect for his privacy).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/over-250-brazilian-devs-have-signed-a-letter-over-alleged-mistreatment-from-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Brazilian devs publicly accuse Gamescom Latam of alleged mistreatment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was when the engineer discovered he still had a copy of the source code on a hand-me-down laptop he had given to his daughter. Mako then took the unusual step of securing the IP rights to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and contacted Gamebreaking Studios for support. Gamebreaking is now developing and publishing the revived game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reviving Flash games like ">Reviving Flash games like <span>Dungeon Rampage</span> is no simple task</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making it possible to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">back up and running has proved to be "quite an archeology project." The title was originally structured like an MMORPG, with Flash being used as a game client connecting to a server-side backend that was responsible for almost everything. When accessing the source code, the team realized the backend was written in an old C++ and PHP code that took a while to work around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve since migrated the backend to a fully containerized, cloud-based setup complete with CI/CD pipelines, so we’re able to continuously ship and test new versions at any time," Hellam told Game Developer. "The Flash portion of the game also required several updates to function properly. And getting it working with Steam required significant effort as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/with-an-ipo-on-the-way-let-s-dig-into-discord-s-revenue-strategy" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord's rumored IPO has us digging into its revenue strategy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hellam said that reviving Dungeon Rampage will require turning the free-to-play game into a premium title—one that will still receive free content updates. It's a signifier of how the free-to-play environment has changed since the heyday of Dungeon Rampage. Modern free-to-play games rely heavily on monetization models like "gacha and lootbox mechanics," as Hellam described them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio is buoying this monetization change with a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage">Kickstarter campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, meant to fund development</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the game sells, we’ll be able to set funds aside that we’ll reinvest in development, adding new content and features over time," Hellam said. "Our dream is to keep iterating on this game for many years, guided by community feedback."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers continue to foster preservation of Flash games">Developers continue to foster preservation of Flash games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flash games have been a surprisingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/flash-game-preservation-evolves-with-the-elephant-collection">robust field for preservation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

In February of this year, EA </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-deploys-command-conquer-games-source-code-to-the-masses">shared the source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for several Command &amp; Conquer games on Github, commissioning a modder named Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to help with the restoration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, preservation projects around Flash games are a standout. They're time capsules of a bygone software platform that spearheaded game developer careers, allowing the teams behind indie darlings like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/behind-i-binding-of-isaac-i-s-blasphemous-success">The Binding of Isaac</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VVVVVV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerfall: Ascension</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create prototypes and participate in game jams before their projects took off commercially.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, Flash allowed a plethora of people to enjoy games on their browsers, an accessible platform for many players who might not have owned a console or high-end PC—a newly relevant trend thanks to of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-sees-webgpu-is-a-growing-market-for-game-development">WebGPU games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which walk in the footsteps laid by Flash game developers.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
