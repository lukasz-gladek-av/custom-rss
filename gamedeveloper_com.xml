Developers do not need to disclose if they used "AI powered tools" (like code helper software) used for workflow purposes, but they do need to list any use of "AI to generate content for the game" and/or "AI content generated during gameplay." Essentially, if any generative AI content makes it into the game or the game's associated materials, developers will need to disclose it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When AI is used to create content, Valve says this disclosure counts for the game itself alongside associated material like marketing assets or the store page. Developers must fill out a text box detailing their use of the tools. For AI content generated during gameplay, developers must check a box if the game itself makes AI-generated images, text, or other content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Carless notes, the directives were significantly rewritten, presumably to offer more clarity for developers.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
