That news comes from the newly-independent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-technology-outlet-digital-foundry-breaks-off-from-ign">Digital Foundry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which discussed the topic on this week's DF Directly Weekly livestream. During the stream, senior staff writer and video editor John Linneman explained that during the team's visit to Gamescom, they spoke with "a lot of developers" that said they're unable to get Switch 2 development kits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So many of them said the same thing," Linneman said in response to a question from the livestream chat. "They want to ship on the Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions [of their games], but they can't get the hardware." Some of these developers told Digital Foundry that they were told to ship their games on the original Nintendo Switch and rely on the Switch 2's backward compatibility features to be accessible on the new console.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of June 5 2025, the vast majority of Nintendo Switch games are playable on the Nintendo Switch 2 (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOorH2XMvX5AMhokbG5BVHsrGRrgo7Ms8fIjfFokJXntjtEno7iOs">the major exceptions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being the ones relying on custom hardware). However, developing natively for the Switch 2 would help developers optimize their game for the new console's beefier hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Writer and video producer Oliver Mackenzie affirmed Linneman's report, saying that there have been "some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-us-in-wake-of-ongoing-challenging-economic-environment-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony raises PlayStation 5 price in US amid ongoing 'challenging economic environment'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were some weird inclusions as well," he added, explaining that while it's "nice" to see some independent developers have received kits, some triple-A developers aren't "necessarily in the pipeline."
