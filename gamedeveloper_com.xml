While talking about preparations for the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, as well as the company's next-gen Xbox console, Ronald said the company is working with AMD to design dedicated silicon and hardware and investing in technologies like neural rendering to bring "a new level of quality" to games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He then hinted that AI-powered features are also part of the plan for the next Xbox.
