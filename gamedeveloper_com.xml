Ubisoft will in turn be pocketing "at least" €500 million (about $559 million) of that transaction, with the remainder serving as "sufficient working capital" for the new company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news comes on the back of a brutal financial year for Ubisoft. The company reported a 20 percent decline in net bookings, only pulling in €1.8 billion during the year. Digital net bookings also dropped 20 percent to about €1.6 billion, and the normally-robust back catalogue bookings slipped 13.5 percent to €1.3 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All told, Ubisoft posted a loss on IFRS operating income of €82.6 million. It reassured its investors that it's still seeing "strong activity metrics" across the Console and PC marketplaces—but the Tencent-backed subsidiary is the center of its transformation plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some other tantalizing details of the transaction—expected to wrap up by the end of 2025—also help us assess Ubisoft's outlook. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-assassin-s-creed-maker-ubisoft-could-create-new-ip-unit-to-court-major-investors">As previously reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the new subsidiary will be granted licenses and proprietary rights to the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed series. In exchange, Ubisoft will take in a revenue-based royalty while the subsidiary takes on the development risks. Ubisoft estimates the subsidiary's annual revenue will "exceed €80 million" in the coming years, and that the company's combined value will clock in at a minimum of €5 billion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-considering-to-pass-on-trump-tariffs-to-hardware-prices-and-sees-us-manufacturing-possible" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony may 'pass on' Trump tariffs to customers, is considering US manufacturing on hardware</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft will also offer "specific shared services" to the spinoff company, indicating there will still be operational ties between "Nubisoft" (that's our nickname for it, not theirs), and the company that spawned it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is Ubisoft having a metaphorical baby to preserve the metaphorical marriage to Tencent?">Is Ubisoft having a metaphorical baby to preserve the metaphorical marriage to Tencent?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those just joining us, Ubisoft arrived at this rocky financial position after a number of high-profile fumbled releases across its many franchises.

It stated that the game delivered the "second-highest day-one sales revenue in franchise history," and it was Ubisoft's best day-one performance on the PlayStation store. The best metric it's offered is that players have spent a cumulative 160 million hours stabbing their way through feudal Japan, but for all we know that could just be 800,000 players each playing 200 hours (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that is obviously not close to a realistic number</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-promises-business-reboot-after-major-dip-in-net-sales" target="_self" data-discover="true">Square Enix promises business 'reboot' after year-over-year dip in net sales</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As its games underperformed, Ubisoft faced pressure from investors to take strong action—at one point </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tencent-and-the-guillemot-family-considering-ubisoft-buyout">even reportedly considering a buyout</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

That decrease wasn't all driven by layoffs—much of it was done by reducing hiring and not backfilling existing roles—but especially with the major studio closures, it seems those with the least agency over Ubisoft's business decisions paid the highest price.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
