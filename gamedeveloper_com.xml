"We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For context, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-acquires-i-hytale-i-developer-hypixel-studios">Riot acquired Hypixel Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in April 2020 for an undisclosed fee. Back then, the title was due out in 2021, and it had accrued 2.5 million signees for an upcoming beta. Previously, Riot had supported Hypixel as an angel investor when the studio was founded back in 2018.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The acquisition, according to the studio, meant access to a bigger budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as well as "more security" for the team and "advisory support" from a company like Riot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was until June of this year, when Hypixel announced it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/riot-shutters-hypixel-studios-and-cancels-hytale-after-a-decade-in-development">shutting down operations and ending development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">reads a post on the Hypixel website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/u-s-congressman-calls-out-alleged-ai-usage-in-call-of-duty" target="_self" data-discover="true">U.S. congressman calls out alleged AI usage in Call of Duty</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Hypixel said that Riot provided "generous severance," as well as support in looking for investors or acquirers to help carry </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> forward. Now, according to yesterday's announcement, Hypixel made an offer to Riot and "secured funding" to return to the legacy engine and original vision of the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hypixel's funding for 'the next 10 years'">Hypixel's funding for 'the next 10 years'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the studio hasn't disclosed full details about funding, Collins-Laflamme said both he and co-founder Philippe Touchette are "personally committing funding for the next 10 years." Moreover, the announcement states that there are "no investors or publishers" involved in the roadmap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, the studio wants to keep </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development "agile and flexible," trying to avoid promises the team can't keep. Hypixel plans to announce an early access date in the coming days, aiming for Windows as the main platform at launch, and it's expected to last "at least a few years." Said launch will include exploration mode, creative mode, and modding support, while adventure mode and minigames will both be available at a later date, the latter being worked on by a dedicated team.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-will-soon-enforce-age-checks-to-limit-conversations-between-minors-and-adults" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox will soon enforce age checks to limit conversations between minors and adults</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of which, the current team is composed of co-founders Collins-Falamme and Touchette, as well as technical lead Kevin Carstens and management lead Patrick Derbic. Hypixel has also rehired over 30 former developers who previously worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and plans to continue hiring "as the budget allows" and as the team finds the right candidates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has had a long and challenging journey. It's taken longer than anyone hoped, and it's changed a lot along the way," reads a closing statement from the team in the announcement. "But here we are: starting over with a 4-year-old build, a small dedicated team, a community that refused to give up, and a vision that's aligned with a new reality. This is not going to be easy. This is not going to be fast. This is not going to be perfect. But it's going to be ours. Built together: one feature at a time, one bug fix at a time, one mod at a time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hypixel began work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after the development team found success with an independent Minecraft server that attracted a large community of players. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/riot-games-leads-investment-hypixel-game-studio-1168889/">As noted by The Hollywood Reporter in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Hypixel team subsequently sought to pivot from successful mod-maker to full-fledged video game studio.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/overwatch-2-co-developer-redhill-games-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Overwatch 2 co-developer Redhill Games is making layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They managed to do precisely that with an initial investment from Riot in 2016.
