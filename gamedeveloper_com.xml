The studio responded by saying that "our job is not to use the game as an outlet for our own views, but to craft worlds that serve our players offering immersion, escape and meaning."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to GameIndustry.Biz, Bellamy echoed this sentiment. He reaffirmed his stance that taking a step back from Pride Month-related content was to avoid "backlash," as it was "controversial in a way it didn't use to be." He added that ultimately, his job is "governance and protection as much as anything else," and that "these kinds of harsh decisions" have to be made to protect the imminent future of the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/aonic-acquires-research-tech-firm-prime-insights-for-250m" target="_self" data-discover="true">Aonic acquires research tech firm Prime Insights for $250M</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If there are tough decisions to be made next year, we'll make them.

Earlier this year, Jagex developers reportedly volunteered to finish the 2025 Pride Month content in their own time, saying that it was already complete or straightforward to implement, while others proposed an in-game Pride parade which, supposedly, would not have entailed development time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The most important thing is the continuity and maintenance of our games, as well as the preservation of our players and serving our players great RuneScape experiences as we have for years," Bellamy replied. "That's the top priority, and that will always be the top priority."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CEO added that he totally sympathizes with what's being said, while adding that his priority is to not compromise the escapism opportunity offered by Jagex's games, as it can be a "very real risk" to the business.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the top of my totem pole will always be the continuity and operation of our games as apolitically as possible, because ultimately our games offer escapism to many hundreds of thousands of players every day," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellamy, an advisor for CVC Capital Partners, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/runescape-developer-jagex-is-being-acquired-by-cvc-capital-and-haveli-investments">the private equity firm that purchased Jagex alongside Haveli Investments in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, succeeded </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/jagex-ceo-phil-mansell-is-stepping-down-after-eight-years">former CEO Phil Mansell</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in March of this year.
