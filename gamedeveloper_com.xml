On January 1, 2025, subscribers will have a 100-hour "monthly playtime allowance" for members of its paid Performance and Ultimate Tiers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After hitting the 100-hour cap, subscribers can buy 15 more hours for $3 (Performance) or $6 (Ultimate). If a subscriber has up to 15 hours of unused playtime, that time will be automatically rolled over to the following month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subscription services for games often withhold what (or how) players have access to through their membership tiers, as we've recently seen with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-game-pass-may-expand-with-more-subscription-tiers">Xbox Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It acknowledged this limit will only affect 6 percent of its subscribersâ€”the other 94 percent "typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe," and will be "comfortably accommodated."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing between features and pricing will shift over time with any streaming platform, leading to a price increase (again, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-increasing-price-of-xbox-game-pass-introducing-new-standard-plan-that-ditches-day-one-access">Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), or a change to the benefits offered by a subscription tier, similar to Amazon Prime Video.
