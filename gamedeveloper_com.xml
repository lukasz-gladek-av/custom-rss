            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-shell-nintendo-finally-unveils-the-tktk-its-successor-to-the-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wait is over. Nintendo has finally pulled back the veil on the Switch 2, its successor to the immensely popular Nintendo Switch. It's currently unclear how much the console will cost, although Nintendo indicated it will hit shelves at some point in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers not privy to Nintendo's plans have been waiting on pins and needles for details of what new hardware features its next console might sport. Since the Nintendo Wii, the company has prioritized unique technology like motion sensor controls, second-screens, and portability over graphical and computing power.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a brief announcement video (embedded below), Nintendo showed a device that looks like a larger version of the Switch with a few added bells and whistles. The Japanese company didn't share concrete tech specs, but we can see the Switch 2 features redesigned Joy-Con controllers that click onto the side of the console (rather than slide), a new-look kickstand and dock, a larger display, and additional ports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with some Switch titles, but noted certain games "may not be supported or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Software announcements were also missing from today's reveal, although we did see the Switch 2 running a tantalisingly unfamiliar version of Mario Kart in both docked and handheld mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company has promised to share more details about the console at a later date.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ?si=jxaRiUUkZ9coS-XV" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speculation about the Nintendo Switch successor ran rampant over the last year, as developers, executives, and internet detectives with strong sleuthing skills tried to peel back how the company could top the surprise reveal of a portable console with detachable controllers in 2016. Today's reveal allows developers and publishers previously unfamiliar with Nintendo's plans to begin imagining what Nintendo has in store as it prepares to kick-start its next hardware cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, its primary competition was the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 line of consoles. Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming hadn't hit the market yet, and the promise of a console that could work equally well in living rooms and out on the go seemed like a big gamble.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, portability is on every manufacturer's mind, with Valve's Steam Deck, Sony's PlayStation Portal, and a slew of other handheld computers hitting the market. None of these devices held a candle to the Nintendo Switch's eye-popping sales numbers (Nintendo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-expects-the-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever">projects</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the console will hit 154.8 million units sold by April 2025), but their existence does challenge the house of Mario to stretch beyond the selling point of portability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course this is the company that gave us the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/nintendo-s-first-ring-con-game-is-a-switch-fitness-rpg-i-ring-fit-adventure-i-">Nintendo Ring-Con</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/brand-new-nintendo-labo-kits-will-turn-your-switch-into-a-vr-headset">Nintendo Labo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/">Nintendo Sound Clock Alarmo.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Even when it's not debuting new consoles, the company is regularly testing and launching new approaches to physical hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopes are riding high for the Switch 2 on multiple fronts.
