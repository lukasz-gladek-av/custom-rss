The demo provided an early look at some of UE 5.6's new open-world features in action, all running on PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second with raytracing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That includes a glimpse of the Fast Geometry Streaming Plugin, which offers a faster way to load open worlds. A scene showing Ciri exploring a bustling market town offered a look at how 5.6 handles busy environments full of high-fidelity characters and visual effects such as ML Deformer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The demo also included an early look at Nanite Foliage, which Epic says will enable devs quickly and efficiently fill scenes with dense, high-fidelity foliage. Nanite Foliage is slated for release in UE 5.7.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can watch the full tech demo below.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nthv4xF_zHU?si=SVWYbhbBU36pBXRZ" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unreal Engine 5.6 includes &quot;truly engine-first&quot; animation and rigging workflows">Unreal Engine 5.6 includes "truly engine-first" animation and rigging workflows</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-video-game-history-foundation-preserves-the-history-of-myst-in-impressive-archival-feat" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Video Game History Foundation preserves the history of Myst in impressive archival feat</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to sending the internet into overdrive with that peek at The Witcher 4, Epic also confirmed that UE 5.6 is now available for download and chock full of other features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said it made major strides towards implementing "truly engine-first" animation and rigging workflows, reducing the need for DCC round-tripping. For instance, UE 5.6 will give developers the ability to edit animations visually and intuitively with redesigned Motion Trails.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unified for both actors and character controls, you can adjust your arcs and spacing directly in the viewport; choose from styles like Dashed, Time-based, and Heat/Speed mode; and access features that include pinning, offsets, and spaces for even more precision," explained Epic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Tween Tools have also been revamped to enable you to fine-tune animation on controls or selected keys more quickly. We’ve also added new Hotkeys to control the sliders indirectly, as well as the ability to toggle between different slider types and switch into Overshoot mode. And, with the addition of the new Time Offset slider, you can create and edit with even greater control."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other experimental features will enable more in-editor rigging workflows, with developers now able to create and sculpt morph targets directly in-editor with the Skeletal Mesh Editor. It's also possible to use Control Rig Physics to add procedural physics motion to character rigs for more dynamic movement, while the addition of a new built-in rag doll physics feature within rigs can be used to create "lifelike responsive animations."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/avowed-game-director-joins-netflix-games-developer-night-school-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Avowed game director joins Netflix Games developer Night School Studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those tools were showcased during The Witcher 4 tech demo, where they were used to breathe life into Ciri's trusty steed, Kelpie.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other notable additions to UE 5.6 include an improved MetaHuman Animator capable of capturing actors' performances in real time on most webcams and smartphones, as well as from audio. New licensing options in the UE EULA will also enable MetaHumans to be used with any engine or creative software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epic claims a simplified UX/UI experience will also deliver faster workflows, smarter content organization, and quicker access to tools. It also said an enhanced procedural generation framework will help developers create worlds and manage complex scenes efficiently and with better GPU-driven performance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That really is just the tip of the iceberg where UE 5.6 is concerned.
