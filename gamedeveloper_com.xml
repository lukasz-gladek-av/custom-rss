He said this while responding to a question from fellow panelist Bob Pittman, CEO of iHeartMedia about the future of employment in a world with generative AI. "It will not reduce employment, it will increase employment," he said. "Technology always increases productivity, which in turn increases GDP, which in turn increases employment. And you know, in 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Today, we produce food for America and the rest of the world, and 2% of the workforce is involved in agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible I can't get a job as a farmer,' and employment is way up. AI is a great thing. It's a great thing for every industry. Will it create a genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of computers with a language model attached."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-lowers-ticket-prices-streamlines-pass-types-in-festival-of-gaming-reimagination-" target="_self" data-discover="true">GDC lowers ticket prices, streamlines pass types in Festival of Gaming 'reimagination'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These followed other comments where he described generative AI as a "backward-looking" technology, unable to excel in a "forward-looking" creative field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have to look at it as a tool set.

"I think we'll probably be able to create a bunch of efficiency, and we're already trying to do that. We're reviewing 200 different opportunities at any given time, but what AI is not going to do—because remember, what AI is, is the combination of big data sets with a bunch of computers within a natural LLM, a large language model. And by definition, a data set is backward-looking, while creativity is forward-looking. To the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what a predictive model is."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We have a combination of metadata with a parlor trick.&quot;">"We have a combination of metadata with a parlor trick."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The growing impact and potential of AI technologies have been a topic of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">increasing interest and concern for developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the video game industry.
