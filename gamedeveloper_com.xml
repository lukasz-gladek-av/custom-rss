Some of the game's leadership has reportedly been "put on gardening leave ahead of their departure in September."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources have said that some of the staff that's reportedly at risk, including many level designers, user research staff, plus UX and narrative writers, have spent the last few years building and training AI tools. Now, those AI tools are "basically replacing the teams," according to a source, with the copywriting team "completely removing people" due to said tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source said that centralized staff are also "being removed," which includes research and QA employees, adding that "if a resource is centralized it is being cut or moved into the production teams."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'Fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project'">'Fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The report mentions that discussions between King leadership and both unions and staff are still ongoing, spanning across the London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin offices.

King reportedly told staff that it will present a new organizational chart in September after union negotiations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an internal memo, which was reviewed and shared in the MobileGamer.biz report, King reportedly told employees that it's making several changes to get the business back to growth, with "unlocking many more AI tools" being one recent example, as well as "investing more in marketing" this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're fortunate to have many talented individuals at King. But we also have a collective problem: the size and structure of the company often makes it difficult to get things done," the memo reads. "So we plan to simplify the organization—fewer layers, fewer overlapping remits, fewer hours spent on alignment, fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, King held a talk explaining how the studio uses AI internally.
