We spoke to Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman to find out.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A viral hit made in South Korea">A viral hit made in South Korea</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman tells us that Peak took shape during a game jam between Aggro Crab and Landfall. It's a tidbit both teams had already shared, but what we didn't know is that the entire production essentially took place during a month-long retreat in Seoul. Three members of the Aggro Crab team flew out to the South Korean capital to meet with four Landfall staffers, mimicking the process Landfall undertook when developing its previous release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/frontier-yanks-generative-ai-portraits-from-jurassic-world-evolution-3-after-fans-revolt" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frontier pulls generative AI portraits from Jurassic World Evolution 3 after fan backlash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every waking moment was either working on the game or talking about the game over KBBQ and soju. We locked in. We did have to learn each other’s work styles. Like how [Landfall lead designer] Wilhelm types only the letter 'f' for every git commit message because 'it's the fastest key to press on the keyboard.' Things like that," says Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Collaboration was very natural, which was something I had to get used to as someone who's used to more rigorous production. People would just add whatever felt important or funny on a given day to the game, but with everyone's level of experience, there was a lot of trust in each other that those decisions made sense."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bUA3UHajXE?si=Hirt6_Nf4hhA6lVX" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vast majority of production took place during that four-week period starting in February 2025, which meant both teams were able to add polish "at a slower pace" when they touched back down on home soil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman explains there wasn't the need for a hard budget because it was obvious </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wouldn't cost much compared to a traditional indie project. That said, he estimates Aggro Crab and Landfall spent less than $200,000 overall—which he notes is "pretty doable" for two studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/riot-shutters-hypixel-studios-and-cancels-hytale-after-a-decade-in-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Riot shutters Hypixel Studios and cancels Hytale after a decade in development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was mainly just a couple months salaries and the Airbnb, flights, and food for Korea," he adds. The biggest challenge, says Kaman, wasn't financing or actually building the title, but rather agreeing on a direction for their initial concept. The team had taken to chatting over Discord before flying out to Korea, and that led to some combative discussions they've since come to blame on the fallibility of the written word.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we wanted to make a game about lost scouts but there were so many directions the mechanics were being pulled in. We got into a few arguments in Discord, worried that if we didn’t get it right, we would end up stuck in Korea making a bad game we didn’t really believe in," he continues. "To our surprise, things clicked shortly after meeting up in person, where we figured out this is a game about free-form climbing and managing afflictions on your stamina bar. This led to a phrase we would say often: 'text is evil.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us&quot;">"This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scope creep is another evil familiar to most developers, but Kaman explains Aggro Crab and Landfall swerved the issue by agreeing they would ship whatever they made in Korea.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-ratify-historic-contract-with-microsoft" target="_self" data-discover="true">ZeniMax union workers ratify historic contract with Microsoft</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To clarify, the game jam IS the game," he explains. "By the end of the month, the core gameplay was basically done and all that was left was to hook up the rest of the user experience, add meta-progression elements, and sneak in the banana peel. We avoided scope creep by having a built-in ship date: midsummer. I'm here now in Sweden to visit Landfall for the annual Swedish celebration, and we spent the first week of the trip putting the finishing touches on the game and launching it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was essentially in the bag, Aggro Crab and Landfall had to decide how to market and sell the title. That required both studios to place their trust in their community managers, who had spent years nurturing communities on TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we'd be able to reach our audience," says Kaman, who explains the confidence both studios had in their community managers' ability to connect with their playerbase was partly why they chose to unveil and launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the space of five days.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You only really need to announce early to build up enough hype for that initial spark, but if you already know you’ll have that, then it’s just up to whether the game is good enough to turn that spark into a raging campfire," he adds. "We couldn’t have predicted this insane of a response of course! I think the large launch discount (38 percent) and the inherent virality of the game also helped make it easy to convince your friends to all pick it up"</span></p><p>Image via Aggro Crab / Landfall</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing pricing in more detail, Kaman says launching for less than $5 made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a very tantalizing "impulse spend." He explains that most players were pleasantly surprised at the scope and depth of the title considering the low price point and confirms the both studios subsequently broke even in a matter of hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought if we were lucky it would eventually do half as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We broke even in the first few hours. Now that a week has passed we're at 1.6 million copies. It's absolutely bonkers and none of us expected it," Kaman continues. "We are freaking out. We knew we had a decent shot of success because of our platforms but this level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us. We’re attributing this win to the Power of Friendship."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, this is the second viral hit Landfall has delivered after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-nets-8-8m-players-in-two-months#">sold 2.2 million copies and attracted 8.8. million players in two months</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The reason for the discrepancy in those numbers is simple: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched as a free-to-keep title for a full day. That lead to around 6.2 million people downloading the co-op horror title in 24 hours and over 200,000 concurrent users on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Landfall and Aggro Crab considered doing something similar with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but ultimately decided it would be tough to replicate the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We found out recently that a lot of games have tried [that same approach] since [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched] and failed to hit the same level of success. We were anxious about whether we’d get results without a bold strategy like that, but this probably resulted in way more revenue than if we had done the free day," notes Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Landfall and Aggro Crab are sharing the spoils, Kaman explains both companies are taking cuts as co-publishers of the game. Each individual who worked on the project is also receiving their fair share. That sounds pretty peak to us.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
