The company's defence? Its former employees actually leaked information and that amounted to "gross misconduct."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union representatives at IWGB beg to differ, and this week staged multiple protests outside Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar offices in London and Edinburgh, respectively. Attendees brought some pretty damning signage to the picket line, which was laden with zingers like 'Grand Theft Employment!!,' 'The Pinkertons Salute You!,' and 'Union Busted?'&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IWGB is demanding that all employees caught up in the ousting are immediately reinstated and is exploring possible legal action.

According to UK union IWGB, the company fired over 30 people for engaging in union activity. Rockstar parent company Take-Two denied the allegation and said its former employee were ousted for "gross misconduct."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rockstar accused of deflecting after claiming fired union workers leaked information"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-deflecting-after-claiming-fired-union-workers-leaked-information">Rockstar accused of deflecting after claiming fired union workers leaked information</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Here's your chaser for that shot. A few days after the allegations against Rockstar were made public, the studio told Bloomberg it had actually fired a bunch of unionized employees for "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum." A spokesperson for the IWGB union subsequently informed Game Developer its members had a statutory right in the UK to engage in private conversation with union organizers that supersedes any employment contract.&nbsp;It also said the fired workers hadn't discussed any Rockstar products or titles during those conversations. Food for thought.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Game Awards' Future Class program remains on ice</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Square Enix says it wants generative AI to be doing 70% of its QA and debugging by the end of 2027"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">Square Enix says it wants generative AI to be doing 70% of its QA and debugging by the end of 2027</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via VGC // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Final Fantasy maker Square Enix has partnered with Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo to improve the "efficiency of game development processes" by leveraging AI.

Well, fear not, because EA has reassured employees that&nbsp; the $55 billion deal won't require it to sacrifice its soul. At least, not all of it. In an updated FAQ shared with workers (made available via an SEC filing) the company said it will "maintain creative control, and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact" under its prospective new owners.

After delaying the inaugural event until 2027, the IOC confirmed it has now parted ways with organizers in Saudi Arabia. It's unclear why, but the IOC said the decision was "mutual." I wonder whether it had anything to do with the Saudi regime's human rights record, which according to multiple advocacy groups is nothing short of abysmal.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo Planning 'Consistent Release Cadence' For More Video Game Movies, Following Super Mario Galaxy and The Legend of Zelda Films"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-planning-consistent-release-cadence-for-more-video-game-movies-following-super-mario-galaxy-and-the-legend-of-zelda-films">Nintendo Planning 'Consistent Release Cadence' For More Video Game Movies, Following Super Mario Galaxy and The Legend of Zelda Films</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via IGN // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Would you believe it?

A Legend of Zelda live-action flick is in the works alongside sorta-sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and now Nintendo has told investors it wants to create a framework that will facilitate a "consistent release cadence" of would-be blockbusters. Chris Pratt will be off his nut.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo upgrades hardware forecast after Switch 2 tops 10 million sales"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-upgrades-hardware-forecast-after-switch-2-tops-10-million-sales">Nintendo upgrades hardware forecast after Switch 2 tops 10 million sales</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 doesn't know the meaning of the phrase 'sophomore slump.' Mainly because it's an inanimate slab of technology devoid of consciousness, but also because it stormed out of the gate to sell over 10.3 million units in less than four months. For context, that means the long-awaited Switch successor has almost match the lifetime sales of the ill-fated Wii U, which sold 13.56 million units in around four-and-a-half years.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
