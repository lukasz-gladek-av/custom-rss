Last year, Microsoft's goal was reportedly in the 70 to 80 percent daily usage of AI on general tasks. Sources claim that the goal for this year was to get up to 100 percent, so that every developer, including managers, would have to use AI daily.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT," a source told MobileGamer. "King leadership is in general quite AI skeptic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This policy would differ from one reported at other Xbox Game Studios subsidiaries. During an interview at Gamescom LATAM, Compulsion Games founder and studio head Guillaume Provost told Game Developer that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/compulsion-games-boss-says-internal-xbox-studios-aren-t-facing-generative-ai-mandate">Microsoft isn't demanding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its first-party teams leverage the technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Just based on the types of games that we make, I would say we are probably not the studio that will use AI the most, and I don't think that bothers anything at Microsoft," Provost said.
