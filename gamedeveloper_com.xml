The most prominent are "advancing" generative AI (gen-AI) with "4D object creation," where the fourth dimension is "interaction," as well as real-time voice chat translation, which adds upon real-time text chat translation, which was released in February 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first item refers to an open-source 3D foundation model to create 3D objects and scenes on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which the company has been </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-open-sources-3d-cube-model-in-first-launch-of-genai-tools">tinkering with</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since last year. Roblox claims that the use of gen-AI will enable interaction between objects, environments, and people, providing models with built-in functionality, such as a car that can be instantly driven and has doors that open. A "limited release" is slated for Q4 this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second item aims to, starting next year, allow players who speak English, Spanish, French, and German to enable real-time voice translation when speaking through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> voice chat system.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Roblox claims AI tools will help creators &quot;get from idea to shared reality faster&quot;">Roblox claims AI tools will help creators "get from idea to shared reality faster"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the company, the other three tools are aimed at speeding up processes, such as text-to-speech and speech-to-text application programming interfaces. An example of this includes NPCs being "brought to life" by enabling creators to incorporate narration and character dialogue "instantly" using the text-to-speech API.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/blizzard-asks-overwatch-general-manager-to-steer-mobile-and-live-service-efforts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Blizzard asks Overwatch general manager to steer mobile and live service efforts</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our goal is for developers to have the opportunity to transform their ideas into growing businesses," said Nick Tornow, Roblox senior vice president of engineering. "Time and again, we see that when we give our creators powerful tools and opportunities, they create things that inspire us by pushing the boundaries of creative possibility. At Roblox, better tools, including many with AI capabilities, will help creators get from idea to shared reality faster."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's worth noting that generative AI tools are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-2025-state-of-the-game-industry-devs-weigh-in-on-layoffs-ai-and-more">increasingly generating skepticism</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> among professional game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amidst the company's ongoing push for AI tools, Roblox continues to expand its user base and the scope of what's present on the platform.
