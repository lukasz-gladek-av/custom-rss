It serves as a warning to developers, publishers, and advertisers who leverage the monetization method.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those companies will now have three months to review and amend their storefront listings before the CAP and ASA begin taking action against rule breakers. In a statement to press, the ASA said it has already seen a number of cases where the presence of loot boxes has not been adequately disclosed on app store listings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ASA said relevant companies have a few months to "get their houses in order" before it takes action, which may include a formal investigation and advertising ban.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/tiktok-refuses-to-axe-racist-ai-generated-ads-for-finji-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tiktok refuses to axe racist AI-generated ads for Finji games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From 26 May 2026, we’ll begin actively monitoring app store listings and will take targeted enforcement action if we see the rules aren’t being followed," said the regulator.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our guidance explains that simple wording like 'includes random-item purchases' or 'contains loot boxes' are likely to be enough to make clear that a game involves loot boxes. But this needs to be in a prominent place—people shouldn’t have to click, expand tabs or scroll through long descriptions to find this information."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ASA and CAP </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.asa.org.uk/resource/guidance-on-advertising-in-game-purchases.html">updated and republished its loot box guidance in 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to prevent consumers from being misled about the inclusion, cost, and impact of in-game purchases.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Enforcement Notice focuses on app store listings because the ASA feels they are the "final point of decision before a game is downloaded."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At that stage, it’s vital that people are able to clearly see whether a game includes loot boxes, so they can make an informed choice. However, the same rules still apply to ads in other media," said the regulator. "We've already banned a number of ads that failed to mention the presence of loot boxes in games and we’ll continue to investigate and take action where necessary."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CAP compliance executive Joseph Cahill said it remains vital that consumers are given key information upfront about the kinds of in-game purchases they will encounter after purchasing or downloading a video game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This Enforcement Notice sends a clear message to the industry: if a game contains loot boxes, this must be made clear to players before they download or buy it. Where advertisers fail to meet those standards, we won’t hesitate to take action," added Cahill.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Call of Duty ad banned in the UK for trivializing sexual violence</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
