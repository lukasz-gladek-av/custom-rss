"An Australian court just found that Apple and Google abuse their control over app distribution and in-app payments to limit competition. There are 2,000+ pages of findings that we’ll need to dig into to fully understand the details. This is a win for developers and consumers in Australia."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's another notable win for Epic, which earlier this year announced that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/fortnite-returns-to-the-app-store-in-the-u-s-after-five-year-absence">returning to the App Store in the United States</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> following a similar victory over Apple in U.S. court.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epic began legal proceedings against Apple in Australia in 2020 after the iPhone maker blocked </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> updates when Epic attempted to let players make in-app purchases via its own third-party payment service.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After we added direct Epic payments to save players up to 20 percent, Apple and Google retaliated by blocking </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players from installing and updating the game through the App Store and Google Play," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia">said Epic in a lengthy post on its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied-with-the-launch-phase-remedy-says-fbc-firebreak-struggled-on-steam" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Commercially, we were unsatisfied': Remedy says FBC: Firebreak underperformed on Steam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Apple and Google demand that game developers use their payment processing service, which charges an exorbitant rate of 30 percent. Apple and Google block developers from using more efficient payment methods such as Mastercard (including Apple Card), Visa, and PayPal, which charge rates of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, and therefore prevent developers from passing the savings on to customers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epic described the policies used by Apple and Google as "restrictive" and "anticompetitive."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Federal Court judge Justice Jonathan Beach agreed (to an extent) and found that Apple and Google's store dominance reduced competition and resulted in developers paying higher fees than they would on a more open marketplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.afr.com/technology/federal-court-finds-apple-google-anticompetitive-in-fortnite-app-fight-20250811-p5mm2f">As reported by Financial Review</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Beach noted Apple and Google don't impose similarly restrictive rules on applications that sell other goods such as food or transport. He also found that "Apple's centralized in-app system for the purpose of security does not entail that there is not a substantial anticompetitive purpose involved."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach, however, quashed Epic's claims that Apple and Google had breached consumer law. Apple welcomed that particular outcome but said it "strongly disagreed" with his other rulings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lineage-developer-ncsoft-establishes-casual-mobile-division" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lineage developer NCSoft establishes AI-driven casual mobile division</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate.
