Unfortunately, our application was unsuccessful. This means we do not currently have ongoing funding to support our organization, and there are no relevant and available opportunities for Freeplay on the horizon," reads the post.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As such, we are unable to continue paying our co-directors a salary to run Freeplay events, and there is no guarantee we can operate beyond 2026.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are currently operating with our volunteer board steering the ship whilst we arrange plans for our slated events this year. Based on the resources we currently have, Freeplay is likely looking at its last year of operation for the foreseeable future."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Freeplay organizers claim video games are no longer being prioritized by local government&nbsp;">Freeplay organizers claim video games are no longer being prioritized by local government&nbsp;</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-assassin-s-creed-boss-sues-ubisoft-over-alleged-disguised-dismissal-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Assassin's Creed boss sues Ubisoft over alleged 'disguised dismissal'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Festival organizers claimed Freeplay's failure to secure funding via Creative Victoria (which is backed by the local government) is indicative of a shift away from video games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’re disappointed in the outcome and what it implies about how games are currently being prioritised by the Victorian Government," they added. "Of the 81 arts organizations supported by Creative Enterprises in the 2026-2029 funding round, none are games/interactive arts organizations."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creative Victoria previously awarded Freeplay two years of organization funding in 2023. That covered the day-to-day costs of running the festival and the hiring of two part-time co-directors.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, with the festival at a crossroads, organizers have turned to the Freeplay community for advice on how to chart a path forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are at a crossroads, considering what this means for Freeplay’s future. Freeplay has been a cornerstone of the Australian games community for over 20 years, and if its time is up, we refuse to let it disappear without a bang," the post continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[...] To help us decide the best path forward, we would love input from the community.
