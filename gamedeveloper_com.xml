In it, Bellamy stated that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RuneScape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Old School RuneScape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not be running any 2025 Pride Month content, so that developers could instead focus more on “what players wanted.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers reportedly volunteered to finish said content in their own time, saying that the work around the event was either already complete or straightforward to implement. Others also proposed an in-game Pride parade which, supposedly, would not have entailed development time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On Tuesday, April 29, Bellamy, alongside the company’s chief people and culture officer Keeley Vaughan-Davies, hosted a Q&amp;A session to address staff concerns. During the session, Bellamy reportedly said that the reality that we find ourselves in is “changing,” and that is getting “more troubling, less moral” in his opinion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-agreement-with-major-studios-that-includes-ai-guardrails-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: SAG-AFTRA suspends strike and instructs union members to return to work</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Games and studios are being canceled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative,” he continued. ”The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellamy confirmed that the Pride mini-quest in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Old School RuneScape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is being discontinued for 2025, while the Tales of Pride event will be present in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RuneScape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but without newly developed content. Community-organized Pride marches will be allowed to continue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reasoning behind the decision is to “ensure the business is protected against those that would wish us harm,” and that the content is “now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jagex employees sent an open letter to management on May 15, asking the executive team to commit to annual, seasonal Pride events for both games, and to restart development on new Pride content for 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On May 22, Jagex reportedly responded to the letter, saying that “our job is not to use the game as an outlet for our own views, but to craft worlds that serve our players, offering immersion, escape and meaning.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Jagex is the latest publisher to step back from visibly supporting DEI and LGBTQIA+ groups">Jagex is the latest publisher to step back from visibly supporting DEI and LGBTQIA+ groups</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As pointed out by PinkNews, even though Jagex is a UK-based company, it is currently owned by US-based private equity and investment advisory firm CVC Capital Partners. According to its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cvc.com/portfolio/our-portfolio/?strategy=all&amp;country=United%20States&amp;industries=all&amp;cardName=null">portfolio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the firm shows partnerships with 26 US companies. An anonymous Jagex employee reportedly told PinkNews that by discontinuing Pride events, Jagex is “catering to American conservatism.”In recent times, companies such as Take-Two have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-dei-lgbtq-removal">removed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mentions of LGBTQIA+ support efforts from investor reports, even altering messaging in comparison to previous years, as reported by Game File. Meanwhile, someone at Activision reportedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-looks-like-someone-at-activision-is-leaking-slack-screenshots-to-right-wing-x-users">leaked</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> internal Slack messages to right wing users after staff pressed the company about maintaining support for DEI and LGBTQIA+ groups. In a statement addressed to PinkNews, a Jagex spokesperson said that the studio is “a strong supporter and ally of the LGBTQ+ community, with a firm belief that our games should be a safe space for all our players and celebrates people of all identities.” In the statement, the spokesperson said it was a “difficult decision” to pause work on new in-game Pride content for 2025. In addition, the studio is “working with our internal DEI committee to explore broader, more meaningful ways to celebrate Pride across Jagex, including possible partnerships and charitable support.” Lastly, the spokesperson said that the studio’s goal is to “listen, learn, and find better ways to support all players and employees.
