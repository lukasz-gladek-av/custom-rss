The features, which are centered around giving parents a remote way of monitoring and managing their children's activity, include options for playtime, visibility into what kids are playing, approving extra playtime requests, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the app, parents will be notified what game a child is playing in real time via notifications. They can opt to restrict certain games if they so desire, as well as accept or decline a child's request for extra playtime. Parents can also access daily and weekly activity reports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other features are less game-oriented and involve the overall experience of children using a PlayStation 4 or a PlayStation 5. Parents can manage spending activity by adding funds, viewing balances, or even setting a monthly spending limit for a child to make purchases on the PlayStation Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also content filters, which parents can choose and configure to decide on age-appropriate content. The company says that it has included presets that "automatically apply recommended settings for different age groups," but every setting can also be customized individually. In addition, there are also options available to customize privacy settings and how children connect and play via social features.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/testronic-confirms-closure-of-madrid-and-belgrade-studios-affecting-4-point-8-percent-of-the-total-workforce" target="_self" data-discover="true">Testronic makes 4.8 percent of its total workforce redundant, closes Madrid and Belgrade studios</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PlayStation joins Epic and Roblox in the recent parental control moderation tools spree">PlayStation joins Epic and Roblox in the recent parental control moderation tools spree</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recent examples of increased parental control include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/parental-controls-for-nintendo-switch-2-and-nintendo-switch-overview-faq/">the app for the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which parents can use to restrict new features like GameChat, as well as filtering the download and use of certain content.

Regarding the latter, a Testronic spokesperson told Game Developer that they're unable to share investment data and disclose the figure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, Testronic confirmed that—as part of the restructure—the company has closed down its studios in Madrid and Belgrade, while the Catalis Group name has been "retired."
