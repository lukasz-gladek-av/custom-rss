We’re not using it to generate anything. I think there’s an element of artistic intention that is essential to what we do and what others do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game director went on to remark that “human intention is what makes things special,” and that’s “where we want to be.” Currently, it seems the interest is on using AI around big data tasks as well as “long-term player analysis.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ishtar-games-told-to-pay-damages-for-illegally-terminating-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ishtar Games told to pay damages for illegally terminating workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Howard, the technology can’t be ignored. “You can’t ignore it, in terms of it’s coming, it’s changing, every few months there’s a new model, particularly in the tech side with code or productivity or other things.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He continued: “I would just say that we’re looking at that stuff, we’re not fully ignoring it, because where it can help us get better at some big data tasks that just take us a lot of time, that we just wish were done now, so we can move on to the creative stuff, that’s kinda where our heads are.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bethesda joins a growing list of studios under Xbox that have spoken about the use of AI, a technology that the company isn’t exactly ignoring. In August of last year, Xbox touted the new console's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-have-ai-powered-features-that-will-transform-gameplay">“AI-powered features” that will “enhance gameplay,”</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> albeit without providing examples.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2025 alone, Activision Blizzard used AI to generate promotional images of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-is-using-generative-ai-to-hawk-games-that-don-t-exist">games that didn’t exist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then, Compulsion Games said that generative AI usage is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/compulsion-games-boss-says-internal-xbox-studios-aren-t-facing-generative-ai-mandate">“not mandated”</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at Xbox, while adding that it is “probably not the studio that will use AI the most.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In July, a report indicated that Candy Crush maker King, also under the Xbox banner, had laid off around 200 employees. Some of those employees had been </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-candy-crush-maker-king-is-allegedly-replacing-employees-with-internal-ai-tools">allegedly replaced by the internal AI tools they had designed themselves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A month later, another report suggested that Microsoft had issued an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-king-s-leadership-is-sceptic-about-microsoft-s-ai-mandate">AI mandate for King</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to anonymous sources at the time, Microsoft’s goal for workers during 2024 was reportedly in the 70 to 80 percent daily usage of AI on general tasks. The sources claimed that the goal for 2025 was to get up to 100 percent, so that every developer, including managers, would have to use AI daily.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lyrical-games-announces-full-financing-publishing-deal-with-the-chinese-room" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lyrical Games announces full-financing publishing deal with The Chinese Room</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to one of the sources, at the time, AI adoption was “very low” apart from ChatGPT, and that King leadership is generally “quite AI skeptic.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, in September, developer leads at ZeniMax Online Studios said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-elder-scrolls-online-co-lead-says-studio-really-doesn-t-use-generative-ai">the team “doesn’t really use” generative AI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, while recognizing Microsoft’s interest in the technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”I mean, obviously we’ve looked into it,” studio game director Rich Lambert said at the time. “Microsoft has got their big push for AI. But we don’t really use a lot of it right now. I use a lot of it for meeting summaries and whatnot, because it just makes my life easier. It helps organize my inbox and stuff like that. But we don’t have a ton of it right now.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
