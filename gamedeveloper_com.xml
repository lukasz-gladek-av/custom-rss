Rosen founded Rosen Enterprises. in 1954, first specializing in selling Japanese art and and photo booths before pivoting to the import and export of coin-operated "amusement machines."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 1965 Rosen Enterprises merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, a company formed by Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg and James Humpert to inherit the assets of their prior firm Service Games (the first two letters of each word being the origin of "Sega"). Rosen became CEO of the new venture, laying the groundwork for one of today's most enduring game development firms.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rosen helped steer Sega through acquisitions and industry shifts">Rosen helped steer Sega through acquisitions and industry shifts</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experts like Sega Mega Drive Collected Works author Keith Stuart </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies">have said</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Rosen was skilled at identifying and recruiting business visionaries with an eye for the future of game development.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/unity-signs-multi-title-development-partnership-with-2k-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity signs 'multi-title development partnership' with 2K Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Under his watch Sega expanded as a manufacturer and distributor of arcade games, eventually being bought by Paramount Pictures parent company Gulf+Western Industries.

One major data point: the sweet spot for selling your game might be between $20 and $40.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamesight concluded this by analyzing "hours to convert" for games in different genres and at different price points. "Hours to convert" represents the average amount of time between when a player learns about a game to the moment they purchase it. The report suggests that if your premium game is priced between $20 and $40, players will take about 130 hours to acquire your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That may seem like a lot, but Gamesight also reports that this is only a 17 percent increase over the amount of conversion time needed for free-to-play games, which clocks in at an average of 111 hours.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Games over $40 face the stiffest challenges when converting players">Games over $40 face the stiffest challenges when converting players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The literal lower cost of entry makes it a useful baseline for measuring other price points. Games that cost over $40 have an average conversion time of 217 hours, and games priced between $0 and $10 have an average conversion time of 142 hours.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-sells-1-million-units" target="_self" data-discover="true">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles sells 1 million units</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games that cost between $10-$20 have an average conversion time of 133 hours—close to the $20-$40 mark. But Gamesight noted that with the average median game price now at about $15.64, this may mean there is "increasing competition from indie games at lower price points." Aiming higher with your game's price could help you stand out from the crowd.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But of course, don't count on your price alone to get people interested in your game. "Channel strategy, not pricing, determines performance," the report notes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more insights on how to better market your game—like the impact of improving your Steam user scores and selecting different marketing channels—consider reading </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamesight.io/reports/form-performance-marketing-report-Q1-2026">the full Gamesight report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
