Many a journalist in 2025 gave a nod to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a novel take on the Tycoon genre grounded in the classic newspaper business with a particular focus on the way teams turn breaking news into front-page stories.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s the attention to smaller processes that makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shine. Keeping researchers and writers comfortable and undistracted in their work environment through noise and mess management is key to getting quality work out of your team. The reporting process is nuanced, allowing players to chose different angles to best suit their intended audiences, which themselves vary depending on which neighborhood of 1930s New York you’re focusing on. Factions add an ethical element, reminding you that you’re not reporting in a void and that the words you print have an impact on the power balances within the world around you.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brings together many familiar elements of other Tycoon games while borrowing some from other niches within the management sim genre, blending all into a cohesive and only sometimes chaotic experience borne out of real-world systems and processes. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>- Alissa McAloon</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

The product of hard-working creatives who continue to pour themselves into an industry that feels more hostile by the day.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you connect with a game, you're having a conversation with the people who made it.

Baby Steps offers nothing of the sort. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In fact, the punishing walking simulator actively tells players to avoid pursuing perceived goals. Do not spent hours climbing that crumbling tower. There is nothing at the top. No magical item. No life-altering vista. Nothing.

Eight squads become six. Six become four. Four become two. Until, finally, a victor emerges. The fast-paced tournament format works wonders in tandem with Battlefield 6's kinetic gameplay, which feels all the more intense in close quarters.

The sequel immediately drops players into the middle of a murderous revenge arc and maintains a welcome sense of urgency throughout. It's also far more generous where combat and exploration is concerned, letting players tune their playstyle with a wider variety of weapons, tools, and armour kits that demand mastery. It's all wheat and no chaff, and that's precisely what I crave these days.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lumines Arise"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/">Lumines Arise</a><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/">&nbsp;</a> (Enhance, Monstars Inc. / Enhance)</h2><p>Image via Enhance</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris Effect</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> remains an absolute all-timer and one of my comfort games, so you can imagine my delight when Enhance announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a spiritual successor that takes the studio's own block-busting puzzler and ponders 'what if you were playing this in the middle of the Berghain?'&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-famed-developer-vince-zampella-has-passed-away-at-age-55" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Famed developer Vince Zampella has passed away at age 55</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer is, of course, 'that would be fucking mint.' &nbsp;Sometimes you just want to lose yourself and play a proper Video Game.
