Google will charge a 20 percent fee on in-app purchases that provide "more than a de minimis gameplay advantage, and a 9 percent fee for other purchases like in-app subscriptions and purchasing premium games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Google can still charge another fee for transactions that take place through Play Billing, though developers will now be able to include alternative payment options that can be shown side-by-side with Google's in-game purchasing platform. They would be free to set different prices for transactions on alternative platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a compromise on Epic's part.

"The explosion for really amazing new games, which we're already seeing and it's gonna continue growing markedly, it's going to put the importance of AI-driven discovery ever more in the forefront."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's reasoning is that Unity is in a position to help developers and publishers sort through what is a difficult market, because there will be "so much more content" in an already competitive marketplace. "We think we have a role to play in helping our customers take advantage of that growing path," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is related to a previous remark during the earnings call, in which the CEO spoke about Unity's goal for the democratization of game development that can allow individuals to "build a game that millions of people can play," after mentioning recent examples of Unity-made successful titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/peak-has-surpassed-4-5m-sales-within-a-month">4.5 million sales within a month</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ball x Pit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which sold over 400,000 copies on its first week (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT/status/1981449708787659090">via the official account on X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), amid others.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-collect-the-data-and-share-the-data-how-can-game-companies-support-women-with-leadership-ambitions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Collect the data and share the data:' How can game companies support women with leadership ambitions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, Bromberg posited that we're seeing a "kind of next turn of the wheel" now, in which "AI technologies are gonna allow us to make that game development process ever more accessible," adding that these tools will allow developers to spend less time "mired in the start line" of building features and functionalities to spend time "innovating" instead.

This increase was driven by "strong performance of the Unity Ad Network, powered by Unity Vector."
