In terms of specific cities and areas, Ontario had 638 game development firms, followed by British Columbia with 426 and Quebec with 338.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The majority of studios are small and Canadian owned">The majority of studios are small and Canadian owned</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the report notes, 97.4 percent of the video game businesses operating in the country in 2022 were Canadian owned. Moreover, 77.5 percent of the grand total were smaller studios with fewer than five employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's worth noting that foreign-run companies, which the report says tend to be relatively larger businesses with 20 or more employees, generated more revenue than Canadian companies in 2022—$4 billion versus $3 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two other notable metrics include that one in four employees in the Canadian game industry are women. According to the report, the figure saw an increase of 17.8 percent in 2013 to 24.5 percent in 2021, while the shared paid to women increased from 14.4 percent to 20 percent.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/avalanche-closes-liverpool-studio-laying-off-31-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Avalanche finalizes Liverpool studio closure, lays off 31 workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted by Statistics Canada, women's employment share is growing more rapidly than women's compensation share, likely the result of industry newcomers occupying entry-level positions with lower salaries.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Studio Closures slowed from 2014 to 2021">Studio Closures slowed from 2014 to 2021</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second notable metric from the report involves entry and exit rates—meaning, businesses opening and businesses closing shop. As per the report, entry rates for video game companies in Canada were higher from 2014 to 2018 but lower from 2019 to 2021, which is relative to all private employer firms. Then, from 2014 to 2021, exit rates for video game firms were much lower than those for all other private employer firms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conclusion by Statistics Canada is that studio closures in the Canadian video games industry are "relatively rare."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sadly, as we've seen in recent years, that metric appears to be changing. Sure, multiple companies have set up new studios in the region, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/people-can-fly-opens-montreal-studio-to-expand-triple-a-production">People Can Fly</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/avalanche-studios-opens-new-montreal-studio">Avalanche Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but despite the growth many workers have been caught in layoffs and studio closures.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-korea-they-are-the-joe-pesci-of-countries-unknown-worlds-co-founder-compiles-plan-to-take-on-krafton-in-newly-surfaced-litigation-help-document" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Korea - they are the Joe Pesci of countries,' Unknown Worlds co-founder compiles plan to take on Krafton in newly-surfaced 'Litigation Help' document</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2023, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-montreal-hit-with-layoffs-amidst-larger-company-reductions">Ubisoft Montreal laid off staff</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> amidst larger company reductions, affecting the Quebec branch as well.
