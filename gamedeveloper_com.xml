However, he could not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>name </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">said studio in the interview, and described it as "um...in Manchester, that did the driving game for Xbox."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bizarre, which is located in Liverpool, developed the Project Gotham Racing games for the original Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles. Activision Blizzard bought the studio for an initial $67.4 million, with an additional $40 million if certain benchmarks were hit over the next five years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From 2008 to 2010, Bizarre released four games—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, Geometry Wars: Touch, Blur, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>James Bond 007: Blood Stone</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—before its shutdown in 2011.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kotick went on to discuss a "really good guy, who was running the day-to-day," whom he could not name, but appears to be then-studio head Brian Woodhouse. He considered Woodhouse "brilliant," but said Bizarre itself was an "$80 million" acquisition overall, and was subsequently written off two years later. "Everything about it violated all our principles."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nonetheless, he noted his former company's acqusition strategy was to buy companies for their proprietary technology, IP, or "history of profitability." Keeping a studio's management and ensuring that company still had its independence was also considered a stark contrast to a studio like EA, which he said would acquire a developer and replace the original name with its own branding.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kotick's comments are bizarrely upfront">Kotick's comments are bizarrely upfront</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">High-level video game executives often speak warmly about the studios they've acquired, and talk up the potential value they can add to the publisher's portfolio.
