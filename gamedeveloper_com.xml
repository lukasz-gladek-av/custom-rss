Last week a federal judge rejected the company's motion to dismiss a plagiarism lawsuit filed in late 2024, saying the third-party footage and documentation of older </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> content it submitted was not sufficient evidence to establish copyright ownership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit, initiated by writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau, accuses Bungie of plagiarizing elements of a science fiction story he posted on Wordpress from 2013-2014. He argued that content from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s "Red War" and "Curse of Osiris" campaigns from 2017 lifted elements from his work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to a court filing obtained by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">The Game Post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Bungie filed to dismiss the case, submitting 13 hours of fan-captured </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> footage links to the fan-run wiki "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.destinypedia.com/">Destinypedia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" as evidence of its original authorship. The developer stated in its motion that it was relying on third-party documentation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because the two campaigns, Red War and Curse of Osiris, are not currently playable on public or private versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is due to the company's practice of "content cycling," where older </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> expansions are taken offline to maintain game balance and not overload the amount of content the studio needs to maintain. (Bungie went so far in its filing as to say the Red War and Curse of Osiris campaigns "can no longer run" because their code is "incompatible" with Destiny 2's current underlying framework."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-sold-to-valnet-many-staff-laid-off" target="_self" data-discover="true">Vox sells Polygon to Valnet in a blow to video game market</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Judge Susie Morgan rejected the motion on May 2, 2025, saying the third-party material does not validate the company's claims to copyright ownership.

It instead emphasizes that the plaintiff's complaint covers the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not the submitted third-party evidence, and that the length of the submitted materials does not afford the court time to review the material that it might in a traditional discovery process.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gta-vi-has-been-delayed-until-2026-but-now-has-a-firm-release-date" target="_self" data-discover="true">GTA VI has been delayed until 2026 but now has an actual release date</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Even if the Court had access to a complete version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this case would require a much more complicated side-by-side analysis than those conducted in the caselaw cited by Defendant," Morgan wrote, responding to Bungie's reference of cases like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/5131075/gottlieb-development-llc-v-paramount-pictures-corporation/">Gottlieb Development v.

This has allowed lawsuits like one filed against Apple and director M. Night Shyamalan by a director named Francesca Gregorini to proceed to a jury trial. Gregorini had accused Apple and Shyamalan of copying her 2013 film The Truth About Emanuel in the making of the Apple TV+ show Servant.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-is-placing-bets-in-the-cloud-and-ai-not-so-much-games-or-hardware" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft's Q3 report shows slight Xbox growth as fresh price hikes loom</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gregorini's lawsuit had been initially dismissed, but that dismissal was reversed by an appeals court that ruled "reasonable minds could differ" on if the two works were similar, and that the discovery process could "shed light" on the facts of the case. A jury ultimately decided that Shyamalan and Apple had not infringed on Gregorini's copyright in January 2025, maintaining the high bar that plaintiffs face in proving copyright violation (a high bar Martineau still has to clear in his case against Bungie).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Hollywood Reporter noted that decisions like this have led to more copyright suits against Hollywood producers located in states covered by the Ninth Circuit.
