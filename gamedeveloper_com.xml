Yoichi Erikawa founded Koei Tecmo alongside his wife Keiko Erikawa in 1978. Back then, the company was simply known as 'Koei' and focused on personal computer sales.

Hisashi Koinuma will subsequently lead the division as representative director, president, CEO, and COO.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that leadership shift on the horizon, Koei Tecmo will initiate an absorption-type company split to establish Koei Tecmo Corporate Finance as a new subsidiary.
