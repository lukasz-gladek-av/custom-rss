It's already sold its two game IPs, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pixel Worlds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiny Troopers, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to Social First. The studio itself still exists, but will pivot to another industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piipari revealed its struggles with the two, now delisted properties: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pixel Worlds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has failed to be "commercially viable" in recent months, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Troopers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is licensed to a separate developer and publisher. As such, Kukouri made the "difficult decision to close down all game operations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At time of writing, no layoffs have been reported, and Kukouri's next moves are unknown. Its now defunct developer website reads: "Thanks for all the years."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who is Social First?">Who is Social First?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social First, the new steward of Kukouri's former properties, is made up of former staffers from the Finnish studio. Its own game, the Early Access title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nexus Station, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has been billed by PocketGamer as a successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pixel Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Founder/CEO Kim Soares told the outlet the decision to acquire </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pixel </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiny Troopers' </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">rights</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"was an easy one. [...] Many of the Social First team have been working at Kukouri on either or both of these IPs earlier in their career, including myself. We wanted to secure the IPs from Kukouri, as they are legacies of many of our team members."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers spinning up their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-gearbox-publishing-devs-form-new-publisher-cooldown-games">own studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to carry on the spirit of their former employer is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/disco-elysium-writer-launches-third-splinter-dev-summer-eternal">nothing new</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but not all of them wind up acquiring the properties they once worked on. For the moment, Soares hasn't disclosed anything about what's in store for either property. However, he did say these acquisitions won't change Social First's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nexus </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">focus "in any way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pixel Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had one of the best online communities I have ever seen in my career of 25 years in game development, [and] we really hope to see that community come together again in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nexus Station.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
