As such, Tencent claimed Sony has failed to allege facts that would justify exercising personal jurisdiction over Tencent Holdings, which is a foreign company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in China. It suggested that alone is sufficient grounds to dismiss all of Sony's claims.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants— about the unreleased video game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Light of Motiram</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony's game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its spinoffs," reads the filing.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-elder-scrolls-online-co-lead-says-studio-really-doesn-t-use-generative-ai" target="_self" data-discover="true">New Elder Scrolls Online co-lead says studio 'really doesn't use' generative AI</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property.

for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Jan-Bart Van Beek, explained that the game's core conceit—an intrepid, red- haired woman navigating the ruins of a shattered civilization overrun by robotic beasts—had already been executed by a different video game studio in the 2013 title Enslaved</span><span
