It has also denied that it chose to delay the title to avoid paying the previously-agreed earnout, and alleges that Unknown Worlds' leadership team were replaced because they essentially downed tools.

They say </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received "high marks" during extensive pre-release play testing—spanning thousands of hours—and was primed to launch in early access in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They note the title had 2.5 million wishlists on Steam, purportedly making it the "second most anticipated PC title in the entire world." It's a situation that most publishers might dream of—but one Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill claim made Krafton "go nuclear" in a bid to delay that success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The promise of such immediate and enormous success presented a problem for Krafton," reads the suit. "Certainly, it eventually wants the game to drive revenue. But a blockbuster [redacted] launch—squarely within the earnout period—would likely trigger the $250 million earnout to the studio's former owners and employees."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;2025 is the ideal commercial release window for release&quot;">"2025 is the ideal commercial release window for release"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, they say Krafton CEO Changhan Kim told Unknown World leaders that an early access launch would be "disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing" for Krafton.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So Krafton engaged in a months-long campaign to delay </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">release. It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks," continues the lawsuit.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/santa-ragione-says-apple-is-delisting-wheels-of-aurelia-without-justification-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Santa Ragione says Apple is delisting Wheels of Aurelia 'without justification'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Multiple Krafton employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purpose of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement's prohibition on taking actions for that purpose. Even in the face of these pressure tactics, Unknown Worlds refused to delay the launch. The game was (and is) ready for early access; [redacted] 2025 is the ideal commercial release window for release."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Unknown Worlds seemingly pressing towards that 2025 early access release, Krafton is accused of terminating the contracts of Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill "without cause" and seizing control of the company.

Cleveland states his title changed from 'CEO and Design Director' to 'Franchise Creative Director' to relieve him of the administrative tasks required of a chief exec so he could focus on Subnautica's "cross-media expansion."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sega-netflix-and-others-will-let-roblox-creators-monetize-their-major-franchises" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sega, Netflix and others will let Roblox creators monetize their major franchises</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All three founders assert they "maintained an active role with Subnautica 2—driving its overall creative and commercial direction and supervising the day-to-day leads." It's a statement that seeks to counter Krafton's claims that all three "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lengthy lawsuit ultimately posits that Krafton has "thrown its promises out of the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community" in the name of its bottomline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All three founders are seeking a judgement awarding the full payment of the earnout under the Equity Purchase Agreement and any other damages proven at trial.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath#content=query:film,pageNum:18,indexOnPage:0">You can read the full lawsuit on Scribd</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
