Software sales dipped by 24.4 percent year-on-year to 123.98 million units over the same period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That downturn resulted in consolidated net sales tumbling by 31.4 percent to 956.2 billion yen ($6.15 billion) over the past nine months. Profits fell by 41.9 percent to 237.2 billion yen ($1.5 billion).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Digging into those numbers, Nintendo said titles released during the current fiscal year delivered "steady" sales. That includes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Party Jamboree</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which sold 3.91 million copies and 6.17 million copies respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also benefitted from the longevity of catalog releases like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which sold 5.38 million units over the past nine months.

The company now expects the Switch to sell 11 million units by the end of the current fiscal year–down on the 12.5 million units it previously forecasted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has also lowered its full-year software sales forecast by 6.3 percent to 150 million units.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo highlights Switch player count with hardware and software in decline">Nintendo highlights Switch player count with hardware and software in decline</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite that revision, Nintendo said the Switch is "still being purchased by many people" and now boasts 129 million annual playing users.
