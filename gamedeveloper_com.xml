"There are already scouts from publishers here. The publishers nowadays are very surprised and excited about the quality of games coming from Asia—China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. They are looking that way, and not necessarily this way. But I was here three years ago and the number and quality of the games is much higher now."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Draw inspiration from their own culture&quot;">"Draw inspiration from their own culture"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the attention does shift, Yoshida encourages developers in emerging markets to "draw inspiration from their own culture" to craft something that feels completely singular.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," he says. "That was developed in Canada but could have been made anywhere. But some games in these regions—like Asia, India, or the Middle East—draw their inspiration from their own culture, whether it's mythology, food, music, or even history. That leads to the creation of something that could have only been authentically crafted in these regions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump funding cuts 'devastate' video game research and development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"My game of the year last year was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nine Sols</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from a developer in Taiwan.
