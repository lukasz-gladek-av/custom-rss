As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Naoki Hamaguchi told Game Developer, adding the new interpretation of the story was deliberate to maintain player interest over time, considering that this remake treatment of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is split into three parts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to keep the players' interest in our game, but in order to do that, we can't simply just add new elements, that won't be enough," Hamaguchi said during an interview at Tokyo Game Show. "We wanted to add a new interpretation to the story, entirely new story elements, things like that to, again, sustain the player interest and have players look forward and be curious to the conclusion of the remake trilogy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When working on a remake, Hamaguchi said he first tries to think what the original players have in mind. In this case, what they loved about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are parts he didn't want to alter or change and decided to keep as is, but there were others that the team wanted to create something new for the modern generation of players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, there are clear expectations in mind, which the team took into consideration to preserve that interest. For context, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched in April 2020, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> following in 2024. Via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">IGN</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Square Enix said that the company is hoping to ready the third and final installment by 2027.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-director-explains-the-rich-storytelling-possibilities-of-strategy-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles director on why strategy games are great for storytelling</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About Aerith...">About Aerith...</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Obviously, when we look at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I think a lot of users were interested to find out what's gonna happen to Aerith and her fate," Hamaguchi said. "So because of that, we tried to create a game and depict the story in a way where players won't be able to tell what's going to happen to Aerith until the very end."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, with the team working on the third entry, the director thinks that players will be interested in knowing what's going to happen with Meteor, for example, as well as the overall conclusion. When asked if retaining player interest was a motivation for the boldest changes to the story, Hamaguchi said that it's hard to describe it as is. Rather, it was about ensuring success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The key for this project to succeed is to determine what kind of changes we would want to bring in order to sustain the player interest throughout the remake trilogy," he said. "Without determining where we want to change some things up in terms of the story, it's kind of hard to ensure that the project succeeds, not just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the entire remake trilogy. So we're sort of trying to push boundaries in that sense and trying to figure out what kind of bold changes we can bring to the story, but we're also trying to make careful decisions around that."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-yacht-club-games-is-staying-retro-with-its-most-ambitious-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Yacht Club Games is breaking new retro ground with Mina the Hollower</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
