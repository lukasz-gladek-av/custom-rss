            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video game studio sustainability is a tough nut to crack. Projects can have extremely high up-front costs—often funded by investors or publishers—and generate the bulk of their revenue in the short window after release. That means there are long periods where studios burn overhead while little money comes in. The problem is exacerbated if a publisher has a high revenue share or loans need to be paid back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing that equation is a key task as the game industry looks to recover from years of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">mass layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-closes-the-initiative-and-cancels-its-perfect-dark-reboot">studio closures,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> especially for triple-A studios. IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak says there's one strategy that's helped the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> studio become stable: deliberately producing sequels with lower budgets than the original game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Abrak laid out this strategy in a late-November conversation with Game Developer while discussing IO Interactive's ongoing live support for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The studio drives interest (and revenue) through regular updates, including its celebrity-driven "Elusive Target" missions. But before it could enter that cycle, it had to produce the three Hitman games now united under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> banner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do so, Abrak said the company deliberately produced 2018's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and 2021's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on lower budgets than than 2016 game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which cost about $70 million (Abrak previously disclosed these budget numbers on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemakersnotebook.libsyn.com/exploring-the-world-of-hitman-with-io-interactives-hakan-abrak">Game Makers Notebook podcast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "The investment in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">2016, the start of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a sizable investment," he explained, noting the company maintains its own bespoke game engine called Glacier. "But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which had a higher Metacritic [score] took half of the time and cost almost half of the budget" (around $40 million).He said the sequel was also a bigger commercial success, driving higher returns for IO Interactive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/independent-game-festival-freeplay-warns-its-days-could-be-numbered" target="_self" data-discover="true">Independent game festival Freeplay warns its days could be numbered</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is in contrast to other triple-A projects at companies like Sony Interactive Entertainment, where sequels like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost more than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-the-last-of-us-part-ii-i-and-i-horizon-forbidden-west-i-cost-200m-each-to-make">double their predecessors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to produce despite existing gameplay and technological foundations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was then produced in just under two years, earned the highest Metacritic score of the three games, and cost $20 million, close to a quarter of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s budget. "That's the philosophy—the initial investment is very important and is risky, but how you build on the revolution of that, of making an exciting competitive product, instead of always thinking 'oh, I need to reinvent the revolution every time.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-assassin-s-creed-boss-sues-ubisoft-over-alleged-disguised-dismissal-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Assassin's Creed boss sues Ubisoft over alleged 'disguised dismissal'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="IO Interactive's sustainability journey had plenty of speed bumps">IO Interactive's sustainability journey had plenty of speed bumps</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IO Interactive "building on the revolution" of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> culminated in a choice not available to many developers—binding its three games into effectively one product, creating a kind of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron">Voltron</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game that benefits from regular updates. It's an innovative approach that's not necessarily available to all studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And while it's true that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost less than their predecessor to develop, the studio faced other hurdles along the way.

The studio </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-hitman-i-developer-io-interactive-makes-layoffs-to-secure-future">laid off several developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and scaled back the scope of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after losing key financial resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The transition from the Hitman trilogy to the new collected </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> collection also came with trial and error. When </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> debuted on PC exclusively on the Epic Games Store, IO Interactive wasn't initially prepared to let players who'd purchased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Steam access promised content.
