One major data point: the sweet spot for selling your game might be between $20 and $40.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamesight concluded this by analyzing "hours to convert" for games in different genres and at different price points. "Hours to convert" represents the average amount of time between when a player learns about a game to the moment they purchase it. The report suggests that if your premium game is priced between $20 and $40, players will take about 130 hours to acquire your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That may seem like a lot, but Gamesight also reports that this is only a 17 percent increase over the amount of conversion time needed for free-to-play games, which clocks in at an average of 111 hours.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Games over $40 face the stiffest challenges when converting players">Games over $40 face the stiffest challenges when converting players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The literal lower cost of entry makes it a useful baseline for measuring other price points. Games that cost over $40 have an average conversion time of 217 hours, and games priced between $0 and $10 have an average conversion time of 142 hours.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-will-soon-turn-some-hisense-smart-tvs-into-an-xbox" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft to turn some Hisense Smart TVs into an Xbox</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games that cost between $10-$20 have an average conversion time of 133 hours—close to the $20-$40 mark. But Gamesight noted that with the average median game price now at about $15.64, this may mean there is "increasing competition from indie games at lower price points." Aiming higher with your game's price could help you stand out from the crowd.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But of course, don't count on your price alone to get people interested in your game. "Channel strategy, not pricing, determines performance," the report notes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more insights on how to better market your game—like the impact of improving your Steam user scores and selecting different marketing channels—consider reading </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamesight.io/reports/form-performance-marketing-report-Q1-2026">the full Gamesight report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
