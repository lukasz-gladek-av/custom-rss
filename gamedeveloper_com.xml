"Regional Pricing offers users prices that are more reflective of their local economy, rather than paying the same price regardless of where they are," the company said in its announcement. "For example, without Regional Pricing, users in Vietnam or Brazil would pay the same price as users in the United States to access an experience’s economy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With Regional Pricing enabled, prices are automatically optimized for each user’s local economy and updated periodically as Roblox’s virtual economy—and the global economy in the physical world—shifts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The invocation of Vietnam and Brazil's currencies can help developers calibrate their understanding of why items and experiences may appear to cost "fewer" Robux in other countries. In Brazil, one dollar is worth about 5.8 Brazilian real. These currency differences can make goods priced against the US dollar more expensive in these regions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palworld-dev-says-ark-survival-evolved-titanfall-2-and-other-games-invalidate-patent-lawsuit" target="_self" data-discover="true">Palworld dev says Ark: Survival Evolved, Titanfall 2, and other games invalidate patent lawsuit</a></p><p>Image via Roblox Corporation.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the example shared by Roblox, an item priced at 199 Robux in the United States might cost 139 Robux in Brazil.

"Users using a VPN to access Roblox from a Brazilian IP address would not have access to Brazilian pricing," a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spokesperson said. "Users who access Roblox from a VPN will be shown the default (highest) price for in-game items.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ensuring fairness and preventing misuse are our top priorities for this tool. By using a variety of signals to determine a user’s location, we are mitigating the ability of users to manually update their location to take advantage of lower prices. Users where we cannot confidently determine a true location will be shown the default global (highest) price for in-game items."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-switch-2-dodges-tariff-price-increase-but-accessories-will-experience-price-adjustments-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 dodges tariff price increase, but accessories will experience 'price adjustments'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faces a far bigger challenge in driving so much spending on its app: the public perception that the company has been slow to respond to what users and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">analysts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> say is a lackluster enforcement of safety regulations that put minors at risk of exposure to sexual abuse on the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last November the developer rolled out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-adds-more-parental-overwatch-to-its-revamped-child-safety-procedures">new tools to help parents control</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> what their children see and hear while playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
