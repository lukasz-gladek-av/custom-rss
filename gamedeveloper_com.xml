Genie is not a game engine," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[...] I think there will be a moment in time where that will become more defined. It certainly doesn't replace the creative process. And I would say, look, I mean, it looks to me more like a procedurally generated interactive video at this point. There are limitations and Google has said as much. So to compare the technologies, I think there's really no way to do that because they're so far apart."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;There are so many more elements to game development that go beyond world creation&quot;">"There are so many more elements to game development that go beyond world creation"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even without accounting for the fact that Genie's virtual worlds crumble into digital sludge in seconds, Slatoff stressed what some people are evidently forgetting: there is more to a video game than a character gliding through an ramshackle environment cobbled together by tool that is only capable of replication as opposed to creation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are so many more elements to game development that go beyond world creation. And the question is what is the world creation? So even beyond world creation, there's everything else that's involved," continued Slatoff.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's the storyline, there's emotional connection, there's vibe, there's mission structure. All of those things you cannot capture through AI and certainly not through a world builder. So that's just a very, very small component of what we do. And if this tool bears out, it will make a component of what we do all that much better and more efficient."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-announces-fortnite-collab-program-to-bolster-store-sales" target="_self" data-discover="true">Epic Games announces Fortnite collab program to bolster store sales</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take-Two itself has been vocal about its support of generative AI tools, with CEO Strauss Zelnick explaining the company is "actively embracing" the technology to "drive efficiencies" and "reduce costs."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That isn't changing any time soon.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to investors during the company's latest earnings call, Zelnick said he hopes that generative AI will one day become a creative force.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Just a reminder, our strategy has three parts: be the most creative, be the most innovative and be the most efficient company in the entertainment business.
