In the dead of night, the company updated the store's top games chart, and now displays games ranked by "highest sales for the past few days" and not "most downloads for the past two weeks." It wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3X6nDoGNfPc?si=xUNgqoJokQsQI9uq">YouTuber GVG</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> happened to spot the change that anyone took notice, and developers who've spent years building audiences on the eShop scrambled to understand how it would impact their game. Storefront visibility is a key driver of financial success in the digital age, and the quirks of every different platform from Steam, to PlayStation, to the Nintendo eShop all have developers trying different sales strategies at different times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 only a month away, it's notable that Nintendo would shake up how it displays games to players. Developers are counting on the new console to not only </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">deliver better performance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but to also serve as a gateway for players to jump from first-party to third-party titles. In fact many third-party developers were front-and-center during the Switch 2 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-shell-nintendo-finally-unveils-the-tktk-its-successor-to-the-nintendo-switch">reveal in April</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a subtle shift from the Nintendo Switch debut that drove excitement for first-party titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2's DLSS support may be a big part of future Nintendo games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But who benefits from a change like this?

It's also introducing a content recommendation system called "Game Finds For You."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both these changes, said Omdia analyst James McWhirter, help address what he called "the biggest threat" to Nintendo's generational transition: bringing over 15,000 Nintendo Switch titles to the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop. Nintendo needs to balance its promise that most Nintendo Switch games will be compatible with the Switch 2 while avoiding overpromoting what may be perceived as "low quality" games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Changing the eShop ranking criteria from sales volumes to revenue will stop much of this content from surfacing on Switch 2, where Nintendo has already set in place measures—including the platform-wide "Switch 2 Edition" program—to favor positioning of higher-value Switch 2-branded content," he said. "The knock-on impact is going to be [fewer] opportunities for developers of lower-priced software to reach players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pointed to "breakout" Switch games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Exit 8</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suika Games</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games that may not rank as high under this new system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless offered a similar outlook, saying the change will stop a lot of the eShop "slop" that's released on sale at 90 percent off from dominating the charts. He called this "good," but added "it'll also be trickier for cheaper games to get high up the charts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and publishers behind cheaper games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stand a chance of ranking high if they can still move high volumes of units, but as No More Robots publisher Mike Rose told Game Developer, that may favor companies with the ability to do "huge short-term marketing blasts, the size we can't compete with."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's decent reason for small developers to worry, but with other discoverability options on the way, Rose said he's waiting to pass judgment. "It feels like there's always methods for fiddling with the eShop a bit, so we might just need to work out the new ways," he said with a laugh.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course the unknown curveball in all of this—how the surprise Trump Administration-imposed tariffs, already </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-switch-2-dodges-tariff-price-increase-but-accessories-will-experience-price-adjustments-">driving up the price of accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, could impact player purchasing power in the months ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa TechTarget.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
