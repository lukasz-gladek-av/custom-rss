The lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and an absence of appeal pathways leave creators with no clear path to compliance or recourse," reads the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games that feature consensual adult content, including queer, kink-positive, or romantic narratives, are easily targeted under vague or overly cautious enforcement, often forcing developers into silence or self-censorship because platforms fear perceived risks associated with hosting legal adult content."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-cloning-horizon-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony files lawsuit against Tencent for allegedly cloning Horizon series</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="IGDA warns against allowing third-parties to influencece &quot;which stories can be told and sold in games&quot;">IGDA warns against allowing third-parties to influencece "which stories can be told and sold in games"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The group also expressed concern that financial institutions have been permitted to influence "which stories can be told and sold in games" with minimal transparency or accountability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It said the situation is essentially a form of "creative suppression" that could result in developers preemptively self-censoring or abandoning projects out of fear of removal. It also noted that "queer, trans, femme-identifying, and POC developers may be disproportionately affected by overreaching censorship."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our advocacy focuses specifically on developers creating consensual, lawful, and ethically-developed games, and we support clear, consistent content policies, not vague or overly broad censorship," continues the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games, like any medium of artistic expression, can explore themes of intimacy, pleasure, trauma, or identity. When created ethically and distributed legally, these works deserve to be evaluated fairly, transparently, and contextually, not swept aside due to stigma or third-party pressure.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-make-it-political-how-can-the-brazilian-game-industry-establish-itself-on-the-global-stage-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Make it political:' How can the Brazilian game industry establish itself on the global stage?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Many of these same games already follow established rating systems and content warnings, including ESRB and international equivalents. Developers are using existing tools to clearly communicate content, set expectations, and responsibly age-gate their work. The issue is not a lack of safeguards, but a lack of proportionate, informed, and transparent enforcement."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The IGDA has issued a set of policy recommendations it wants platform holders to consider adopting to avoid driving developers towards grey-market distribution, including the publication of clear guidelines that "distinguish prohibited content from lawful adult expression" and the formation of advisory panels with legal experts, marginalized creators, and trust and safety professionals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game platforms have also been implored to explore using alternative payment services including "including adult-industry-compliant processors" such as Verotel and CCBill.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We urge platforms, payment processors, and industry leaders to engage in dialogue with developers and advocacy organizations. We welcome collaboration and transparency. This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games," it added in a call to action.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-posts-new-adult-content-guidelines" target="_self" data-discover="true">Itch.io posts new adult content guidelines</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Furthermore, we call on peer organizations and publishers to stand with us in protecting ethical creators from harmful overreach.
