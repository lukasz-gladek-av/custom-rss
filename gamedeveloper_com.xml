Now, Godot 4.5 adds screen reader support to Control nodes, as well as screen reader bindings to customize the behavior of any type of Node. In short, it makes it so existing screen readers, which can recognize a button on screen and read its label out loud, can now be used in projects developed using Godot when implemented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to an announcement, the screen reader support feature is "quite new," and its integration remains in an experimental phase for now. As such, screen reader support for the Godot Editor itself is not complete yet. Rather, it's only implemented for the Project Manager, standard UI nodes, and the inspector.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The internationalization live preview feature allows developers to preview translations directly from the editor viewport, which is aimed at helping test GUI elements in multiple languages in a faster manner. Relatedly, developers can now switch the editor language on demand, making it so that changing the editor language no longer requires an editor restart. This is helpful for editor plugin developers to test their translations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/obituary-marvel-s-spider-man-2-accessibility-engineer-patrick-thor-gass-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 accessibility engineer Patrick 'Thor' Gass has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement notes that over 400 contributors were involved in the new feature release.
