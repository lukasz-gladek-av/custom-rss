The model generates objects in fully functional 3D, and Roblox Corp. hopes its open sourcing will "enable researchers, developers, and the broader AI community to learn, augment, and advance 3D generation industry-wide."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="More AI tools for Roblox Studio">More AI tools for Roblox Studio</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox Corp. also unveiled several AI creation tools to be used in conjunction with Cube. Its Mesh Generation API can be used inside Roblox Studio (the company's ecosystem and content creation engine) to enter text prompts that generate objects to be used in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">experience. The API gives developers fewer "time-consuming" mesh generation steps to go through, and lets them "try new ideas without over-investing time or resources."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For players, the company says the Mesh API "opens the door to a new wave of creativity by millions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> users, making gameplay even more custom and interactive. When users create their own items within experiences, that also unlocks greater engagement, which benefits developers as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ice-Pick Lodge founder Nikolay Dybowski departs Pathologic dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the Text Generation API implements text-based AI features like narration or voice commands into experiences, enabling a "prompt-and-response" dynamic between players and the open-source LLM running the prompt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox Corp. teased future AI tools would encompass "highly complex scene generation" and ultimately grow into a "multimodal model, trained on input including text, images, and video" capable of integrating with its preexisting AI tools.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
