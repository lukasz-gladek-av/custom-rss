As Fares pointed out, there haven't been any announcements, call for nominations, or application process rolled out for a Future Class of 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So is the Future Class program wrapped up? No, but it does not seem there will be any honorees at this year's ceremony. In a statement to Game Developer, Future Class organizer Emily Bouchac explained that the organization is "currently focused on providing value to [its] existing class in and around TGA this year," adding that the organization will "evaluate next steps for the program after this year's show."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bouchac did not explicitly confirm or deny if there would be a 2024 Future Class cohort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-game-awards-future-class-highlights-50-people-shaping-the-future-of-the-game-industry">began recognizing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the Future Class of game developers and advocates who represent "a diverse group of builders, thinkers and dreamers whose voices elevate and diversify the artform of gaming and whose passion makes the industry stronger" starting in 2020.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-game-awards-future-class-highlights-50-people-shaping-the-future-of-the-game-industry" target="_self">The Game Awards' Future Class highlights 50 people shaping the future of the game industry</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Inductees have been recognized annually in an onstage ceremony, with some spotlighted in video segments sponsored by companies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/dT2t3gJcBiI?si=7-7hryrsJC0Excur">Old Spice</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Outside of the ceremony, they were also promised resources and networking opportunities with each other and prominent developers in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But with no Future Class of 2024 in sight, its participants are left wondering where the celebration has goneâ€”and what does it mean for the kinds of developers it promised to help?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is The Game Awards actually helping its Future Class alumni?">Is The Game Awards actually helping its Future Class alumni?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Fares first pointed out the absence of news about the Future Class, some speculated that the silence had something to do with last year's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-class-members-call-game-awards-silence-a-collective-disappointment-">protest</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Future Class alumni and members about The Game Awards' decision to not make any statement about Israel's invasion of Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas. Future Class alumni had called on the Awards to plea for a ceasefire. Keighley and his cohosts did not acknowledge the conflict during the broadcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't seem to be the case. The lack of a 2024 Future Class may have to do with another lesser-known protest about the program that hasn't risen to the public eye: one pleading with the organization to do more for Future Class inductees and alumni.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a meeting with Geoff Keighley and Bouchac in December 2023, members reportedly gave a presentation on how they've felt underserved by an initiative meant to celebrate the "bright future" of the video game industry. The presentation discussed inadequate accommodations at the awards ceremony and a lack of opportunities for alumni after the spotlights faded away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources familiar with the online meeting (who requested anonymity to speak freely to protect their careers) said Keighley and Bouchac were receptive to feedback, and seemed interested in improving the program.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A copy of the presentation reviewed by Game Developer spelled out the specific complaints raised by inductees, and proposed a number of possible solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A large segment of the presentation addressed what seemed to be a negative experience for Future Class inductees and alumni attending the award ceremony in Los Angeles. Attendee ADA requests at last year's event allegedly weren't "honored," meaning some members with disabilities struggled to see the show. Alumni were apparently seated in segments of the Microsoft Theater where the view was blocked by camera rigs and equipment (those affected were reimbursed by The Game Awards for their tickets), and the only official networking event was a surprisingly informal "meetup" before the ceremony where Game Awards representatives only briefly attended, reportedly departing after photos were taken. The presentation alleges that Keighley did not make a personal appearance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members raised the fact that though the Future Class segment is sponsored by advertisers, there is no funding for them to travel to the event, leaving some honorees to watch at home. They also expressed disappointment over the lack of diversity among presenters onstage, such as the accessibility award not being revealed by a disabled presenter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Complaints were also raised about the lack of compensation for Future Class alumni who labor for the organization by mentoring new members, but weren't offered tickets to the awards themselves as part of their work. They're only offered a discount for purchasing their own tickets which according to ticketing site AXS, run anywhere from $50 to $500.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Presenters speaking to Keighley and Bouchac apparently expressed concern over the quality of support and resources offered to Future Class inductees after the the Game Awards spotlight fades. These resources include Unreal and Unity workshops, unpaid mentoring by previous Future Class nominees, and a slim amount of other opportunities. International inductees faced additional hurdles, as online events would sometimes be held in conflicting time zones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the presentation, Bouchac told Game Developer that the Future Class program regularly seeks feedback from inductees, and that while there is "always room to improve," a summer survey of participants showed the initiative and its benefits "improved" in 2024, with almost all saying the program was delivering on what it promised at the outset in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One-fifth of the 2023 class [ranked] the program as a 10/10 experience," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort">The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple Future Class inductees we spoke with praised the work the organization has done in the last year after the presentation. They explained the new resources and connections with industry veterans felt helpfulâ€”though there may still be some improvements to be made. "It did genuinely seem like they were trying to take the feedback into account," one 2023 cohort member explained, praising the survey described by Bouchac.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This individual's only complaint had to do with how The Game Awards has celebrated Future Class members this year on social media. A well-intentioned series of celebratory posts on X (formerly Twitter) were regularly mobbed by users spreading harassment. This followed the site's increasingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">lax approach to content moderation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">a growing right-wing backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to efforts at promoting diversity in games that exploded earlier in 2024. The Game Awards has since restricted replies on these posts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Future Class organizers apparently responded quickly to concerns raised by alumni over a lack of mentorship opportunities. Earlier in the year, they established a new networking program to support Future Class members and connect them with industry peers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some Future Class inductees have apparently greatly benefitted from this initiative, but others have reportedly had lackluster experiences, leaving them with just a few meetings with developers sometimes not skilled in mentoring junior developers. One source who participated in the mentorship process said they were frustrated by its limited structure, and that it wasn't as robust as those run by other professional organizations, like Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aiasfoundation.org/news/2024-2025_scholarships_open.asp">Scholarship program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also confirmed to Game Developer that The Game Awards is hosting a two-hour "connections mixer" before this year's ceremony with industry professionals and Future Class members from the 2023 cohort, but it's not branded as a Future Class-focused event. 2023 inductees have also been offered free tickets to this year's show and a compensated hotel room. These accommodations for members of last year's cohort appear to be a significant change from what was offered before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A 2023 class member told Game Developer they've appreciated the resources offered this year (praising "the free tickets, industry talks, and promotional opportunities") but offered a slightly cynical view of the program's mission. "I know this whole thing is just to launder The Game Awards' reputation so it doesn't look as disgustingly corporate as it is," they said. "But if they're taking advantage of me I at least like that I'm also taking advantage of them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the mentorship program and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">a Substack newsletter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maintained by Future Class alumni, there seems to have been little communication from The Game Awards about the future of Future Class. Bouchac's response to Game Developer implies the program is still active, but she didn't directly state if a new class of inductees would be introduced at this year's ceremony.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concerns expressed by Future Class alumni in 2023 and the ensuing slim communication raise uncomfortable questions about the program. Is The Game Awards offering enough support to the Future Class organizers in order to support the diverse group of rising developers inducted into the program?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it appears the answer will have to wait until 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

It had been in Early Access for a long timeâ€”from late 2017â€”and had been in some form of development going back to 2014.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I'll go over the broad history of the project and talk about some of the challengesâ€”including developing and abandoning our own engine and coming up with something that made the game feel truly unique, as well as the pitfalls we tried to navigate (which mainly came from our own naivety). With varying degrees of success, our tiny team chipped away at our game while trying to keep a community informed and happy over a long development cycle.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About Empires of the Undergrowth">About Empires of the Undergrowth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Slug Disco Studios was formed by three college friends in 2014 in order to make</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It took on its first new employee in early 2017, a community manager. It has since expanded to include a dedicated environment artist, two additional coders, and a larger marketing team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an RTS based in the world of ants, in which players excavate a subterranean nest to house their queen, raise her brood, and store food. This acts as the player's base. Overground, they collect resources, challenge enemy colonies, and deal with many threats from other creatures and the environment itself. It is set in a documentary style, with each real-life-inspired mission being narrated as if by voiceover for a TV documentary. Alongside this is a "mad scientist" sci-fi story where the player's persistent home colony of genetically modified ants battles against experiments thrown at it by an evil scientist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It began as a mobile game with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like underground mechanics and tug-of-war style overground gameplay. It's sometimes said (only semi-jokingly!) that the bitter disappointment of the now-defunct mobile version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the final kick up the arse needed to get the project started.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwz_rKC4uK0?si=5S1Z5-UQUgsaf6eL" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The trailer for the final species of ant added to the game with 1.0.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, it has evolved far beyond that initial premise. It has very much become its own thingâ€”with a pheromone-based control system with individual toggles for resource collection, fighting, and more. While the bones of its original inspiration are still clear to see, nothing else works quite like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turned out to be as it found its footing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on December 1, 2017, and went to full release on June 7, 2024.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine">Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally envisaged as a mobile game. Smartphones were relatively new when the idea was first being kicked about, before the current microtransaction and ad-heavy revenue model had fully established itself. In our adorable naivety, we were certain that people wouldn't mind paying outright for a well-made, quick-and-easy game that was free of such things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was intended to be a tug-of-war where the player dug out and built tiles underground while an AI opponent did the same on the opposite side of an east-to-west map. Units would fight for areas of territory in waves, with only minimal control needed from the player.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luDMqoiLyiM?si=bxo2D5CVDi3hZDG0" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A very early protype of the game, running on our proprietary engine.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we wanted lots of units and shadowing, it seemed logical to us to begin work on our own engine that would strip away a lot of what we considered the bloat of premade engines, and concentrate on the features needed for good performance on the mobile devices at the time. This continued for well over a year, while we struggled to find an audience for this undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It eventually became quite clear to us that the only chance we had of actually getting anyone apart from ourselves interested in the game was to move it to a more sensible platform: PC. Although it was a wrench to turn our backs on so much work for mobile, in the end, it was a blessing. It allowed the game to flourish far beyond its initial limited controls, and the bones of an actual RTS started to form. By posting on various forums and social media platforms, we noticed the first tangible public interest in the project.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding the game's DNA">Finding the game's DNA</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaving the mobile concept behind brought up the possibility of a much more fully-featured game, and one single change by one of our devs brought this into stark contrast. Originally, the player would simply create jobs, and ants would come and do them autonomously. By adding a "call-to-arms," a single point placed on the map with a right-click that would bring all of the player's ants to that spot, the basis of what eventually became the control system was made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't take much of a leap of imagination from there to envisage the call-to-arms point as the end of a pheromone trail, which is what ants use to lay down and reinforce foraging paths in the real world. Over time, we realized that having multiple "pheromone markers" on a map and assigning ants to them would give the feeling of controlling a swarm spreading out in multiple directionsâ€”but it was missing something.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Colorful pheromone markers denote the end of a foraging trail. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't seem right to give the player outright control of individual ants since it was starting to feel like we were on the edge of something really rather special while still paying homage to our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired roots. We've all seen ant trails, traveling in sensibly routed lines, back and forth as they carry forage back to their nests. We found that by having the ants travel back and forth, with the pheromone marker acting like the end of a trail and the queen its beginning, suddenly, this haphazard, awkward system sprung to life and started to feel like an ant colony. You weren't commanding units who would respond instantly over radio; you were making pheromone-based alterations to their behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, we eventually found the game's USP to be a set of systems that make the player feel as if they are making "suggestions" to the living, breathing superorganism that is an ant colony, eschewing the traditional drag-box-and-right-click that most RTS games employ. Taking it a step further, if the responsiveness of the trails is tuned just right, the player can get a sense that they're taking the role of the 'hive mind' of the colony; the emergent gestalt entity that is the sum of many tiny decisions made by hundreds of individuals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter attempt #1â€”Just trust us bro!">Kickstarter attempt #1â€”Just trust us bro!</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was still being made in our proprietary engine. In hindsight, this was because of the sunk cost fallacyâ€”we'd already thrown away a huge amount of research and optimization when we dropped the mobile idea, and clinging to the remains of the engine was definitely out of sentiment rather than logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In late 2015, we decided to attempt a Kickstarter campaign to get the word out, using footage recorded in this engine. While it was functional for most of what we wanted to do, it was not easy to work with and did not look particularly great.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOHhKKz1cNM?si=qZnl0yOlh0ug82UT" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A trailer to go along with the first Kickstarter attempt</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Kickstarter was not successful, reaching only Â£8,438 of its Â£15,000 goal. People liked the Attenborough-style voiceover and the clear documentary slant we were aiming for, but this wasn't enough to get most people to bite. While the simplistic graphics were likely part of the reason for this, there were two far larger ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first is overambition. Our first Kickstarter was replete with stretch goals, unrealistic expectations, and clearly getting far ahead of ourselves. These were not made out of deliberate exaggeration, but with that overambitious optimism that comes with being entirely new to something much more complex than you can really appreciate. Serious backers can spot this a mile off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second one was that we had no working prototype or demo. It's difficult to ask members of the public to trust in first-time game developers who can't at least show that their idea is sound in principle, has a fun game loop, and has the potential to end up being worth the early investment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unreal Engineâ€”demonstrably better">Unreal Engineâ€”demonstrably better</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we had gained some momentum online and the word had gotten out more (even with the failed Kickstarter), we knew that we should strike while the iron was hot and try again in as short an order as possible. If we were to do better the second time around, we would have to address both of the major points mentioned above.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we needed to get a working demo out reasonably quickly at this point. Reeling things in a bit, with heavy heart, we said goodbye to our in-house engine. We looked at several options, and in the end, there were only two choices that made sense to us: Unity and Unreal Engine 4. After extensive testing, Unreal Engine 4 was chosen due to its flexibility, great out-of-the-box graphics, and C++ implementation (the team was very familiar with C++, and the original engine was written in it).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>An early shot of the game in Unreal Engine 4, a huge upgrade from our own engine. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn't long before a demo was written, and even using the original assets from the custom engine, it looked much better right off the bat. A music track was written for the demo, which helped to add atmosphere and establish the tone of this subterranean world. Swallowing the instinctive pride that led us to try to make our own engine completely from scratch was a learning experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The earliest versions of this demo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http:// https://www.indiedb.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth/downloads">are still available for download on IndieDB</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo">Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a demo now collecting feedback and even getting some dedicated videos by content creators on YouTube, the time was right for a second Kickstarter. We reeled in our goal to Â£10,000 and set much more modest stretch goalsâ€”things that were definitely achievable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of offering lofty but unrealistic things such as whole separate campaigns, multiplayer modes, and fully-featured level editors, we instead had them offering single creatures to the game from a limited selection, which was also useful for us in whittling down the choices between the many millions of insect species we could have chosen from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of being more realistic about the ambition of the project and having a working demo that clearly showed the game loop, as well as a feel for its setting, meant that this time, the campaign not only succeeded but achieved 180% of its asking goal.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So you've got a community. What now?">So you've got a community. What now?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suddenly, we found ourselves with a lot of people eager for our game and quickly tried to organize that with a discussion forum. That worked to some extent, but with such a small team of three, it became clear that the owners would need to spend almost all of their time on the project doing development work, leaving little room for community management and other marketing tasks. While everyone was involved with everything (and still is to some extent), a dedicated community manager was the logical first hire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to bring on a community person towards the start of 2017 was the correct one, as the number one important thing with an Early Access title is to keep people well informed of what is going on. Updates to the demo helped a lot with that, but things like newsletters could become much more detailed, and having someone to quickly respond to technical support questions and create and reply to social media posts gave the community the confidence that their investment was not going to waste.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Access begins">Early Access begins</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of December 2017, roughly 18 months after the successful Kickstarter campaign, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on Steam. Other platforms followed later. At this point, the game's story mode had been divided into five "tiers", each representing a completed and polished package of content. Early Access launched with the first two of these five ready to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, large updates would be few and far between; the remaining major updates came out in April 2019, June 2022 and June 2024 respectively. There were many smaller but still significant updates inbetween, such as a freeplay or custom game mode, a battle arena for testing army compositions, and several extra levels that were apart from the campaign story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Quality over quantity">Quality over quantity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the very early feedback we got from paying members of the public was that the game was in good shape for an initial Early Access release, and this influenced our philosophy going forward. An older school of thought with Early Access was to release little and often, but we weren't so sure. With our small team size, making completed packages took at least a day for one of our devs (and often quite a bit more if there were errors to work through), which was costly. Making packages for all system demographics (Win x64, Win x86, Mac, Linux) was only really justifiable for larger updates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it was clear that some players were happy to report bugs (pun always intended) and provide detailed feedback, the majority of early adopters were expecting a polished product that grows over time. This meant that major releases would come slowly, but would also mean they would generally be better received than smaller iterative ones. Giant leaps, rather than small steps.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Optional betas: Players as testers">Optional betas: Players as testers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully, there are, of course, tools that allow experimental features and balances to be tested by people who were keen to do so, and optional beta tests became a valuable tool. We were lucky enough to get very detailed and well-thought-out feedback from a lot of people, and some of these became an integral part of our community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly before the second of our major tier releases in 2022 (the "Fire Ant Update") we gathered some of the best together into a focus group, which to this day provides initial feedback for releases, usually before they go out to anyone else. Hold on to your best community members and look after them.</span></p><p>Image via Slug Disco.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A long stretchâ€”Keeping people happy">A long stretchâ€”Keeping people happy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spent just over six and a half years in Early Access. This is far longer than we intended and, indeed, far longer than anyone expected. The early hiring of a community manager was crucial in ensuring this could happen. Their focus was often on reassuring people that things were happening (a common complaint for titles that update rarely or infrequently)â€”it is not fair to expect people to do more than a cursory search when asking if a game is dead. Several approaches were taken to conclude that search with a positive result:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty: first and foremost, people appreciate developers who understand their own limitations. For example, when asked why we didn't have release dates or ETAs for certain updates, the truthful answer of "We suck at guessing when we'll be done" was often the best approach</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Frequent engagement: although it is often advisable not to be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>too</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> active on discussion boards (and certainly not to get into arguments), showing a presence in answering queries and helping with technical issues is very beneficial. For those who want to talk more in-depth, Discord is ideal</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Formal news: progress newsletters were infrequently made before a dedicated community person was hired, but with them, concentrating on it, these could be regular and far more detailed. Later in the development cycle, a similarly regular vlog was also made as a visual counterpart to newsletters for those who dislike a lot of reading</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roadmaps: even when they change a lot, having an up-to-date roadmap goes a long way to reassuring a potential buyer of the immediate future. We updated ours every six months and continue to do so</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Positive response to feedback: the temptation is often to get defensive, but having someone who can be somewhat impartial to feedback, even harsh or seemingly unfair, and process it in a more digestible way for devs is valuable</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Extras: we developed semi-regular extra levels during particularly long stretches of the dev cycle. These almost always used existing assets and were more stripped down, taking only a few hours to develop as opposed to months for a full campaign mission</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Surprises: although we were usually open in the broad strokes of what was coming next, we occasionally dropped complete surprises on the community, which were always well received. For example, the arrival of the 'Adventure' extra level without an announced date and the fact that players could play as termites in the final tier</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final release">Final release</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game left Early Access and went to v1.0 in June 2024, with the final tier of the campaign story (the "Matabele Ant Update"). We had acquired a publishing partner, Hooded Horse, a little over a year before full releaseâ€”we'd been self-published up until that point. They certainly helped us feel that the release was going to be suitably grand after such a long time.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELSOKmgDRvA?si=O05D3kj4BXH444ar" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The launch trailer, made by our friends at Hooded Horse.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of the time of writing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has sold in excess of 450,000 copies during its lifetime.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's hard to say what I would have done differently as what happened ultimately lead to the creation of a game I am extremely proud of", says developer John. "It is extremely hard to finish a game, sticking to it for that much of your life and stopping yourself from being pulled onto other exciting projects you keep thinking of. You lose the ability to tell if your game is even fun anymore."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"However I am not proud of its back-end structure and organization, we would never really have had an idea of what works in project organization and coding standards without making the mistakes in the first place. I would probably have spent more time making smaller projects and getting used to dealing with the code base, then restarted with the lessons learned for our full ant-based vision. That said, that is basically what we will be doing nowâ€”we just took the long way around to get there!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big, massive elephant in the room here, from a technical point of view, is multiplayer. "Without a doubt, I would plan for multiplayer early on," says Matt, the engine specialist on the team, when also asked about what he'd do if starting again. "I always envisaged multiplayer as being a part of it, and despite all the advice that was even about back then, we still kicked the can down the road expecting to get it running at some point."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a complete redo of the project, the groundwork for multiplayer would have been established very early on and the rest of the game would be built around that. In the end, the promised story mode had to take precedence and now it is highly unlikely that we can justify multiplayer for this projectâ€”but thankfully, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will not be our only project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you for reading the not-so-short history of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
