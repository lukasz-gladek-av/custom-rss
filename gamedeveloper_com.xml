According to Schreier, Bloomberg News learned about the departure yesterday, which comes as Amazon reportedly retreats from the PC and console video game space in favor of its cloud gaming service, Luna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news was shared after Amazon announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026">its latest round of job cuts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a message to employees, later posted on the Amazon website, which will impact around 16,000 roles across the company. Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, didn't clarify which sectors and divisions are impacted. Game Developer reached out to Amazon Game Studios for clarification.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, the official line is that Amazon will continue "hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions" that are "critical" to the company's future. "We're still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there's significant opportunity ahead," Galetti wrote one paragraph after announcing the 16,000 job cuts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-retains-optimism-in-vr-after-reality-labs-loses-83-6-billion-in-six-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Meta retains 'optimism' in VR after Reality Labs loses $83.6 billion in six years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, the SVP said that announcing broad reductions every few months isn't the plan. Yet, every team will "continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers," and make adjustments "as appropriate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This new wave of layoffs is taking place mere three months after Amazon made approximately 14,000 people redundant within its corporate workforce, a decision which included staff within its video game division. At the time, Galetti said the aim is to operate like the "world's largest startup" and eliminating bureaucracy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs," she wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after the announcement, Amazon Games announced the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-is-ending-active-development-on-new-world">end of active development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New World: Aeternum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the company, they reached a point where it was "no longer sustainable" to continue supporting the game with new content updates. At the time, the company reportedly shared insights about its goals and aspirations regarding its gaming business internally, as per a memo to staff </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">obtained by Variety</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the report, the company said the staff cuts indicated a larger strategy shift within the games division.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Largely, this reportedly translated to halting a "significant amount" of first-party AAA game development work, which led to "significant role reductions" in Amazon's studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing team. The company's plan, then, seems to be to continue to work with external studio partners. This includes Crystal Dynamics, which recently unveiled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which are expect to launch in 2026 and 2027, respectively. The developer made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-owned-crystal-dynamics-confirms-another-round-of-layoffs">three rounds of job cuts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-hardware-revenue-tumbled-by-32-percent-in-q2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Xbox hardware revenue tumbled by 32 percent in Q2</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

It also outlines 14 reasons to empower women in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the reasons argues that "AI, virtual worlds, and the metaverse will define tomorrow," and as such, "women must help shape that future, not simply play within it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the vision behind this point, as well as what role will women play in influencing or shaping it, Isaaman said that her vision is one where these technologies are built to reflect the full diversity of the people who use them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That simply cannot happen if women are absent from the rooms where creative, technical, and ethical decisions are made," she continued in an email response. "Women must be involved not only as participants or consumers, but as designers, engineers, artists, leaders, and decision-makers who actively shape how these worlds function and who they serve."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-82-percent-of-us-based-game-developers-support-unionization" target="_self" data-discover="true">82 percent of US-based game developers support unionization</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, the CEO says that if women are excluded from the creation of AI systems, virtual economies, and immersive worlds, existing biases around representation, safety, access, and opportunity will be "hard-coded" into the future. In other words, "Inclusion is a safeguard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about Isaaman's stance on AI, a technology that has seen </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai">pushback</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from some </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">corners</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the industry throughout 2025, she said that the use of AI in the games industry, as in every creative and technical sector, is "not going away."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The question is not whether AI exists, but how it is used, who controls it, and who benefits from it. I fully understand why there is pushback, particularly at a time when the industry has seen devastating job losses. Ethical AI means recognizing that technology should augment human creativity, not replace it, devalue it, or exploit it. It means transparency about how AI tools are trained, how data is sourced, and how decisions are made. It means respecting intellectual property, creative labor, and the people whose work underpins these systems."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking on behalf of Women in Games as a whole, Isaaman said the organization believes AI must be developed and deployed responsibly, with "clear ethical frameworks and accountability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting creativity, accessibility, and innovation, but only if it is shaped by diverse voices and guided by human values. Protecting jobs, protecting creativity, and protecting people are not anti-technology positions. They are pro-future ones."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-amazon-game-studios-boss-is-leaving-the-company" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Amazon Game Studios boss is leaving the company</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The manifesto, originally published in 2024, has been updated for 2026 to reflect the current state of the industry. As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.womeningames.org/the-manifesto/">the site reads</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Women in Games says that while awareness and engagement have grown, the scales remain unbalanced, with women still under-represented across the games workforce—particularly in leadership and decision-making roles—despite making up nearly half of all players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To create a fair playing field, the scales must be rebalanced—through equity, visibility, accountability, and partnership," reads the manifesto.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Women in Games says the document is a declaration of intent, while also introducing a new initiative called Women in Games Voices: The Living Guide. The guide consists of videos, podcasts, essays, and teaching tools, spanning across a decade of talks and panels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Women in Games seeks to continue addressing key spheres of action by partnering with studios and companies to improve gender representation, mentoring, supporting networks of ambassadors and chapters, and promoting representation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Progress does not happen by accident—it happens when people come together with clarity, courage, and purpose," Isaaman said via a press release.
