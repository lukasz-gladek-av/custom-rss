On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences," explained Guillemot.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/belfast-xr-festival-launches-200-000-fund-to-support-emerging-xr-developers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Belfast XR Festival launches 200,000 GBP fund to support emerging XR developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best-in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reduction initiatives to rightsize the organization. We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/exclusive-marketing-agency-1sp-acquires-networking-platform-meettomatch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Exclusive: 1SP Agency acquires game event networking platform MeetToMatch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Guillemot claims the sweeping changes will mark a "decisive turning point" for Ubisoft, leaving it well placed to deliver "sustainable growth" in the years ahead.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A new structure to 'sharpen strategic focus' and 'reinforce execution discipline'">A new structure to 'sharpen strategic focus' and 'reinforce execution discipline'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the graphic below shows, one of the five creative houses Ubisoft has chosen to stake its future on is Vantage Studios, the nascent subsidiary formed with financial backing from Tencent.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vantage will be focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft's largest franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Four more as-yet-unnamed creative houses will be established to oversee the development of other key franchises, which be sorted based on distinct genres and player experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Ubisoft said each creative house will be "responsible for fully owning the gamer relationship" and will benefit from dedicated leadership.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Each Creative House will have end-to-end responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy).

The new business layer will be composed of both 'Creative Network' and 'Core Services.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ubisoft, Creative Network will unite a "powerful set of studios providing best-in-class production capacity and cross-functional creative expertise serving the Creative Houses." Notably, it will operate within a structured, project-by-project collaboration framework that allows it to deliver both co-development or end-to-end mandates under the direction of each creative house.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Core Services, meanwhile, has been branded the "backbone" of Ubisoft's new ecosystem and is described as an "enabler" for its creative houses. It will be responsible for providing scalable technology, production capabilities such as localization and QA, and business operations and services.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To support the implementation of its new model, Ubisoft said it is imperative that employees across all teams return to in-office working five days per week—though it intends to offer an (unspecified) annual allowance of remote working days.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft confirms more cost-cutting and possible 'asset divestitures'">Ubisoft confirms more cost-cutting and possible 'asset divestitures'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft claims all of the above is in service of introducing a refocused portfolio based on a "meaningfully revised roadmap."

The answer is 'a lot.'&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher confirmed it has now discontinued six titles that failed to meet its "enhanced" bar for quality.

This includes rightsizing the organization and focusing resources on core value-creating activities, notably through further restructuring and strict hiring discipline across all functions. The Group also continues to consider potential asset divestitures," states the announcement.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As part of this effort to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market conditions, the Group has already taken decisive actions to adjust its studio footprint.
