"Excluding the impact of the return of customer incentives issued by ironSource prior to the merger ('customer credits') for which we received approximately $21 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, Grow Solutions revenue would have been up 2 percent year-over-year," said Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q4 revenue from Unity's strategic portfolio (which encompasses the engine, cloud and monetization) was $442 million, up 4 percent year-over-year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg said those quarterly results should provide optimism as the company's works to reshape its business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Company's fourth quarter results meaningfully exceeded expectations on both revenue and profit, underscoring our progress in building a new Unity," said Bromberg.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The successful launch of Unity 6, the appeal of our new pricing model, and the progress we’re making in AI for our advertising customers are providing a lot of optimism for the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking briefly at Unity's annual performance, full-year revenue fell by 17 percent to $1.81 billion. Again, the company said that drop was "driven by our portfolio reset, the Weta FX termination, and decreases in Grow Solutions revenue."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create Solutions revenue declined by 29 percent year-on-year to $614 million.
