Between September 2023 to September 2024, the Israeli studio generated $613 million in revenue, up 1.2 percent from the 2022-2023 fiscal year. In that same 12-month period, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Raid </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">grew by 2.3 percent from the preious year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plarium was first picked up by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-vikings-war-of-clans-i-developer-plarium-snapped-up-for-500m">Australian casino company Aristocrat</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2017, a year prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Raid's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/steam-new-apis-devs-easier-build-access-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve recently pushed a new set of Steam APIs to address "common challenges" for a game's different versions on the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, developers can provide players access to an older build version of their game, and a way to preserve their saves from those previous iterations. In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve admitted the original process was "fairly obscure," but now lets developers "offer players this choice from within the game itself."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes, it continued, "give players more clear choices in how they want to engage with the game. Some want to be part of your beta branch where you are testing out the latest updates, while others may want to play on an older stable build that they know works well with their save file."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Previously, players would have to access those beta branches on their own in the 'Settings' tab; now, developers can add a button and text to a game's menu that shows what a build a player has and invite them to join the beta branch. Inside that branch, players will "see new UI immediately next to the play button in Steam that shows the current beta they have set, and easily lets them opt back out if they so choose."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once selected, Steam will reboot and relaunch the game into beta mode and its player-selected build. That build will be further reflected in the game's Steam library page.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for game saves, Valve said the new APIs make it so players are asked if they would like to still use the older version of a title rather than defaulting to the newer one. It noted that "trouble can arise when players with dozens or hundreds of hours of playtime find that their save file no longer works with the latest version of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By "adding some logic" to their game, devs can check what version a player's existing save is linked to, something Valve said is primarily an issue for Early Access games. Alternatively, they could specify version numbers in save files or map a version of their game to a branch ID that "creates a table somewhere in your game that is aware of which versions correspond with each Steam Beta Branch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The onus will fall on devs to plug these four APIs into their games themselves, and more information on them can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

Last week, at least two (now-former) staffers revealed they were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/DeanDobbs/status/1853925561334219246">let go</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources speaking to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/more-layoffs-at-payload-studios">GamesIndustry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have claimed eight workers were impacted in this newest round of reductions. These workers were reportedly informed a month in advance, and will not receive redundancy pay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Payload CEO and co-founder Russell Clarke confirmed to the outlet that layoffs </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>did </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">happen, but stopped at revealing specific numbers. In his statement, he said the cuts came "out of the blue after a project that we were relying on did not materialize." In August, Clarke cited the wider industry tumult as reason for those reductions, and came despite the studio's best efforts to avoid it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Layoffs have been a constant throughout the industry in the past two years. Every month has seen </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/stjv-alleges-don-t-nod-management-brutally-advancing-toward-layoffs-encourages-staff-walkout">heavy losses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to studios' workforce, often by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-shuts-down-concord-dev-firewalk-and-mobile-studio-neon-koi">the dozens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and occasionally the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-overreached-with-big-bets-and-now-530-people-are-losing-their-jobs">hundreds</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, depending on the developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Clarke, the number of impacted Payload devs and other specifics, like "the handling of the notice period and redundancy payments," are still being determined. "But we had to notify staff last week, to give as much warning as possible to all those who might be affected. [...] We are a small studio fighting to survive in very challenging times, but as always, our people are our highest priority."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Clarke also corroborated a claim that one of the impacted developers was a Payload co-founder, though he was vague on which one. However, he more conclusively stated the Payload that comes out of these layoffs "will need to be very lean" going forward.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
