After a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5">fast and furious Nintendo Direct </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">on April 2, the Kyoto publisher ushered an assembly of press and influencers into an event space in midtown Manhattan, all eager for a chance to learn the ins and outs of the mysterious new console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's fierce secrecy about the new console has left not just players, but developers wondering what new major advancement the company wants to put front-and-center. The Nintendo Switch was a massive hit for Nintendo not just because of the detachable Joy-Con controllers, but also because of the portability. The Switch 2, it turns out, trades hardware innovation for online social multiplayer features built right into the console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But some tech advancements—and the "mouse" gameplay mode supported by the new JoyCons—open some doors for creative developers to break ground on games for the console. Of the games we saw at the New York event, it was titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sid Meier's Civilization VII, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that showed the greatest potential for developer inspiration.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Joy-Con &quot;mouse&quot; mode can bring more PC games to console">The Joy-Con "mouse" mode can bring more PC games to console</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto explained in an "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-1/">Ask a Dev</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" blog post posted by Nintendo yesterday that Joy-Con mouse control mode came about after he was playing games on PC and mused that the Joy-Con itself might work well as a control device rarely used on consoles. "Switch 2 was originally designed to support a wider range of games by improving the system's processing speed, so with that in mind, I thought it'd be better to be able to play interesting games that require a mouse," he said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dredge-wasn-t-originally-going-to-be-a-narrative-game-but-then-it-became-one-of-2023-s-best" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dredge wasn't originally going to be a narrative game, but then it became one of 2023's best</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also credited a theory from former Nintendo R&amp;D general manager Gunpei Yokoi called "lateral thinking of withered technology," which states that that new products can be created by using widely-used technology no longer seen as "cutting edge" for new and unusual functions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a group Q&amp;A held at Nintendo's New York preview event, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.latercera.com/">La Tercera</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> writer Axel Frederick asked Kawamoto about the fact that most places players use the Nintendo Switch like the couch, a comfy chair, or the bed, aren't ideal environments for mouse control. "We have made adjustments so that you can control the mouse on your pants," Kawamoto responded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There weren't any chances to drag the Switch 2 Joy-Con across my trousers (probably for the better...), but there was time to experiment with the click-based controls. Maybe it was my lowered expectations, but it was surprising that flipping a Joy-Con on its side and using the R/L buttons as a "left click" and the ZR/ZL buttons as a "right click" felt satisfying. I endeavored to keep my expectations in check—this feature isn't earth-shattering. It is at the end of the day, a humble computer mouse.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-star-wars-outlaws-poker-style-mini-game-helped-to-define-its-tone" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Star Wars Outlaws' poker-style mini-game helped to define its tone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showed surprising ways that "humble" can form an intoxicating brew. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prime 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s base controls are similar to those seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime Remastered</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, updating the original GameCube twin-stick scheme for one that supports motion controls centered on the "lock on" feature initiated by pushing the left trigger button. In a quick back-and-forth test, using the mouse to aim Samus' Power Cannon felt smoother than switching to traditional Joy-Con motion aiming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the "back-and-forth" where some of the magic happens. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players can switch control schemes just by turning the Joy-Con from one position to another. In literal seconds, they can swap from mouse, to twin-stick with motion controls, to mouse again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta explained to Game Developer that developers who don't want players to accidentally switch control modes can turn off this feature and make it a more menu-driven choice. He danced away from explaining precisely how it worked, but alluded to the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors being other "unique" features developers can take advantage of.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedy-first-approach-to-thank-goodness-you-re-here" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We write good stuff in the pub:' the comedy first approach to Thank Goodness You're Here</a></p><p>Image via Nintendo.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the Joy-Cons are capable of such subtle switches (possibly with the help of the gyroscope and accelerometer, if we're trying to pick apart Dohta's answer), it might open the door to designers who can think of reasons to make players switch between conventional Joy-Con usage and "mouse mode" on a regular basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kawamoto said he was delighted to hear that we were "surprised" by the feature during play, so if nothing else, Nintendo thinks that surprising players with the capabilities of the Joy-Con is fertile territory for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next let's talk about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. At first this is an obvious no-brainer. Turn-based strategy games on PC (and already on consoles) can now have proper mouse controls on the Nintendo Switch 2. In 2006 this would have been revolutionary, in 2025 it'd be fine to ask "is that it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Checking out the game and chatting with Firaxis Games executive producer Dennis Shirk, I was struck by two surprising facts: first, the aforementioned positive clicking sensation really sings in a turn-based environment. Many players will find the physical sensation of clicking a Nintendo Switch 2 mouse to be more favorable than your average PC mouse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second, as Shirk pointed out in our conversation, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the Switch 2 mouse has more buttons than your average PC mouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Shirk explained that at Firaxis and among hardcore Civilization players, it's generally understood that the the most devoted players use custom mice with mappable macro commands on the side for more efficient empire-building.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 mice aren't as modular or precisely designed as an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rog.asus.com/us/mice-mouse-pads/mice/wireless/rog-spatha-x-model/">Asus ROG Spatha X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Firaxis is staring down a funnel of new </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> console players who will learn how to play the game on a more complex device. "We're actually pleasantly surprised how absolutely versatile it was," he said. "The flexibility that offers our traditional PC players to play on the go is an instant win."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a neat opportunity for developers porting mouse-friendly games to console to see what new tools they can offer players that they couldn't before. I can imagine that a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://theroottreesaredead.com/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> now has a far more natural home on console than it would have before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shirk said Firaxis developers working on the Switch 2 port were surprised by how many kinds of surfaces the mouse controls worked on (including the aforementioned pants). In Dohta's response to Frederick during the group Q&amp;A, he said that playing multiplayer wheelchair basketball game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Drag X Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by rubbing the controllers on their laps was the "preferred" way of playing the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Drag X Drive—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">I can't recommend it as a good case study for using both Joy-cons in mouse mode. Dohta explained that the demo stations set up for the preview weren't an ideal play scenario because both mice were situated on a table in front of the player. The game is meant to mimic operating a wheelchair, and moving the mice forward and backward on your lap is a more natural motion than on a full table.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I tried the demo tables for myself, it was awkward and unpleasant, leaving the game feeling like a hollow successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_(video_game)">Arms</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a multiplayer tech demo that didn't necessarily birth a genre or franchise. It made me wish Nintendo had opted for a single-player puzzle game of some sort with this mechanic, because a multiplayer game that isn't exceptionally unique will fade fast, and players will be less likely to experiment with "dual-mouse" layout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other journalists I spoke with agreed with Dohta that the table setup may have made for a less favorable impression. But even with proper seating, I'm worried dual mice design is a dead-end. It should be a major opportunity for some new kind of gameplay, but the history of the Nintendo Switch shows that for third-party developers, games on Switch need to be portable to other platforms. And you can't port a "dual mice" game anywhere, not even a PC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the Switch 2's only major addition was the mouse functionality, I'd be more worried about the console's prospects. But with the overwhelming online multiplayer tools the device is built around, I'm less worried about the console's creative prospects hanging on this one thread.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="DLSS and improved processing power open the door for gorgeous (if not radically different) games">DLSS and improved processing power open the door for gorgeous (if not radically different) games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's common to hear from developers that, as the Nintendo Switch reaches the end of its lifespan, it's become harder to port games with increasing graphical fidelity, often trading heavily on performance and load times just to achieve functionality. Those teams are likely to feel unleashed with the Nintendo Switch 2, as developers like CD Projekt Red and FromSoftware are leading the way in porting games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the device. Neither port is likely to be as technically impressive as their PC and PS5/Xbox brethren, but the Switch 2's mobility and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/">specs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which outpace Valve's Steam Deck in many respects) are impressive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Supergiant Games creative director Greg Kasavin was on hand with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, grinning from ear to ear as he watched players try his game out on the next-generation Switch. "We knew we'd be making this game for the Switch 2 before we even knew there was a Switch 2," he said, explaining that the Switch 2 doesn't offer any significant upgrades over other console versions, but it does deliver a better visual experience than the Switch version. "A lot of it is just kind of the raw satisfaction of a higher definition display," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the first-party side Nintendo is touting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an example of the "new kinds of gameplay" enabled by the Switch 2 hardware. "In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you can experience the exhilaration of being able to destroy anything you want in the game without restrictions," said Kawamoto in Nintndo's "Ask a Dev" series, also pointing to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s "open world" linking all the racetracks together as benefits of the console's improved processing power.</span></p><p>Image via Nintendo.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart World's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> open world lobby is fine, but it's more interesting for its social play implications than its technical novelty. It's the Knockout Tour mode that brings the technology to life. Knockout Tour is a battle royale-like experience as the massive 24-player lobbies can vote on a number of race circuits that they play through uninterrupted. Players start the race in one course, then are steadily eliminated, with the top racers making it all the way through five maps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is that kind of gameplay possible on another platform? Maybe, but credit to Nintendo, many other kart racers have hit the market since the last </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game and none of them attempted this kind of feature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is something of a head scratcher. It's a charming return for Nintendo's simian sidekick (yes I'm calling him a sidekick now they haven't made new </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games in years), giving him a chance to fill a roll filled by Mario in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the Nintendo Switch: the role of the family-friendly action game hero available with the console on day one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers curious about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should maybe look at it as a study in layered level design. Players are able to destroy most of the terrain in the large maps, and Nintendo has populated the world with cave systems and hidden treasures that reward players pounding at rocks like a toddler in a playground. It's impressive that the game contains well-constructed linear areas that players can navigate from all ends as well as deeply-dug secrets. A Nintendo demo rep and I chatted back and forth about how it compared to the sensation of snooping out secrets in other open-world games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But beyond the "Donkey Kong" charm of it all (and it is very charming, the voice going "ooooh ba-na-NA whenever you picked up a banana was an instant win), the chunky digging spaces didn't feel that remarkable considering the amazing destructible voxel worlds of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teardown</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or the jaw-dropping verticality of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I suppose it's significant that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pulls off a similar type of gameplay with higher-fidelity graphics, but it doesn't feel like the kind of game to inspire a generation of fast-followers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what does feel exciting? The Switch 2 supports NVIDIA's DLSS thanks to a custom-made processor from the video card manufacturer. Inverse's Shannon Liao quizzed the Switch 2's hardware leadership about its use of the frame generation technology and what possibilities it offered for first-and-third party developers. "We do use DLSS upscaling technology, and that's something we'll continue to use as we develop games," said Dohta, adding that its inclusion can help developers design games that output to resolutions as humble as 1920x1080 and as potent as 4K with HDR.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That caught my attention. I finally caught the bug for frame generation after a recent stint with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the Steam Deck. Frame generation can help developers push the boundaries of what framerates their games can pull off, and while it may not look as authentic on a large display it's a force multiplier for games played in portable mode. Not every game needs to run higher than 60fps, but many franchises under Microsoft's umbrella, from Halo, to Call of Duty, to Forza Horizon, and beyond, are best enjoyed with the smoothest possible frame rates. Will DLSS help Microsoft </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-signs-binding-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms">make good on its promise</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the FTC that it would bring Call of Duty to Nintendo?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Possibly. For now, if you're hoping to debut a smooth-as-butter game on the Nintendo Switch 2, NVIDIA's AI-driven frame generation tech may help you hit those desired performance levels.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Should developers prioritize the Switch 2?">Should developers prioritize the Switch 2?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In my heart of hearts, I hope the Joy-Con mouse function ushers in a quiet revolution of exceptional strategy games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It occurs to me now that Microsoft has reason to port </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Age of Empires II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to a platform, continuing the life of a game I spent hours on at the ripe old age of 9. If your game is more fun with a mouse than a controller, this feature is an opportunity to build a new audience beyond the world of PC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, it'll be up to FromSoftware to show the game development community what the Switch 2 has to offer that other consoles can't. It was the only studio to show up with a bona fide Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive: a gothic PvPvE game called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Duskbloods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Frustratingly, the company didn't reveal more than a highlight reel of in-engine footage that showed off some stunning art direction and tantalizing gameplay, but failed to detail which of the Switch 2's new features it would lean heavily on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coming into the preview, I confess I was worried that Nintendo couldn't free itself from the Nintendo Switch's groundbreaking asset: the portability. Since its launch, the unique features of the Joy-Con controllers have faded in relevance, with motion controls and gyroscopes not driving widely-used game mechanics. The bestselling Switch games of the last year include titles ranging from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. (With free-to-play mainstays like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">regularly on the most-downloaded list).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on the day, the kinds of the games on the eShop top charts might not look that different than the kind seen on the Steam Top Selling list. If any other portable hardware maker surpassed Nintendo in its ease of use, it could eat away at what made the Switch so special.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, GameChat is convincing me that Nintendo has a strategy beyond "The Nintendo Switch, but better." It takes pressure off the humble mouse feature, which no longer has to lift a console's worth of unique game genres.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of all the Switch 2's many improvements, it's the one that makes me daydream of what kinds of new and unique games the console could support.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
