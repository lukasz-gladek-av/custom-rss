It also plans to pursue "select mobile M&amp;A opportunities" and expand its hyper-casual footprint. That tidbit comes alongside the announcement that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-has-sold-private-division-to-an-undisclosed-buyer">Take-Two has sold its Private Division publishing label</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

That figure was at the top of the company's guidance range and was driven by the strength of key franchises like Borderlands and Grand Theft Auto.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recurrent consumer spending (RCS) rose by 6 percent year-over-year and represented 80 percent of total net bookings. Take-Two said that upswing was "slightly above" its guidance of 5 percent, and was partly driven by mobile titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Toon Blast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Match Factory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. RCS within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> remained relatively flat, while NBA 2K delivered single digit growth.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Grand Theft Auto V continues to shine after more than a decade on shelves">Grand Theft Auto V continues to shine after more than a decade on shelves</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> outperformed expectations, with the title now having sold more than 205 million units worldwide. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a "fantastic" quarter and has now sold over 67 million units to-date. Take-Two also praised </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NBA 2K25</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for delivering "phenomenal recurrent consumer spending performance" and said the basketball sim has sold almost 4.5 million units.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NBA 2K24 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for the same period last year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NBA 2K25</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> delivered meaningful double-digit growth in average revenue per user and 40 percent growth in average games per user," reads the report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Numerous other catalog titles also outperformed expectations. The Borderlands franchise was name-checked as a standout performer, and Take-Two said it's eager to capitalize on the "many potential growth opportunities" for the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, Take-Two said its quarterly results exceeded its guidance range largely due to a "shift in timing of marketing expense within the year." With that in mind, company president </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">Karl Slatoff reiterated the company's net bookings</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> outlook range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which would represent 5 percent growth over fiscal 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Slatoff said he expects fiscal 2026 to be a "milestone year" thanks to the launch of "several blockbuster titles" including G</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in late 2025, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Borderlands 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
