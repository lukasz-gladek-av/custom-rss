Hosts Casey Newton and Kevin Roose pressed Baszucki on the topic of child safety on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">This concern is fresh in the public eye after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-discord-sued-for-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor">parents&nbsp;</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-corp-responds-to-louisiana-lawsuit-that-claims-it-built-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles-">state attorneys general</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sued the company for failing to stop young users from being targeted by predators.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Baszucki went on the podcast to discuss </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-will-soon-enforce-age-checks-to-limit-conversations-between-minors-and-adults">new age-gating technologies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being incorporated in its moderation strategy—and proceeded to spar with Newton and Roose while defending the platform's track record on safety.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It got tense," reads a headline documenting a transcript of the exchange. "Tense" may be underselling it. Baszucki grew more combative after Roose asked about an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">October 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> report from now-shuttered activist fund Hindenburg research accusing the company of being "a pedophile hellscape for kids."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Fun. Let’s keep going down this," Baszucki replied. "And so, first off, Hindenburg is no longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason. The other thing is, have you researched that information?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Baszucki further pressed the host about his own "research" into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s trust and safety efforts before falling back to explain that AI models are becoming more effective at content moderation—then grew sarcastic after asking Roose if he would "pick" those improved models.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft's first playable generative AI experience is an R&amp;D experiment called 'Teammates'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Good, so you’re aligning with what we did.

Newton explained they had been told Baszucki wanted to come on the podcast to discuss the new technology, but Baszucki seemed to have a different understanding of the situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I want to highlight, I came here because I love your podcast and came to talk about everything. So if our PR people said, 'Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,' I’m up for it, but I love your pod. I thought I came here to talk about everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After Newton observed he was "a little bit frustrated," Baszucki denied the claim and resurfaced the topic of his purpose for coming on the show. "I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that. So I’m not frustrated, I’m just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus. But I’m happy to talk about whatever you guys want."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Savvy Games Group's Saudi-owned parent fund is running low on investable cash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He seemed more engaged when turning to the topic of betting markets like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://polymarket.com/">Polymarket</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and how they might be better at predicting results than journalists.
