The creative director will no longer be involved in development at Warhorse Studios, culminating a 14-year tenure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the studio boss (via Google Translate), Vávra wanted to "move on," adding that he had been wanting to try something different for a long time. "You won’t see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense he is still part of Warhorse."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That something new is a film adaptation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Vávra and Frývaldský are working on getting it onto "the screen or the big screen," and there’s already a draft script for it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway," the studio boss said. "We don’t just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-shutting-down-ugc-dungeon-brawler-king-of-meat-after-six-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Amazon shutting down UGC dungeon brawler King of Meat after six months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As CzechCrunch reports, the film project goes in tandem with an organizational transformation of the company, which now has almost three hundred employees. Viktor Bocan and Prokop Jirsa are now creative directors responsible for game development, with Frývaldský and Martin Klím being joined by Victor Höschl as art director and Martin Štýs as CTO.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of goals and ambitions, Frývaldský said it is important for the studio to reach “a similar audience as the game,” whether with a film or a series. This means the United States, Western Europe, and Asia.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We would have to be blind if we didn’t realize how much our brand has grown," the studio boss added. "In fact, Vávra’s new position could be called transmedia director.
