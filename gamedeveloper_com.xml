"We oversee a diverse portfolio of over 40 companies, including several significant media outlets like Echo24, Týdeník Echo, Hrot magazine, and Radio Prostor," he said. "Most of our operations are structured under the SPM holding company, though Parlamentní listy remains a separate entity."

Czech video game sales analyst Avi Duda told Game Developer they "weren't surprised" by the purchase, nodding toward donations made by Pavlíček to the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy political party (SPD), whose members are often favorably covered by Parlamentní listy. Španěl acknowledged those donations in his interview with Seznam Zprávy, noting he personally supports Svobodní and Civic Democratic Party (ODS), both traditional conservative parties tacking toward the center and center-right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They're of course free to do whatever they want and purchase any media, but buying this to prove to others that having different opinions is ok seems very short-sighted," Duda said. "I don't see a difference in what's written in the website now and what was written there before they owned it. It's always the same eyebrow-raising content with a bunch of straight up lies. They should know better than that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As The Czech Republic becomes a bigger player in the global game development market (Czech developer Warhorse Studios managed to sell a million copies of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-launches-1-million-copies-sold">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the day it launched), the role its leaders play in public life is having a greater and greater impact. That they've chosen to back a publication criticized for its alleged pro-Russian stance as Russia wages a physical and propaganda war against its rivals gives developers reason to ask what kind of role Španěl and Pavlíček wish to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, that role appears to be an expansion of the pair's media portfolio. "Parlamentní listy was neither our first nor last media investment," Španěl said.
