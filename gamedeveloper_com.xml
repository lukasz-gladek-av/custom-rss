Since being acquired by the Xbox maker in November 2018, the Irvine outfit has released an impressive roster of titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A sequel for the latter will be dropping in October.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio's other sophomore effort, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is already available in Xbox Game Preview and Steam Early Access. But what pushed Obsidian to revisit the little-becomes-large world of Grounded with so many other irons already in the fire?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two words: Insect mounts.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During an interview with Game Developer on Gamescom 2025 show floor, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game director Chris Parker and creative director Justin Vazquez from Eidos-Montreal—which is co-developing the sequel alongside Obsidian—suggested the title might not exist if players hadn't insisted upon bestriding bugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This was the main feature we wanted to bring to the game," says Vazquez. "It was the number one request from the community and it was the biggest justification as to why we wanted to create a new world in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even if the team had wanted to do it in the first one, the world wasn't built to support it."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vazquez explains that mounts, appropriately named 'Buggies' by the dev team, had to be designed hand-in-hand with the environment itself. "We often say we couldn't have done Buggies without the park, and we couldn't have done the park without Buggies," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, it might sound like a mechanic that's fairly easy to implement. But adding mounts to a title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> impacts the experience in a massive way. Parker explains that if you make Buggies too fast, then traversing on foot instantly becomes punishing. But, if they feel too sluggish, you'll have players questioning why they were included in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once you've figured out how fast you want the Buggie to go, then you have to figure how far apart you want the different point of interest in the world" he continues. "Then you have to tune both of these things hand-in-hand at the same time. You have the same sorts of issues with combat. Once you start fighting stuff, you're balancing for both on-foot combat and Buggie combat."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Parker says that Buggie combat had players feeling "invulnerable" during early tests and nobody was dismounting to explore as a result. The development team quickly readjusted, but then found they'd made Buggies too weak. In the playtests that followed, nobody used Buggies at all.&nbsp;"You get into these tug-of-wars with balance that was really quite challenging," adds Parker.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/unlocking-the-vault-designing-shadow-complex" target="_self" data-discover="true">How 'playful paper prototyping' paved the way for Shadow Complex - Unlocking the Vault #1</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early access development is about unearthing &quot;identifiable and actionable problems&quot;">Early access development is about unearthing "identifiable and actionable problems"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early access is a blessing and a curse when fighting those battles. Vazquez says the more time you spend in early access, the more feedback you receive. That can be incredibly useful, but as production gathers pace and more and more systems come online, it can also become overwhelming.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why it's vital to be intentional when introducing new features to players—even when you're in the middle of that early access process. "That's the balance we have to find. When is a feature complete and ready enough that we feel getting it into players hands will be valuable and still feel like a complete experience for them, but isn't so finished that there isn't room for the community to give their feedback and put their stamp on it?" Vazquez adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Buggie is a really good example, because originally we had a ton of ideas about all the different Buggies we wanted to do, but one of the first big questions we asked ourselves was 'how many do we want to do before we get them into players' hands?' The decision was made to do just two as well as possible and hand those over to players so we could get really meaningful feedback that will help influence our future Buggies."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-developers-can-learn-from-the-indie-social-co-op-games-topping-the-steam-charts" target="_self" data-discover="true">What developers can learn from the indie social co-op games topping the Steam charts</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parker says separating useful feedback from the cacophony of noise is a "tricky process." He explains Obsidian has a comms group that helps the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">team sort through everything the community is saying. The studio also uses Discord bots to let fans vote on gameplay features and other additions. The development team then gathers once a week to discuss those requests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kind of reprocess [the feedback]," says Parker. "We need to understand, when a player finds something good or difficult or whatever, whether that's a symptom of another problem. [...] By addressing this thing, will we fix that? There's a lot of philosophical conversation that goes into that."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Vazquez, early access is about translating the feelings of players into "identifiable and actionable problems" the development team can address.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How long will it actually take to balance all of those equations is anybody's guess. Parker explains he's unsure whether there's an "optimal" early access timeframe, but says it's important for people to have dates and goals to shoot for so they can evaluate their progress. He does, however, confirm that he doesn't want </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to still be kicking around in early access in five years time, so expect a full launch before 2030.

Word on the street is that developers at both Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative were given a chance to salvage the title by seeking a new funding partner. Yet, despite talks initially progressing with a range of suitors including Grand Theft Auto owner Take-Two Interactive, disagreements regarding who would take ownership of the franchise seemingly created an impasse. The end result? More people out of work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Video game journalists, much like developers, have been subject to a debilitating deluge of layoffs of late. Since the turn of the year, those under the umbrella of media conglomerates like Valnet and Ziff Davis have been kicked to the curb in the wake of major acquisitions. The solution for many has been to shun corporate ownership entirely and kickstart independent publications. Enter Rogue, a new worker-owned outlet established by seven former Polygon staffers. The website was formed in partnership with Rascal and will dish out news, guides, interviews, and more. Some articles (including most news and guides) will be free, while other content will be locked behind a subscription. The upshot of that reader-supported model, according to the founding team, is that advertisements and sponsored articles will be consigned to history. How does that sound?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">More layoffs, this time at Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven.
