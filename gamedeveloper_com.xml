            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/reflections-on-my-score-for-tactical-breach-wizards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Within this article, I will be going over various aspects of my score for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> including my creative process, inspirations, experiences, challenges, and reflections post-release. I hope that this gives hopeful composers some behind-the-scenes insight into the production of a full game score.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Creative process and vision">Creative process and vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I feel like the biggest obstacle for any score, whether it’s a film, game, or other type of media, is to land the vision correctly and stay true to it.&nbsp; When I sent my work to Tom over at Suspicious Developments when he announced the composer opening, the two tracks that helped me stand out were two trailer tracks I had written that heavily used percussion. With that in mind, I wanted to ensure that percussion was at the forefront when the game called for more serious or dramatic music mixed with orchestral and sometimes electronic elements.&nbsp; It helped that I was a trailer composer, so I had access to a fair bit of trailer samples to bring some punch and intensity.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> there are four main acts and a prologue to start the game, showing the last mission between Liv and Zan.&nbsp; Along with the references Tom had sent to me, I also wanted to try to give each act a different direction while staying true to the vision of the overall score, sometimes with different instrumentation focuses, such as Act 1 (DSR) having a lot of synths and a lead electric guitar, a choir for when dealing with Chapel in Act 3 (Kalan), and using bells to put the players in a historical setting in Act 4 (Medil).&nbsp; The prologue is more of an opening sequence made of two more orchestral tracks with some of my favorite trailers, SFX.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two outliers with the vision of the overall soundtrack were “At Ma’s” and “The Necromedic,” which were Reggae and Jazz, respectively.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Technical challenges">Technical challenges</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it came to the challenges of writing the soundtrack, at times, I was my own worst enemy, which I will talk more about later in this article.&nbsp; At times, my own tools led to limits I had to overcome.&nbsp; Sometimes, it was my production level at the time.&nbsp; The challenges all led me to find creative ways to overcome them, and eventually, they all went away fairly quickly.&nbsp; Don’t be afraid to face them head-on, as you may be surprised by what you can do.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Influences">Influences</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, the score was meant to have different militaristic elements mixed with elements that worked well with the setting.&nbsp; I thought back to older game scores and developed ideas of what I liked from those scores.&nbsp; Some of it was the use of percussion, some of it was the use of synths, and some was the use of strings and brass, which I loved.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember once trying to take the whimsical approach when the players were selecting their perks; however, it didn’t work. There were other moments I attempted it, but it never stuck.&nbsp; I do know that when you think of wizards and magic, you think whimsical and fantasy, but that had no place here!&nbsp; We had a more gritty theme that went with this, though there was a lot of humor around them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Evolving as a composer">Evolving as a composer</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When working on the score, I went through an evolution over the three and a half years I was involved with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp; In ways, my process was all about experimentation with sounds, textures, and themes, but as time went on, my process evolved into a more methodical approach, mainly thanks to my studies with Penka Kouneva, who helped me clean up my methods, have more of a detailed plan with each cue, and most importantly, executing it.&nbsp; I know that has been a common issue, so it was very important for me to get it right.&nbsp; This also showed an evolution of the score with sometimes more complex writing in the latter half of the soundtrack.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, I had really worked on my production skills so I could achieve great results with whatever orchestral libraries and synths I owned at any time.&nbsp; I should also thank developers such as Rocky Mountain Sounds (Complexity, Majestica 2, etc.) for making great libraries and expansions that really contributed to the soundtrack in various ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all that said, all of these changes led to an issue I hadn’t accounted for, such as having to go back to a few older tracks and use what I learned to improve their quality.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if you’re working on a score over the course of several years and are still really developing, you may be in a similar position!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback from players and reflections">Feedback from players and reflections</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of the beta rounds, the feedback was great, but there was one surprise.&nbsp; The Necromedic stood out to many players in a good way, and it showed when looking at the feedback for the score. It was the favorite, which honestly made me chuckle because I didn’t consider my jazz chops to be much to write about.&nbsp; This process has shown me to be open to such nice surprises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The overall reception to the soundtrack upon release had been something I was nervous about as this is one of the first times many people would hear my work, AND they know my name behind it as many other projects I worked on (trailers and films) didn’t thrust me into the open like this one did, especially with that hype around it.&nbsp; I appreciate the great response to the game and the soundtrack, and I hope more people play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as the game is awesome with great writing, level design, art, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I look back at the soundtrack as a whole, I plan to keep using the knowledge gained during the experience and continue writing great scores, as this has so far been my best work. You never truly know how you will handle the challenges thrown at you at work like this until you’re in the thick of it, and I urge everyone to pursue these challenges.&nbsp; I really hope you enjoy the score as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-animal-well-s-home-brewed-engine-was-key-to-its-success<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For most of his development career, Billy Basso has attended gaming conventions on a work and promotional capacity. He'd stand near an incomplete game demo kiosk, watching people play it, taking notes, figuring out if he's on the right track. Analyze, focus, guess, and hope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September, he finally got a taste of the other side of the booth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"PAX West was the first show that happened after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launch," Basso says weeks later from his home studio in Chicago. "I was looking forward to taking, in a way, a victory lap." He describes a crowd of people lining up at the Seattle expo–not to play a new game, but to greet Blasso and share "all of these stories" about their positive experiences with his months-old title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Animal Well's sole coder, artist, and designer, Basso deserves the lap. Since its April 2024 launch on consoles and PCs, the indie "Metroidvania" game has amassed nearly universal acclaim. Sales estimator Gamalytic points to sales figures exceeding 300,000 copies on Steam alone. During its launch month,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/">Animal Well</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at one point outsold every first-party Nintendo game on Switch's eShop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a chat with Game Developer, Basso and his business partner, Dan Adelman, reflect on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s development, launch, and success. What worked? How did surprising fare, like a Wisconsin tourist attraction and the 3D adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows of the Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, inspire and guide the game's unique spin on Metroidvanias? And what might come next?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/creature-feature-the-surreal-pixel-art-and-animation-of-animal-well" target="_self">Creature feature: The surreal pixel art and animation of Animal Well</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Opting out of battles with pre-made engines">Opting out of battles with pre-made engines</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> journey began in two phases, Basso says: a quick stab at a Metroidvania-styled prototype in 2012, and a bespoke engine project that he took more seriously, which he began coding alone in 2014 during his day job's off hours. That day job, to clarify, was programming work at the video game studio Phosphor Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was typically working on mobile games with live service elements that were heavily dependent on network infrastructure," he says. "We were using off-the-shelf game engines that had a lot of bloat and were laggy." Having his own bespoke, offline engine was a priority for whatever kind of game he would eventually make on his own, to avoid the "sour taste" of inefficient tools and workflows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Basso's work on a "general purpose, 3D game engine" dragged on during nights and weekends for three years before he came to a tough conclusion: the engine-focused project had been too focused on "preemptively solving problems," instead of "having enough direction to actually turn into a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was 2017, and some of the design ideas from his 2012 Metroidvania lark had continued pulling on him, so Basso "wrote off" his 3D engine as "a learning experience" and started anew with 2D search action as a priority. Like before, off-the-shelf solutions weren't going to cut it, but at least this time, he had a genre and some design directives in mind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For his new game, he wanted pixels to scale perfectly to a variety of common screen resolutions, along with visual effects that meshed well with his integer-scaled pixel art. He disliked "built-in lighting effects" that developers had to "fight against quite a bit" in engines like Unity: "they have point lights and stuff, they have a smooth gradient, and that clashes with pixel art."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Build your own technology, then let it set the tone">Build your own technology, then let it set the tone</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that baseline in mind, Basso's early project took shape, but roughly one year in, he found it "looked like an NES game, where the art wasn't that striking." Thanks to his full control of the engine and rendering efficiency at the fore, Basso had more wiggle room at this point in development to add what he describes as a crucial technical upgrade: a rim light shader.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;"Everything was now kind of in shadow, but the edges were highlighted, and your character sprite in the bushes got blended in with the foreground tiles in a way that tied it all together," Basso says. "Immediately, when I got that shader working, I'm like, 'This is a unique look."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The inspiration dominos began falling. Basso noticed that his effects' shadow-and-light interplay "informed the stylistic direction" of the game's environments and animals. Newly inspired, he built a "full screen Navier-Stokes fluid simulation" to power the game's smoke and water effects for more haziness and dreaminess, along with more lighting and particle-effect systems, painting more highlights and posterization effects over backgrounds and sprites.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is interesting," Basso recalls thinking, "where I have this high-fidelity physics simulation working, but it's being paired with this, in some ways, primitive pixel art." As Basso's work bounced between design, art, and engine development, "the richness of the game got layered on, and I found the game's tone and identity gradually over that process." Despite his earlier hiccups with a 3D engine, he still recommends an engine-first mentality for new game development: "That opens up a lot of unique creative avenues. Once I get a cool system working, then I can play around with it and see what it allows for."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digging the well with Adelman's aid">Digging the well with Adelman's aid</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With his 2D game in full swing, Basso inadvertently learned about Adelman, a business- and marketing-focused industry veteran, through a pair of interviews in late 2017 and early 2018. Basso appreciated hearing how Adelman had transitioned from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-world-of-goo-an-all-time-indie-darling">revolutionizing Nintendo's digital distribution channels</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to dedicated support for indie devs, particularly for the breakout Metroidvania hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I'm naturally a pretty introverted person, so having someone like him to work with sounded very appealing to me," Basso says. He sent a cold-call email.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In hindsight, Adelman admits that his near-instant email reply turned out to be a bit disingenuous. "What was special enough about [Animal Well] that made me think, 'oh I want to work on this,' versus what it eventually became, were actually very different games," he says on the PAX West 2024 show floor. "I really like both games." The game he originally envisioned landed somewhere between </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VVVVVV </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You Have To Win The Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–since both eschewed combat in favor of exploration, puzzles, and hardcore platforming. For Adelman, the cherry on top was the early game's emphasis on nooks and crannies, which might otherwise be hidden in shadow or other Basso-developed effects: "I really loved finding secret passageways that I walked past, like, four or five times before I noticed them," Adelman says. "Like, oh, this opens up into a whole new area!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Adelman on board, Basso's more richly developed prototypes started getting in front of industry players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s first major reveal came in a small booth at the inaugural Summer Game Fest in June 2022, an in-person event in the wake of the defunct Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3). That event's biggest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> payoff came one week later, as a six-second blip in</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBD3ExFI9_E"> a wrap-up video</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made by popular YouTube creator Jason "Dunkey" Gastrow.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A big leap with BigMode">A big leap with BigMode</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jason, in his normal style, basically shit on the whole event, but he did give us a positive shout-out," Adelman says. "Just from that one mention, our wishlist numbers had a big spike." Shortly after this, Gastrow and his wife Leah traded follows with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team on Twitter, which led to a series of DMs between Adelman and Leah during that September's Tokyo Game Show. Leah requested a playable build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; Adelman asked that it not be used as YouTube or Twitch content. Leah replied that she had something else in mind: "We're starting a publishing label, called BigMode," Adelman recalls her saying. "Would you have any interest in talking about that?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman had not planned to add a formal publisher to the Animal Well development period; after all, he didn't need one for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And the Dunkey YouTube channel's reputation–full of curse words and overt trolling in online games–gave Adelman some pause: "is [Gastrow's] real-life persona the same as his online persona?" (The past few years have seen other YouTube and Twitch creators take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/dr-disrespect-s-ousting-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-devs">huge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> missteps in their own game-publishing efforts.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Adelman and Gastrow's initial conversations were polite and promising. Game promotion and marketing were changing in the years since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Jason's online reach and the couple's genuine enthusiasm filled an information gap for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at this point in development. Jason had made a career out of tapping into a modern gaming audience's attention span–how people engage with new games and pick favorites out of a deluge of indies. If Gastrow saw something special in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he could convince a lot of people to do the same. In short, what a good publisher does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This could be a disaster, or it could be a really good fit," Adelman recalls thinking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(When asked for comment on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s development and success at PAX West 2024, Jason Gastrow replies by repeating the same sentence twice: "I feel like one hundred penguins." It is unclear whether this statement was in line with Gastrow's humorous YouTube persona, or whether he was offering a hint about an undiscovered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> secret, since the game prominently features penguins.)</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Layers&quot; work–but they need to be distinct and appealing">"Layers" work–but they need to be distinct and appealing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">wastes no time hinting at its range of secrets. With no plot or narration, players begin running-and-jumping around a dark, eerie cave. In one direction, players can pick up an "egg" from a treasure chest with no indication of what it means or does. In the other direction, a squirrel runs away, and a rabbit is seen hiding in a seemingly unreachable corner of the screen. Neither of these hints is borne out with prompt clarification, and the mysteries and layers keep coming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that opening beat is nothing compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s "layers" of deeper puzzles. Some required dozens of players' collaboration to figure out, and others required connecting specific hardware to a PC while playing the game. Layers found their way into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a few ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a publishing deal in place and budget settled, Bigmode, Adelman, and Basso agreed not to rush the game's launch–and to let Basso ultimately lead on the development, implementation, and difficulty of the game's crisscrossing puzzles. Basso would often hand a new build to Adelman and the BigMode team without spoiling its four "layers" of puzzles, though the deepest layer was so obtuse that its puzzles simply couldn't be tested by Bigmode's tiny team without cheat codes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This part of the game's development never exceeded Adelman's "scope creep" bandwidth, as he found the deeper puzzle additions never added "bloat" to the development process. Basso would review feedback after each build was turned in and accept "maybe half" of the suggestions. "It wasn't so much like I was asking permission ever to do something," Basso says. "I kind of just did it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Basso, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s deeper layers would have no value unless players connected with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s surface-level content. He drew inspiration from an unlikely 3D-adventure game: 2005's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whose online community eventually began hunting for a "hidden" 17th "colossus" boss (which never existed).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was almost like a religious conviction that they wanted to find this missing part of the game," Basso says. "But then you realize that that's only true because </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of the most finely crafted games ever made, and people care that much because the base game is so compelling."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Basso committed to one principle in particular: none of its items could be considered "staples" in other Metroidvania games. Midway through development, Basso inadvertently realized he'd leaned on children's toys as the game's foundation, including a Slinky, a yo-yo, a bubble wand, and a frisbee—which gave him immediate reference points for their designs, plus the freedom to add clever surprises to each (particularly the bubble wand's unique "climbing" system). Basso likes the "safe bet" nature of the popular toys he picked out: "That's already a proven interaction."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inspiration from The House on the Rock">Inspiration from The House on the Rock</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last step was to coalesce Basso's artistic and design leanings in a way that would make his mysterious world inviting and exciting to explore, not confusing. Basso had his vision catalyzed after visiting</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehouseontherock.com/"> The House on the Rock in Wisconsin</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It's this ramshackle collection of weird objects that the original owner of the house collected, and he built all these expansions to store them all," Basso says. "You can go in any direction and find cool stuff to look at. It's always surprising, and you can't really predict what the through line is between all of them, but it still feels consistent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basso says he wanted to make "the video game version" of the tourist attraction, though his version would include an unspoken mythology defined by "all the weird, Midwestern lawn ornaments I was seeing in my neighborhood." This explains some of the game's atypical animals standing amongst overgrown, lawn-like weeds (hello, pink flamingos), but Basso also describes an effort to keep his game's animals as unique as its items.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basso admits leaning towards a cast of animals in the game because he finds them "more enjoyable" to draw than humans, and that he can have more creative license since people on average are "more forgiving about the [visual] details, about what they look like." His initial impulse was to draw "more zoo animals," Basso says. "There's a zebra in the [early versions]. And there's just some, like, bears."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the game's more mysterious tone took shape, Basso began watching nature documentaries on YouTube, then found himself compelled by the weirder, less popular animals he saw. "I remember learning that the beluga whale can imitate the sound of children underwater," Basso says. "They trick a lot of divers into thinking there's a child drowning." He might have otherwise picked a better-known creature to fit whatever biome he needed (water, forest, cavern, etc.), but documentaries shaped his excitement: "Oh, I like this detail. That's scary and creepy and interesting." He thus filled out the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Community matters—with a pre-release twist">Community matters—with a pre-release twist</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman admits that before working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he'd never focused pre-release efforts on the concept of community, and he was particularly ambivalent about one popular service, which he'd seen other game developers adopt for their own games with mixed success. "I guess we've got to start up a Discord server and hope people show up," Adelman recalls initially thinking. But in the game's run-up, Basso hid a number of puzzles across the game's promotional channels, including videos and website posts–all hinting to the caliber of puzzles that would eventually debut in the game's deeper layers. The resulting Discord engagement was immediately massive.&nbsp; "These ARGs brought a lot of people together, and friendships started to form," Adelman says. "So I was like, 'Oh, I get what [people] mean now, when they talk about building community.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before that full community could coalesce, Adelman elected to test one unique version of "community": a pre-release, critics-only Discord channel. In addition to giving critics a few weeks to play the final game, Adelman wanted to provide a meeting place for critics to "share information and collaborate on certain puzzles," admitting that Basso's design vision always included an expectation of community-driven puzzle solving. (In other words: it's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cheating to ask for Animal Well help!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This had two outcomes for the very small </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development team: First, the developers could see in real time a miniature version of how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be digested by a community at large–something that couldn't necessarily be replicated by a dedicated QA team. Second, it arguably bumped the game's review scores. "I think if everyone had been playing in isolation, they might have missed out on some things," Adelman says. "Sometimes a reviewer would say, 'I just found this,' and everyone would be, like, 'What?! I gotta look for that." We might have gotten a lot of 7 out of 10s, 8 out of 10s, if people didn't seek out some of the more interesting content or didn't know where to find it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Not &quot;niche,&quot; but &quot;intense&quot;">Not "niche," but "intense"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The community's response to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s pre-release ARG puzzles gave Basso confidence to build complex puzzles for the final game, and that community responded even more fiercely to the final retail game. "People really appreciated the secrets in the game," he says. "I'd assumed there'd be a hardcore group of people that that appealed to. And most people would just enjoy the game. Maybe that is the case, but I think everybody that did experience those deeper, later parts of the game, they all seemed to really resonate with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, when the game's deepest riddles were uncovered by the community–particularly a cypher whose only hint is the pixel-long direction a bunny's ears are turned–Adelman and Basso admit they were shocked by how quickly it happened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman suggests the internal estimate for full puzzle discovery was somewhere around ten years. "There were so many people who were so passionate about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that there were probably, you know, ten man-years dedicated in that condensed amount of time," Adelman says. "It was just way more people working way harder on [the game's puzzles] than we ever expected." (Basso insists that "there are some things the community hasn't found" in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but has not elaborated further.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Basso speaks to trusting his development instincts, he confirms that he's "thinking about another game" and is thus in the "very early stages of setting a new project and engine up." He intends to deliver something similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s scope, if not something "bigger."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm looking forward to releasing a game within the context of having already released Animal Well," Basso says. "I think I'll have more flexibility with how it is marketed, and it will be fun to play off, and subvert, existing fans' expectations." And he clarifies that the afterglow of Animal Well's launch, including a "victory lap" where feedback has moved from comment sections to critical accolades and real-life lines, made years of solo-development isolation worth it. He had ultimate control over its tools, engines, art, and mechanics. Now, and forever, he says that's out of his hands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Animal Well was this sort of pure side project where I could implement things in what I felt was the ideal way," Basso says. "Robust, not dependent on things. [The result was] a timeless quality that older cartridge games have–that still have, like, really intense speed running communities. I wanted to make a game that, you know, could still have a fandom around it 30 years from now."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
