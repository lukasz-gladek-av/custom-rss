Video games have finally pushed me over the edge. It feels like I have been smashing my cranium against a brick wall for eternity without making such much as a dent. Each wobbly step forward only results in disappointment and dismay. Sure, I've seen some neat stuff along the way, but was it all worth it? Is this all there is? The infinite trudge.

You've been seeing this headline making the rounds all week, but allow me to refresh your memory because I think this it's going to take a while to sink in. U.S. publisher Electronic Arts—the publisher behind a preposterous number of major franchises like The Sims, Battlefield, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, EA Sports FC, and more—is being acquired for $55 billion by a consortium of private investors that includes Saudi wealth fund PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. That last one is the investment firm established by U.S. president Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, so EA has essentially been bought by a nation plagued by human rights abuses and the star spangled lunatic's lackey.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/workers-at-disco-elysium-studio-za-um-have-unionized" target="_self" data-discover="true">UK workers at Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM have unionized</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="EA says $55 billion take-private won't result in 'immediate' layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-55-billion-take-private-won-t-result-in-immediate-layoffs">EA says $55 billion take-private won't result in 'immediate' layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Here's a chaser to wash down that shot. Shortly after announcing its $55 billion take-private, EA published an internal FAQ sent to reassure employees there won't be any "immediate" layoffs in the wake of the deal. The company also pledged to foster a culture of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork' under its new owners. Those are purportedly the same values it currently cherishes, although we noticed that EA didn't use words such as "inclusion" and "diversity"—which are, at the time of writing, plastered all over the company's People and Culture page.

It's hard not to balk at a studio laying off workers just months after declaring unprecedented success, but that's the modern video game industry in a nutshell.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
