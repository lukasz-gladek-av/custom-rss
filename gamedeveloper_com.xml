The AI tools didn't end up saving the company money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cecil </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/broken-sword-designer-charles-cecil-says-criticism-of-bespoke-ai-tool-is-frankly-ludicrous-">spoke to Game Developer in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about Revolution Software's intention to use AI tools to both reduce "drudgery" for artists </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to save money. He said at the time that the tool—which he described as "laying the foundation" for artists who then add "their own touches"—does in 10 minutes what would take an artist an hour. It also cost a lot less, he said at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That costs about 20 percent of what it would do without AI," Cecil told Game Developer in 2023. "So, of course that's a consideration, but it's also about eliminating drudgery. To put this tool into the same category of some others is frankly ludicrous."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But looking back on development in his conversation with GamesIndustry.biz, Cecil said that the AI tool's result was not "enormously satisfactory." Asked whether it was an "expensive mistake" to commit to AI tools, Cecil said yes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/silent-hill-f-doesn-t-add-any-iconic-characters-and-that-s-fine-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Silent Hill f lacks 'iconic' characters - and that's fine?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He continued: "It just wasn't appropriate for us." Revolution Software artists instead redrew the backgrounds for the remake, he told GamesIndustry.biz. "It took more time, but you got better results," he said. "So for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we've just done that, we are not using any sort of form of AI as far as the backgrounds and as far as the character sprites [are concerned]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, not all the AI tools it used were a bust: Cecil told GamesIndustry.biz that the studio used "enhancement software" to improve "horribly compressed dialogue recordings" from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The tool, dxRevive from Accentize, uses "highly optimized algorithms based on artificial neural networks" to enhance sound recordings, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.accentize.com/dxrevive/">according to its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only problem was that the studio found the tool right before release; it had to patch the game to update the audio.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cecil previously said AI was vital to remastering ">Cecil previously said AI was vital to remastering <span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI tool used for the 2024 game was created with the University of York; and it was fed only data that's owned by Revolution Software, Cecil told Game Developer in 2023. He defended the use of the tool as something that would increase creativity for the team.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/tencent-claims-its-new-ai-tool-will-reduce-art-production-timeframes-from-days-to-minutes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tencent claims its new AI tool will reduce art production timeframes from days to minutes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am going to defend to the heavens the fact that AI is able to do most of this work, and then a human gets involved and brings in their creativity," he said. "We have human artists using their creative talents to create facial expressions, correct animations, and finesse the details, but the base work is no longer needed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cecil told GamesIndustry.biz that he made statements like that in "good faith at the time," but that the controversy some of it caused wasn't necessarily a bad thing. "And I think that actually if you are taking a game that is 30 years old and you are reforging it, you're enhancing it, actually having a little bit of controversy is not a bad thing, because it makes it feel relevant, it makes it feel contemporary," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s reforged edition, Revolution Software is relying on Philippines-based animators, some of whom worked with Fil-Cartoons on the original game released in 1997, Cecil told </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the rest of the interview, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ai-was-an-expensive-mistake-charles-cecil-on-innovation-insolvency-and-broken-sword">which you can read in full at GamesIndustry.biz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Cecil reflected on Revolution Software's history—the struggles it faced under publisher THQ and how it stayed afloat in recent years self-publishing its own works.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/unity-promises-stronger-ai-copyright-guardrails-after-employee-conjures-mickey-mouse-on-stream" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity promises strong AI copyright 'guardrails' after employee conjures Mickey Mouse on stream</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Revolution Software relied on Kickstarter backers for its recent games, as well as its back catalogue sales, which are "a decimal point" for big publishers, but "really good" for Revolution Software, Cecil said. Revolution Software has had to contend with its financial woes, like the rest of the industry, and the push to AI was part of that cost-conscious nature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't work out, but Cecil linked the "expensive mistake"—that he didn't know would be a mistake, of course—to the resurgence of the franchise. "If I'd known how expensive it was going to be to [make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], there is no way that we would've ever had the balls to actually do it," he told GamesIndustry.biz.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/broken-sword-s-ai-upscaling-wasn-t-enormously-satisfactory-]]></content:encoded>
