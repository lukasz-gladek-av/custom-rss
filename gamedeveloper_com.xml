Through the simple act of taking a photo, photography games and photo modes implore us to notice our surroundings, document our experience, and take a moment to commit to memory the images and emotions that we felt along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To better explore those connections and mechanics, Game Developer is publishing a series of new articles digging into the topic, and highlighting some classics as well. Come along with us as we take a look at the history of photography in video games and its popular uses within the genre and preview the new interviews, essays, and deep dives publishing in the days to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll be highlighting reader-submitted articles throughout the week and there’s tons of great stuff to look forward to, like an essay from Beasts of Maravilla Island developer Michelle Olson about eschewing photographic critique, an interview with the developers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre on why they went with the free release of an idyllic photography minigame as a prequel to their horror title, and a poignant feature from our senior editor Bryant Francis on what basic photography tips can teach us about making better photo modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll also be revisiting interviews, blogs and features from Game Developer’s recent past, unearthing postmortems from games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-sundae-month-s-pupperazzi">Pupperazzi</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-toem">TOEM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-some-indies-are-approaching-photography-mechanics-in-their-games">interviews with indie developers about how they’re using photography in video games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Stay tuned for insight on how these games are put together and the features that developers find vital to the photography game experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If this topic fascinates you, there’s still time to submit an article to our blog section about photography games and photo modes in video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take a peek at our blog submission guidelines and FAQ, head over to our blog submission page and send us your thoughts.</span></p></div></div><div data-module="text-box"><h2>The Player Experience of Scoring (&amp; What is a "Good Photo" Anyway??)</h2><div data-module="content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>From 'The eye of the beholder: Measuring player success in photography games' by Michelle Olson</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While scoring photos as a mechanic does provide extra feedback on the player’s actions, and can create ways for content to be gated or progression to be measured, it creates a very specific mindset when one is taking photos in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To me, this type of photography feels more like client work, rather than artistic expression. Not only is there a prompt of what to take a picture of, but there are strict guidelines on how that subject should be photographed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Pokemon Snap offers some variety by providing different opportunities to photograph the same subject in different environments, players aren’t able to have full freedom of composition.</span></p></div></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Wk - Blog Spotlight" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Featured Blog</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-eye-of-the-beholder-measuring-player-success-in-photography-games" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">The eye of the beholder: Measuring player success in photography games</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">An exploration on how different photography games measure player progress, and how to balance progression metrics and artistic freedom.</p></div></article></div><div data-module="text-box"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, there are often ways to achieve the “best” shot - a particular photo of a particular behavior that will always be worth more points than any other photo a player takes with the same subject. While these moments are often adorable and lovely, it creates an opportunity where one very specific composition is incentivized, and disincentivizes taking other interesting photos of the same subject.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a totally valid way of approaching this type of gameplay - to give a prompt, and ensure the player captures the prompt to the specifications of what the game wants to see. In essence, this “gamifies” the art of photography.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, I think it’s important to ask ourselves as designers of photography games - do I want this to feel like client work? Or do I want this to feel like artistic expression? Either is appropriate, so long as we are deeply intentional about it.</span></p></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Week - Manual Highlight 1" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Sweet Snaps &amp; Expressive Edits</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/alekon-lets-players-make-the-picture-perfect-photo-album" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">Alekon lets players make the picture perfect photo album</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">This Pokémon Snap-inspired game uses robust photo editing tools to create an expressive space for players.</p></div></article></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Wk - Spotlight 2" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Dynamic Photos in a 2D World</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-how-custom-tools-made-the-2d-photo-mode-of-a-highland-song-sing" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">Deep Dive: How custom tools made the 2D photo mode of A Highland Song sing</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">Photography isn't just for 3D games.

Before I was in TV and Film production, I was in film school. Before I ever shot a moving picture, I took a photography course, and before I took that photography course, my Grandfather, Larry S. Cohan, taught me how to shoot photos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Fall 2009 he was published a (still-archived) story called "Better Photos—No Cost" in a Maryland magazine called Outlook by the Bay, a publication for senior citizens of the Chesapeake Bay region. It documents the basics of photography he didn't just share with me but seemed obsessed with everyone having some understanding of.</span></p></div></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Wk - Blog Spotlight 2" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">From the Editors: Bryant Francis</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-to-help-players-shoot-better-in-game-photos-for-no-cost" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">What basic photography tips can teach us about making better photo modes</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">Advice for 'mature Marylanders' can be good for players too.</p></div></article></div><div data-module="text-box"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of his grumpiness still drips off the page. "Don't bore your friends with photos that would bore you if they weren't your own," he wrote. "If you're shooting the sunrise over Bar Harbor, Maine, don't try to include your half-asleep spouse." Sarcasm was a second language for Grandpa, but I remember he seemed sincerely frustrated at how his peers didn't understand the basics of photography, equaled only by his frustration of how they were intimidated by computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Photography Week, I revisited his guide and thought about how he was trying to teach fellow retirees better ways to take shots. They're good tips—ones I still think about when having fun in a photo mode like the ones in Pacific Drive, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, or Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're so good, in fact, that they could help you make a better photo mode for your next game.</span></p></div><div data-module="content-cards"><p data-testid="content-cards-header"><h3 data-testid="contentCardsTitle">From the Archives: Photography Game Classics</h3></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also noted that its Versus Evil subsidiary continues to underperform and has delayed three of four upcoming titles until 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Since the publication of the Company's interim results in September 2023, the market has deteriorated further and negotiations of certain large contracts have extended into the final month of the year," reads the trading update.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These remain under negotiation and may not be signed by year end, or at all. The continued underperformance of Versus Evil which delayed into 2024 three out of four games originally planned for release in H2 2023, including the widely anticipated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Roads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also weighed on group performance."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of November 2023, Tinybuild had around $5.7 million in cash but expects that stockpile to "decline further due to limited cash inflow from October sales, one-off charges as part of the cost reduction plan and underlying software development investments due in December."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tinybuild's &quot;incredibly challenging year&quot;">Tinybuild's "incredibly challenging year"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tinybuild CEO Alex Nichiporchik explained a combination of those factors has turned 2023 into an "incredibly challenging year" for the publisher, and conceded the company ultimately failed to overcome some significant hurdles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The whole team at Tinybuild worked tirelessly to release our best products, despite the impact of the war in Ukraine that deeply affected most of us. We couldn't overcome weak demand for video games and the sudden reversal of market dynamics that had favored us over the previous years. We innovated in marketing, refocused our catalogue, and adjusted the cost base as quickly as possible, and, despite these actions, it wasn't enough in such a rapidly evolving market," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Confirming the layoffs, Nichiporchik said it's "physically painful to part ways with colleagues" who have worked tirelessly for Tinybuild, but indicated the cuts are essential if the company hopes to bounce back during a "pivotal stage."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am committed to do everything I can to ensure we get through this tough period. We owe it to all our stakeholders now to bounce back and deliver on what Tinybuild can achieve," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Tinybuild said the outlook for the next fiscal year remains "cautious" due to the likelihood of "continued pressure on discounting in a crowded market for new releases."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The planned launch of certain promising games in 2024 gives reason for optimism and this coupled with a leaner cost base could translate into strong operating leverage in the event of a recovery in video games sales," concludes the update.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

He also wants to JP to recreate his experience of working with&nbsp;international developers back when he was&nbsp;at Square Enix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Final Fantasy] created opportunities for me to get to know game creators from not only Taiwan but the whole Asian region,"&nbsp;he explained.
