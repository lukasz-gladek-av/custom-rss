            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Boasting an expansive roster of playable heroes and villains from across the Marvel multiverse, many with bespoke mechanics, Marvel Rivals presented developer-publisher NetEase games with a myriad of technical challenges to overcome, especially when optimizing the hero shooter for consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tieyi Zhang, a senior graphics engineer at NetEase Games, hosted a talk at GDC this year to demystify the process behind one specific mechanic: Doctor Strange's portals. If you haven't seen these portals in action in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Doctor Strange can open a portal from where he's standing to anywhere on the map within a certain distance. That portal will (in most circumstances) show where players will end up after passing through once the portal is placed. They work and look very similar to those seen in the recent Doctor Strange movies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although teleporting a player from one point of three-dimensional space to another already presents technical challenges for the device rendering the environment, the talk mostly focused on a greater challenge: how NetEase managed to render multiple angles of the same environment at the same time with minimal frame loss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhang walked the audience through the many steps of the rendering techniques used to produce the effect, discussed the inspirations behind the effect, and showed the differences in frame rate between various iterations of the technique during his talk.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/save-the-saves" target="_self" data-discover="true">Converting saves, a cross platform journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He started the talk by showing how the mechanic functioned when using a tool baked into Unreal Engine called Scene Capture 2D, which works like a virtual camera without any optimization changes. He introduced the tool, saying, “For those of you who are familiar with [Unreal Engine 5], the go-to solution for portals is the Scene Capture 2D component. As a built-in tool, it is perfectly documented and supported by many tutorials,” before going on to praise the tool’s “Consistent visual quality in creating captured content.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the tool’s apparent reliability, the frame rate dropped drastically as Doctor Strange passed through the portal in the videos shown in Zhang’s slideshow. The example shown onstage exhibited a doubled required rendering time, causing the game’s frame rate to plummet to roughly half. However, this could vary in extremity based on the complexity of lighting in the scene. Regardless, given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competitive bent, dropped frames during a match can be fatal, especially in such a competitive landscape where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/15-percent-of-steam-users-played-2024-s-game-releases">less than one fifth of active PC players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> play new titles.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/deep-dive-crafting-detailed-and-dynamic-water-in-planet-coaster-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Deep Dive: Crafting detailed and dynamic water in Planet Coaster 2</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It Takes Two"><span>It Takes Two</span> offered a guiding light</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, the engineer dredged up a surprising point of inspiration for his solution to this framerate issue: 2021’s widely acclaimed co-op hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Hazelight’s use of Unreal Engine to render two simultaneous views without drawing an overwhelming amount of power from the computer or console running it led Zheng to utilize a similar rendering technique for the portals. Zheng joked about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s largely airtight framerate, quipping, “Does this game use some kind of magic? I don't know!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using lagless split screen rendering techniques pioneered by Hazelight and EA’s heavy hitter, Zheng worked out an optimized, frame-efficient solution that took advantage of tech that’s usually reserved for local split-screen co-op, essentially placing another player into the game in order to render the view from the other side. This approach allowed NetEase to use the GPU on board the device much more efficiently, drastically decreasing dropped frames. But NetEase pushed things even further by skipping roughly every 5-10 frames per second within the portal, conserving the computer’s power even more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doctor Strange’s portals have proven to be one of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’ most beloved mechanics, with players finding clever placements and strategies that highlight just how versatile this tech can be, including a now-patched exploit that allowed players to essentially trap their opponents inside of a map’s geometry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/6-steps-to-a-successful-playtesting-process-for-an-indie-developer" target="_self" data-discover="true">6 steps to a successful playtesting process for an indie developer</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.

What if Call of Duty was filled with wizards? Suspicious Developments creative director Tom Francis barely even remembers where the joke originally started, but it helped him and his team build out the foundation for one of 2024's success stories: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The joke was combined with a simple idea—what if there was an XCOM alternative that was easier to parse so that casual players could jump in smoothly?—to create the core design philosophy behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A game that earned 98% positive reviews on Steam and doubled the revenue of Suspicious Developments' previous game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis held a short talk about the variety of "cheats" he used to turn one joke into a 15 hour tactical adventure at the Game Developers Conference.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cheats for jokes">Cheats for jokes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The core premise for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was so simple that Francis and team put their brains together and combined "tactical" and "wizardry" words to create ideas for characters. It was a process—and their first "cheat"—they called their joke engine, or a system that came up with jokes quickly and easily. They came up with and illustrated characters like a "Riot Priest" that would eventually become full on characters in their game alongside the likes of the Traffic Warlock and the Necro Medic.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis's cheats detailed how several well known writing methods worked for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Methods like dialogue trees that put the player's sense of humor first, word-by-word text that helped timed-based jokes hit in stride, character-based comedy that doubled as both jokes and context, and the idea that jokes should be told with the lowest amount of friction possible. Don't put a ton of work into a single joke—or take your player on a detour—to avoid letting them down in a big way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis detailed one joke, in which two players are hugging a wall as they prepare to breach a room, where one character starts trash talking someone that she noticed inside. The character on the other side of the door could hear her and a speech bubble popped up as he said, "wow, Jen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">We got a ton of value out of that out of very little cost," Francis said. "It doesn't matter if it bombed, because we didn't take much effort to get there."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Moving beyond the joke">Moving beyond the joke</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may be a game built off a joke, Francis emphasized that you can't stop there. Some games that have nothing but jokes exist and do well, but others that want to inspire empathy and emotion have to dig deeper to work with the player. This led to another cheat, including the idea that parody doesn't give a license to repeat a genre's mistakes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I like military action games, but their views don't align with mine," Francis said, adding that he couldn't set his game within a different genre, because it wouldn't align with the premise of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We wanted a Tom Clancy-like universe with wizards, so we needed it to look like a Tom Clancy universe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis felt that the majority of military games shared the idea that "killing people is cool, as long as they are foreigners," and wanted to give players something vastly different. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't revolve around a national military fighting foreign enemies or terrorists, it has a group of criminals fighting a theocracy. It focused on punching up.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Telling a story with cheats">Telling a story with cheats</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The process of choosing how to tell a story in a game is just as complicated, if not far more complicated, then whatever story you choose to tell in a game. Games offer a massive variety of tools to deliver a story to the player, which is why Francis provided a third and final set of cheats during this talk that included the idea that comedy and magic can let you get away with nearly anything and two methods to effectively deliver context and dialogue to players: breach conversations and conspiracy boards.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/encouraging-player-creativity-in-caves-of-qud" target="_self" data-discover="true">Encouraging player creativity in Caves of Qud</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A special type of mission exists throughout </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> called an anxiety dream, and it is exactly what you think it is. Each character has a dream mission where they talk to and fight alongside another version of themselves. It gives the player deep insight into that character's thoughts and feelings that wouldn't be possible in any other mission in the game. There would be no reason for those players to share those feelings elsewhere.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A glimpse of each character's private life goes a long way," Francis said, as he admitted that the mere idea of an anxiety dream felt ludicrous to him. It was accepted because magic gives developers a license to get away with almost any ridiculous idea.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After breaking down many of the writing methods that he and his team used to flesh out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Francis also detailed two production design ideas that made the delivery of that writing much smoother.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first was the main setting for the game, breaches. Throughout the game characters follow the same mission and dialogue structure: they line up right outside a door, share a bit of dialogue, and then breach the room. That happens several times within a single mission, giving characters multiple opportunities to share quick and witty bits of dialogue. It's a major reason why many players found the game's jokes natural and funny.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis ended his talk by showcasing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> conspiracy board, which laid out the game's plot like an evidence board with pins and string in a police station. It was a simple way for the players to recap the story, cement the ideas the story presented, and reinforce that the story was taking place in a larger world. He encouraged the developers of any game with a story to have a similar mechanic that would help visual learners keep track of what was happening while they were playing.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
