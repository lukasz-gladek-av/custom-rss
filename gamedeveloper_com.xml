"Is there light at the end of the tunnel?," he asked. "Is there a reason to think, is there a factor that would occur that would cause those losses to come down and when would that be? But maybe more importantly, what is going to cause those losses to come down?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed Reality Labs is focused on becoming more efficient but also needs the capacity to "distribute and grow very quickly" as new technologies—such as its AI-powered smart glasses—gain traction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they’re often selling 10 million units and scaling from there. And I'm not sure if we’re going to do exactly that, but I think that that’s like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ncsoft-invests-in-austin-based-studio-emptyvessel" target="_self" data-discover="true">NCSoft invests in TX-based studio founded by id, Naughty Dog alums</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And that's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and then scaling beyond that for the generations after that. So I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to—we're going to get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do. But then as a bunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the number that I just said is just sort of like the near-term milestone, then I think we’ll continue scaling in terms of distribution."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Layoffs, losses, and dwindling hardware sales dominate Reality Labs discourse">Layoffs, losses, and dwindling hardware sales dominate Reality Labs discourse</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the performance of Reality Labs' product slate, Q1 revenue fell by 6 percent year-on-year to $412 million due to lower sales of Meta Quest hardware.
