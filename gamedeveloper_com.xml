As such, any UK-based player who indicates their account age as 18 and over will begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Age verification will be required to retain full access to social features on Xbox, including voice and text chat, as well as game invites. That being said, the restrictions won't take effect until early 2026, so people won't be mandated to go through the verification until then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This one-time process for players in the UK ensures we can continue to provide all players on our platform with age-appropriate experiences," Kunes wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for methods for online verification, these include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, or either a mobile provider or credit card check. "The information players provide during the age verification process is protected with industry-standard encryption and is not stored or used for any other purpose," the statement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Kunes said that Microsoft expects to "roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future," clarifying that there is "no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety," so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. "We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn’t take away from the Xbox gameplay experience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-" target="_self" data-discover="true">The IGDA calls wave of adult game delistings a form of 'creative suppression'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eligible players who don't verify their age will only be able to use social features on Xbox with friends only until they do so. According to the announcement, the verification process won't impact any existing purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The UK Online Safety Act continues to permeate social media sites">The UK Online Safety Act continues to permeate social media sites</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in June, Ofcom, the media regulator for the UK Online Safety Act, announced that "all sites and apps that allow pornography" will need to have "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-for-online-safety--what-you-need-to-know-as-a-user">strong age checks in place</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">."
