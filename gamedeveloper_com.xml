data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Digital Fairness Fitness Check states there are also "significant concerns" surrounding loot boxes and their purported similarities

growth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the DFA is still being finalized, Paananen claims regulations proposed by the Consumer Protection

nightmare."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a

data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paananen suggests in-game currencies are simply akin to tokens that can be purchased at theme parks to access rides and other experiences. He claims it's an approach that is "convenient and fun" for consumers because it helps them avoid "repeated cash transactions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After making that comparison, he suggests the CPC Network and DFA will dismantle that straightforward process to implement new rules that will leave consumers feeling "frustrated and disappointed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With the CPC Network Guidelines, every time a player uses an in-game token—which happens millions of times daily and works just like tokens at a theme park—companies would need to treat every such use as a distinct financial transaction requiring extensive legal processes," he writes. "Meanwhile, a future Digital Fairness Act risks codifying these guidelines into law—ruining the experience for players and families."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paananen claims companies like Supercell—which relies heavily on free-to-play monetization practices—have already made protecting consumers a top priority. For instance, he claims the firm already disincentivises long play after 45 minutes within its online battler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brawl Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/publishers-asked-crisol-theater-of-idols-dev-to-remove-the-game-s-foundational-spanish-folklore" target="_self" data-discover="true">Vermila kept Crisol: Theater of Idols' folklore, even if it scared publishers away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every decision we make is grounded in our mission to make fun, healthy, safe experiences for players of all ages, he adds. "[...] If we don't, we know players will take their time elsewhere."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Paananen claims the proposed regulations could decide the future of Europe's entire video game industry, and has called on his peers to speak out and work constructively with EU decision makers to ensure Europe "remains a continent where digital industries thrive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Rather than implementing sweeping regulations that would cripple the industry and fail to protect players, we should strengthen existing frameworks already putting European gamers first," he continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This would mean that the Digital Fairness Act consultation must include genuine industry engagement. As dialogue with the CPC Network progresses, in-game currencies are currently rightfully recognise as digital content under existing law, and should not be classified as 'digital representations of value.' Most importantly, any new regulations must be based on evidence, not hypothetical assumptions—and be proportionate to the harm."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
