"Our teams all work closely together, even across different titles," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto said. "We're able to share ideas and discoveries and technology with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ongoing rise in popularity for the Monster Hunter franchise was spearheaded by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2018. The global interest, as well as a larger-scale audience, has led Capcom to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity">take in new input</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on where to steer the franchise moving forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From the get-go, we approached Monster Hunter World with a global mindset," Tsujimoto said during an interview at Summer Game Fest 2024. "At that point, we had approached things by releasing in Japan first and following up with other territories, but World was our first worldwide simultaneous release for Monster Hunter. It was also the first game we made with so many forms of localization. That seems obvious to say, but that was a challenge for us initially because, with that global approach, we had to open up the series to other Capcom members across the globe to give opinions and input on the kind of direction the series would be going on."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-publicly-releases-its-proposed-ai-terms-to-end-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA publicly releases its proposed AI terms to end strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the focus has been paying off for the company, its efforts toward live-service games, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Re:Verse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as the latest example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-axing-resident-evil-re-verse-with-steam-concurrent-player-estimates-in-the-single-digits">haven't been as successful</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
