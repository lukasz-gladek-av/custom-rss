A memo listing the layoffs also announced that Rod Fergusson would take over as Cloud Chamber's studio head, a strange mirror to the time he came in towards the end of the last BioShock's development to get it over the line.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Update: Microsoft shuts down questions about layoffs and Israel ties at Gamescom 2025"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-shuts-down-questions-about-layoffs-and-israel-ties-at-gamescom-2025">Update: Microsoft shuts down questions about layoffs and Israel ties at Gamescom 2025</a></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In the original story, your usual Patch Notes author attempted to ask a developer what it was like to work with Microsoft during a turbulent time (given the company's recent mass layoffs, and controversy around its ties to the IDF's military surveillance agency), but the company's spokespeople quashed the question.
