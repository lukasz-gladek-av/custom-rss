As an example, if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream, but not in game over chat or voice comms, we can still issue a penalty as if that behavior occurred in-game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot said its updated terms of service will only apply to content where its titles are featured, but noted it will also cover actions that compromise the competitive integrity of Riot products such as stream sniping and questionable promotions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If a creator is sponsored by a boosting website, promotes ways for players to buy and sell accounts, or otherwise does anything that encourages players to break our rules, we may suspend access to your Riot accounts," continues the post. "This can happen formally, through sponsored posts on social media accounts, videos, or streams, or just in casual conversation that occurs during the course of content."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot added that bad actors who violate its terms of service in particularly egregious ways could be subject to Riot-wide bans. "Problematic behavior in one game may result in penalties across all of our games," said the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/creator-related-updates-riot-privacy-notice-terms-of-service">You can learn more about Riot's updated terms of service by clicking here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
