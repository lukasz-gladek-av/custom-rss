It's remained one of the top-played games on Valve's Steam platform since its release, reaching a peak concurrent player count of 170,759 in mid-August. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is immensely popular—and its playerbase keeps growing. Hitting that 10 million milestone would make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the second "budget indie," as Alinea Analytics called it, to reach that point—the first was another social co-op game: R.E.P.O.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These two titles follow an emergence of social-driven co-op games that have largely been made by independent studios with lower budgets—the likes of Landfall's 2024 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, horror survival game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, multiplayer fishing game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Webfishing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even InnerSloth's social deduction mega-hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Social games are nothing new: Multiplayer is a core element of plenty of video games; games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Minecraft, and Call of Duty are often vehicles for chatting with a group of friends. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>R.E.P.O</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the like, though are something different.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The core appeal of &quot;weirdo social games&quot;">The core appeal of "weirdo social games"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aggro Crab art director Galen Drew told Game Developer that "weirdo social games" like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have existed for some time, pointing back to games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are games you can play with your friends, but these games are ones that are designed around "the experience of hanging out with your friends," Drew said. "It's the expressiveness in the way the characters move and look, and the types of things you can do. It's all just a vehicle to make your friends laugh."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-door-problem-with-liz-england-game-developer-podcast-ep-53" target="_self" data-discover="true">Revisiting The Door Problem With Liz England - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 53</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players clearly want that: The top three new games on Steam, by copies sold, are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>R.E.P.O</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, social co-op drug dealing game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Schedule I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/games-with-co-op-generated-over-4">Alinea Analytics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The firm's estimates suggest that co-op games on Steam brought in $4.1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025; "the highest six-month total ever recorded for the genre," according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/games-with-co-op-generated-over-4">analyst Rhys Elliot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Michael Chu, CEO and co-founder of Treehouse Games, which is making co-op, seafaring survival game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Voyagers of Nera</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, told Game Developer that "there are more great options for co-op games than ever, so the competition feels intense as a developer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He continued: "But a bigger and more diverse audience of players [is] looking to gaming as their favorite way to hang out every year."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that in mind, it makes sense that developers would start to really hone in on that experience—and purpose-build games that give players powerful moments with friends.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/has-tides-of-tomorrow-cracked-the-narrative-multiplayer-formula-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Has Tides of Tomorrow cracked the narrative multiplayer formula?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What to make of &quot;Friendslop&quot;">What to make of "Friendslop"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A new term has emerged to describe the growing genre that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>R.E.P.O</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> find themselves in: "Friendslop." Friendslop was used first in a joke: A Twitter user </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/wooosaaaahhhhh/status/1901717577056780478">posted three pictures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>R.E.P.O</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and called the genre friendslop. "Its sole purpose of existence is friendfarming," they said. The term—or, maybe, a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse">desire to dunk on it on social media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—caught on. Depending on who you talk to, it's used in jest, is insulting to games it's used to refer to, or it's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/peak-steam-landcrab-friendslop-update-interview-nick-kaman-pc">something to embrace</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What is uncontested, though, is the demand for games that are built for socialization, experimentation, and silliness with one's buddies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The core of a friendslop game is where the fun of the game comes from stupid stuff you and your friends do, and a lot of it is driven by the mistakes you make," Drew said of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It's a game where you're all dumb idiots trying to do something difficult and complicated, and failing is the funny part."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aggro Crab and Landfall used the friendslop format but stripped away the horror game roots to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Drew said. Horror is a good fit for the genre because it adds an inherent pressure that ends up being slapstick comedy. There's a performance element to it, too, Drew said. "Horror is an easy pressure to put on those kinds of challenges, because it's just easy to get people flustered and freaking out and making a mistake that's funny," he said. "In the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that's a great mechanic, because filming is a good incentive to even, like, perform the funny."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-makes-ambrosia-sky-so-unique-game-developer-podcast-ep-52" target="_self" data-discover="true">What Makes Ambrosia Sky So Unique? - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 52</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the collaboration between the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makers, the developers wanted to capture a similar feeling but about surviving with friends. There's no horror element to up the ante; instead, the antagonist is the climb—not any sort of looming monster. The mountains themselves are there to lure the player into taking risks and making mistakes, Drew said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Almost every item we add is meant to be tempting to use in a way that's dumb," he said. "Generally, we don't add items that are strictly useful—there are a few, obviously, like the piton or rope. But almost all of them have this built in failure point. You still have to place the piton, and it takes time, and you could fall while you're doing it. The rope, you still have to spool out a certain length, and you don't really have a great idea of how much you're spooling out. They're all intentionally chosen so that your friends are yelling at you because you didn't spool out enough rope when they climb."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A tonal change for the genre">A tonal change for the genre</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chu told Game Developer that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Voyagers of Nera</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is slated for early access in mid-September, will deliver similar sorts of moments. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Voyagers of Nera</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, doesn't necessarily fit under the "genre" of friendslop, despite its similarities in goal—to create moments for friends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We built the game to deliver memorable moments with friends (what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> thrive on), but our game focuses on a different flavor. We wanted to create moments of shared discovery as players explore far off locations together, rescue magical spirits, and battle deep sea monsters. We think there's something romantic and familiar about starting out at the horizon on the ocean and wondering, ‘What's out there?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Voyagers of Nera</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn't necessarily built upon the performance and humor of a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but still hinges on gameplay that encourages socialization. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games more firmly situated in the friendslop world seemingly rely more on sessions than an ongoing experience; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s maps rotate every 24 hours, something that Drew said was a technical constraint rather than an intentional decision. But it's a constraint that Drew said plays into the excitement of playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: People want to see and try the different maps. The rotations become like Destiny raids, he said. There's some fear of missing out on some unique experience, but it's not so exclusive that it drives people away—there's always another day. "It will feel like a special thing every time you [play]," Drew added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Voyagers of Nera</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, on the other hand, is a shared world that lives on a server and up to 10 people per session can come back to it, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rust</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Regardless of the differences, though, the core of the experience remains: "Games have become a default way to spend quality time with friends," Chu said. And games that are built to support these relationships are more popular than ever.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-developers-can-learn-from-the-indie-social-co-op-games-topping-the-steam-charts]]></content:encoded>
