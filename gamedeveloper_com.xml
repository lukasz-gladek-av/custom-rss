            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image by Kateryna via Adobe Stock.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Concerns over the negative impact of generative AI are spreading among game developers. According to new data from the Game Developer Collective, developers are four times more likely to say generative AI technology will negatively impact the quality of games than they were a year ago. It's a rising concern from a community already wary of the technology due to its intense energy usage and lingering questions over the ethics and legality of training data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The statistics—gathered by our peers at Omdia by surveying members of the Game Developer Collective panel—shows a 13 percent increase in the number of developers concerned over product quality. The number rose from 34 percent in 2024 to 47 percent in 2025. Fewer developers expressed positivity about the technology, dipping from an already-scant 17 percent in 2024 to 11 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of respondents who said they were "neutral" on the topic or thought it would have no impact on quality also decreased.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We reached out to experts across the game industry to quiz them on the shift, casting a wide net to look at the topic from different backgrounds. Necrosoft Games founder and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Demonschool</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Brandon Sheffield argued the technology is part of a growing trend of companies "sanding off the edges" of games as an art form. "I'm not just talking about high-minded ideas…I'm talking about something as mechanics-oriented as 'what's a good jump' or 'what does a good assault rifle feel like?'" AI's tendency to replicate content from its training data is the primary weakness Sheffield is concerned with.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games using [genAI] will be more generic, even if that's not immediately discernible to a player."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiddendoor.co/">Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> CEO and founder Hilary Mason—herself a developer experienced with machine learning and genAI—expressed a similar sentiment. "Large Language Models (LLMs) are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>aspirationally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mid," she said, saying that the economic pressure of the games business could incentivize some studios to crank out "mediocre or even slop games" without "care and polish."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King's College senior lecturer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/">Mike Cook</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggested that the shift in perception may not be about the assessment of the tools, but a judgment on the companies using them. "There was a perception that companies didn't really want to use it, and that the tools weren't reliable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we've seen over the past twelve months…is that a lot of companies are using these tools despite their problems and despite the public backlash," he continued. "I suspect a lot more developers are facing situations where they're being asked to make do with AI outputs as 'good enough,' especially when the industry continues to get squeezed and more people lose their jobs."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can AI toolmakers win over game developers?">Can AI toolmakers win over game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If AI toolmakers want to get back in developers' good graces, they might want to lean into the technology's flaws instead of handwaving them away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamesfund.vc/">The Games Fund</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> founder and managing partner Ilya Eremeev (who began his career as a 3D artist, informing his team's decision to invest in Layer.ai) agreed that exposing players to AI-generated content runs the risk driving down perceptions of quality. But he said this trend also shows generative AI is being used in the wrong fields. "There is a lot of unnecessary labor in asset variations, retopology, rigging, localization, QA, code assistance, even design research," he said, arguing that AI can "dramatically speed things up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He's sour on the idea of a "text-to-game" pipeline like the kind Electronic Arts </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">showed off in its 2024 presentation to investors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Describing complex systems in natural language is often harder than building them. You either end up with very abstract results or waste more time than you save."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mason's betting that generative AI has a purpose in making "new kinds" of games—though she makes a more modest pitch for Hidden Door's interactive roleplaying platform, which generates tabletop-like roleplaying prompts that echoes an author's prose. "It's an old game style, now possible in a new form," she said. She and Eremeev both suggested that discoverability tools on game platforms will play a large role in shaping players' views on AI in games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For companies who want their workers to eagerly adopt AI tools—maybe you'd benefit by not "forcing" them on your workers. Cook and Sheffield both echoed with this idea, with the King's College lecturer pointing out that the game industry "doesn't have a good track record of making decisions based on what's best for a game, or listening to feedback from their employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Forcing things on people has never really yielded amazing results," Sheffield quipped. "But this seems to be the only idea [companies] like Microsoft have."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
