The figure of the damages, which is provisionally estimated, is proposed to be up to 656 million pounds ($897.7 million).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/">shared via Routers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> yesterday, after a tribunal in Britain ruled the case could continue. According to the press release, Valve was sued in June 2024 "on behalf of up to 14 million people" in the United Kingdom who "bought games or additional content through Steam or other platforms since 2018."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vicki Shotbolt, a children's welfare advocate, is the person in charge of bringing the case. Shotbolt's lawyers alleged that Valve is preventing publishers from selling products more cheaply or earlier on rival platforms to Steam by imposing conditions on them. For example, the allegations claim the company requires users to buy all additional content through Steam if they've bought the game through the platform, "locking in" users to make purchases on its platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shotbolt's lawyers said at a hearing in October that this allows Valve to charge "unfair and excessive" commissions of up to 30 percent—a figure that has been public knowledge between game developers for years.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/games-that-sell-dlc-and-in-app-purchases-appear-to-benefit-most-from-subscription-services" target="_self" data-discover="true">Games that sell DLC and in-app purchases appear to benefit most from subscription services</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the press release, Valve argued the case should not be certified to proceed towards a trial, an early step in the proceedings. Yet, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled the case could continue. As of yet, no date has been set for the trial.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2021, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overgrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Wolfire Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-overgrowth-i-dev-wolfire-games-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-over-steam-fees">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Valve</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, claiming the "extraordinarily high cut" of revenue Valve takes from Steam developers gave the company an "unassailable" monopoly on PC game distribution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, Wolfire added that Valve uses its market dominance to extract high fees from developers, and pointed out Steam's once-standard 30 percent store fees, claiming the company has "illegally monopolized the market for PC game distribution."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve eventually filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and said its 30 percent sales cut accurately represents the services it provides developers. Then, in late 2021, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wolfire-games-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-has-been-dismissed">the lawsuit was dismissed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. District Judge John C. Coughenour said Wolfire failed to prove that Valve's fees are "supracompetitive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lawsuit was then refiled in 2022, and was eventually combined with a similar antitrust lawsuit filed by Dark Catt Studios. Then, in November 2024, as reported by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status">GamesIndustry.Biz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the studios were granted class action status, transforming the antitrust lawsuit into a potentially much larger dispute. As such, the class action applies to any developers, publishers or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection to a game sale on or after January 28, 2017.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/micro-indie-publisher-pantaloon-closes-pre-seed-funding-round" target="_self" data-discover="true">Micro-indie publisher Pantaloon closes pre-seed funding round</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

The results have been fascinating. Some developers say they're </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-bethesda-exec-pete-hines-claims-subscriptions-services-are-undercutting-developers">crushing the value of games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, others say they're "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/finji-ceo-subscriptions-are-simultaneously-awesome-and-terrifying">awesome and terrifying</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who—besides these big tech giants—is earning extra revenue from the service? According from data from a late 2025 report from the Game Developer Collective (a research project orchestrated by our sibling organization Omdia), it's a specific subset developers whose games are based on selling downloadable content and expansions to players over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Collective organizers asked developers how the inclusion of their most recently-released game on a subscription service has impacted the sales of their game. 17 percent of developers using subscription services reported seeing an increase in in-app purchase and downloadable content sales, while only 4 percent of developers selling premium games reported an increase.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer/Omdia</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not a huge number of developers. Given that the majority of developers selling in-app purchases (IAP), downloadable content, or expansions reported there being "no difference" in revenue (or that they "didn't know"), the broad majority of studios aren't seeing exceptional games. But that 17 percent number indicates there's a category of games that convert subscribers into paying customers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/micro-indie-publisher-pantaloon-closes-pre-seed-funding-round" target="_self" data-discover="true">Micro-indie publisher Pantaloon closes pre-seed funding round</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only question is—what are those kinds of games?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Premium games with post-launch content see revenue boosts on Xbox Game Pass">Premium games with post-launch content see revenue boosts on Xbox Game Pass</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia senior analyst James McWhirter explained to Game Developer that developers making "games that generate long-term play with attractive DLC options" are most likely those reporting improved revenue from a subscription service. He pointed to games like Bethesda Softworks' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starfield</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Rebellion Developments' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sniper Elite Resistance</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, sports titles on EA Play, and Dovetail Games' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Train Sim World 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Xbox Game Pass' status as the most high-profile subscription service for console and PCs, we thought it was worth asking them what games selling IAP and downloadable content are seeing this kind of revenue bump. ID@Xbox Director Guy Richards told Game Developer that Sloclap's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138720/REMATCH/">Rematch</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Sumo Digital and Gun Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433140/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre/">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are two games that fit the bill.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players who tried </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Game Pass also purchased the game before it exited the game pass library. Richards said this partly due to some promotion on Xbox's part that these games would be leaving the service, and that players may want to purchase the game and the available DLC to keep playing. "We work closely with creators to build a custom program to reflect what they need—including promoting DLCs or titles before they exit the service and sharing platform trends and best practices."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-sold-a-record-number-of-video-games-over-the-past-nine-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Capcom sold a record number of video games over the past nine months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gun Interactive CEO Wes Keltner affirmed Richards' findings, pointing to the new characters added to the game after launch as the key attractions in driving player spending.
