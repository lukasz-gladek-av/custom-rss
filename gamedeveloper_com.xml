It's a question the industry is grappling with from top to bottom, with the largest studios attempting to craft billion-dollar series capable of crossing the transmedia divide and smaller devs perhaps hoping to turn their indie darlings into household names.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UK developer Hollow Ponds, the outfit behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, might have found an answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio, along with a team of frequent collaborators, has crafted a burgeoning franchise around an unlikely figure. Enter Wilmot, the beaming warehouse manager and star of organizational puzzler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Five years after the title debuted, Wilmot has swapped the stock-taking for jigsaw-making in laid back sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. At around the same time, Hollow Ponds also unveiled the Wilmot's Warehouse board game–a cooperative rollick developed with help from&nbsp;design studio and publisher CMYK and board game-focused outlet Shut Up &amp; Sit Down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how they transformed Wilmot from blue collar worker into an unassuming leading man, Hollow Ponds founder and creative director Ricky Haggett explains the studio initially benefited from a series of rather happy accidents–but a propensity for pragmatism also paid off. "We weren't like 'we're going to go big on Wilmot,'" explains Haggett, noting the board game and the video game sequel were "two completely different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although they eventually launched at a similar time, the board game actually coalesced during the pandemic. Before lockdown, Haggett would host regular board game hangouts with a few friends, including game designer, researcher, and lecturer David King. King has made a bunch of board games and would often bring concepts to those soirees–including a very roughshod morsel inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King unveiled that particular concept during the very last meeting the group held before COVID-19 (and lockdowns) took hold. Yet, despite being in the primordial stages of development, Haggett was able to refine the idea, which riffs on the concept of the video game without replicating it directly, throughout the pandemic by continuing to host virtual game nights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started figuring out what be a good size of grid. We started figuring out what a good cadence adding objects [would be]," he says. "For a while, we had things being added and taken away constantly. We had lots and lots of cards, which did lots of weird spatial things to the warehouse. We made lots of changes, and we just gradually whittled it down in a very unpressured way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and freedom. Two things most game developers crave, but can very rarely count on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that by constantly tweaking the project during the pandemic, he was able to reach a point where it was 80 percent done by the time he approached CMYK. Shut Up &amp; Sit Down production and marketing manager Matt Lees also provided valuable feedback that "fixed the last weird problem" plaguing the project–which largely revolved around how to end the game by way of a frantic card-matching (or order fulfilment) phase. "The whole experience of designing that game was ego free," says Haggett. "People from all directions were suggesting things and having an open chat. [...] None of it generally felt stressful. It's actually a lovely antitheses to trying to fix all the bugs in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHa17b9fJAE?si=hSn7uEE_pFeS9TGk" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, where is the overlap between Wilmot's exploits in the digital and physical realms? Well, it's difficult to untangle. Haggett says Hollow Ponds has noticed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sales spikes that could be linked to the launch of the board game–although with the sequel also hitting shelves at a similar time, it's hard to separate the two. It has, however, visibly expanded the Wilmot footprint–a soaring achievement given the character's lack of feet. "We've definitely see people talk about the video game on board game-centric places saying 'hey, this is a video game as well,' and we've definitely seen people who just like the video game buying the board game, even though they're not necessarily board game people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's cross-pollination, then, but what about the financial aspect? Haggett says Hollow Ponds hasn't quite made its money back on first quarter sales of the board game, but that it isn't far off. He notes that second quarter sales will include the holidays and retailers who've just ordered units, and feels the board game will be akin to a snowball gathering momentum. As we've already mentioned, it also landed at a fortuitous time, placing more eyes on Wilmot as Hollow Ponds prepared to debut a sequel in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett tells us that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still pulling in thousands of pounds each quarter, but massively surpassed expectations when it launched in 2019 thanks in part to an Xbox Game Pass deal the studio secured. The company then received cash from Sony to deliver a PlayStation port. Haggett acknowledges those deals, however, are by no means guaranteed and advises caution when working on titles of that scale. "I think if you were making a Wilmot-sized game I would be scared of spending more than around £200,000," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was bigger but still in the "low hundreds of thousands of pounds." Hollow Ponds also secured financing from the UK Games Fund (£25,000) that allowed them to hire a programmer to create a prototype, which according to Haggett was "pretty much what the game ended up being." It helped that Haggett was able to kickstart the project by taking the source code from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and stripping out all of the warehouse jiggery-pokery to create a "little jigsaw prototype." Meanwhile, Wilmot co-creator Richard Hogg set about creating the artwork that would become the myriad of jigsaws featured in-game, taking on a huge amount of work in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett estimates production took around 12 months in total, although that time was spread across years due to the need to support other projects. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched on Steam on October 23, 2024, for £12.79 (a similar price point to the first game) and sold twice as well as its predecessor during its first month on shelves. It marks the second title the studio has released in 2024 after multiplayer adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a much larger and more complex undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hasn't sold "incredibly well" but again highlights that Hollow Ponds was able to sign an Xbox Game Pass deal, presumably mitigating some financial risk. He remains "very happy" with the game itself, and notes the reception and feedback from players has been "great." Still, cashflow is important–and therein lies the balancing act.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Making big things is useful," says Haggett, explaining how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled the company to secure larger amounts of funding and work with influential publishers such as Annapurna Interactive. "But you can't guarantee you're going to be able to find publishers to fund your video games, and if you can't do that then it's helpful if you have smaller projects to fill in the cash flow at times," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, we're not a studio that has all of our employees working on a game. We don't really have many employees at all–we're a husband and wife team with one producer as a full-time employee. So when we finished </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we didn't have 20 people to support between projects. If we did we'd be screwed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nonetheless, there are gaps between [projects]. Even in the best case scenario there are naturally gaps. And its nice to be able to fill those with the smaller projects that bring in money that bumps the cashflow. Every little thing you have out there in the world is a little revenue stream, and it's a lot easier to get lots of little trickles of revenue from smaller, low-risk projects than massive mega projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era when phrases like 'survive to 2025' have (perhaps rather naively) been tossed around, perhaps there's something to be said for tempering blockbuster ambitions and championing reliable stalwarts like Wilmot.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The Headlines that matter">Status Report: The Headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-taken-down-by-collectible-maker-funko-and-ai-tool-brand-shield">Report: Itch.io taken down by collectible maker Funko and AI tool Brand Shield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Indie game marketplace itch.io was briefly taken down last weekend and co-founder Leaf Corcoran said the culprit was none other than collectible maker Funko. He claimed Funko is leveraging AI-powered brand protection technology called Brand Shield that sent a "bogus phishing report" to itch's registrar, which proceeded to disable the domain. The storefront was eventually restored, but the ordeal looks to have kickstarted a feud between Corcoran and the Funko Pop! maker. This might become the most bizarre beef in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-publishing-signs-content-partnership-with-openai">Future Publishing signs content partnership with OpenAI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // UK media company Future Publishing has signed a deal with OpenAI that will enable the ChatGPT maker to access content from its 200-plus brands. Those brands include game industry publications such as Edge, GamesRadar, and PC Games, and the response from a number of journalists who've worked for the company indicated the deal has gone down like a lead balloon coated in cement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/ubisoft-kills-xdefiant-and-closes-studios-in-san-franciso-and-osaka">Ubisoft kills XDefiant and closes studios in San Francisco and Osaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Ubisoft wasn't the only company to make layoffs over the past couple of weeks, but it was particularly notable to see another major studio carve through internal teams after trying and failing to launch a live service shooter. XDefiant only debuted in May but is now being tossed on the scrapheap. Ubisoft said 277 people will "likely" be laid off as a result. Don't worry, though, because the French publisher also confirmed the games-as-as-service model will remain "central" to its business strategy moving forward. What a relief.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader">Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/google-latest-ai-innovation-offers-a-putrid-vision-of-game-development">Opinion: Google's latest AI innovation offers a putrid vision of game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">// Google recently unveiled a new AI-powered world model called Genie 2 that was being paraded around as a tool with the potential to change video game development forever.
