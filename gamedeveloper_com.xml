Some slots are reserved for the "biggest surprises," and organizer Geoff Keighley curates "free slots for what he personally wants to champion." But aside from these exceptions, developers who want to get their games in front of millions of viewers (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/game-awards-2024-viewership-record-1236253334/">154 million in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, according to The Game Awards) have to pay the aforementioned fees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> report on Summer Game Fest, an annual showcase that's also organized by Keighley, provided a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">first insight</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into how much trailers can cost. Back then, prices reportedly ranged from $250,000 for a one-minute trailer, $350,000 for 90 seconds, to $550,00 for two and a half minutes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An Esquire source acknowledged those costs may be too much for smaller studios, calling the price structure "an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/bekah-saltsman-breaks-down-indie-biz-essentials-gdc-side-quest" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bekah Saltsman breaks down indie marketing essentials - GDC Side Quest</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 2023 Game Awards had a similar pricing structure but, as noted by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> some major publishers get "earned editorial placements" during the main show at no cost.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nominated studios are reportedly offered only two tickets to attend the ceremony">Nominated studios are reportedly offered only two tickets to attend the ceremony</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to multiple developers speaking to Kotaku, from "both smaller indie studios and triple-A monoliths" who wished to remain anonymous, the Game Awards reportedly offers only two tickets to attend the ceremony to studios that get nominated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The report notes there was at least one instance in which a developer received more than that, and some overall confusion about which studios get preferential treatment (as in, more than two tickets).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A source told Kotaku that Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind this year’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, bought a "swath of tickets at face value" (around $300 each) to ensure more members of the team could attend. The game received 12 nominations, setting a record for most nominations in Game Awards history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year expressed frustration to Kotaku about the ticketing process of the event. Since they're no longer under contract with the nominated studio, they didn't qualify for an official invite.

"At the very least, TGA should wait to sell general release tickets until after the nominations are announced…or have a separate bucket of tickets for devs who can provide proof that they worked on a nominated game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lead-up to this year's Game Awards hasn't been without complications.

After two years in a row without the organization announcing a new cohort of industry professionals, Future Class organizer Emily Weir confirmed to Game Developer that the Game Awards isn't planning a new Future Class for this year, nor does the organization have "any active programming plans for Future Class."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/book-excerpt-online-community" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: Mastering Community Management: Chaos, Compassion, and Connections in Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards has also removed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thegameawards.com/future-class">the Future Class page on its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, eliminating the definitive record of previous honorees.
