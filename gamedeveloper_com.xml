They're ex-triple A, bootstrapping their dream game, getting lots of verbal praise from potential funding partners but no hard cash. The team decided to turn to Kickstarter before their 2024 studio debut, but after the announcement went wide (and they scored a cool 200,000 wishlists on Steam in the process), they realized Kickstarter might not just be a last-ditch effort to find funding—it could be the best way possible to bring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to life.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-indie-nearstudios-founded-by-ex-bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-devs" target="_self" data-discover="true">New indie, NEARstudios founded by ex Bethesda, Bioware and Naughty Dog devs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hawthorn"><span>Hawthorn</span> hits with players, but not with funders</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cerlan and Richardson had different paths to the game that became </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson's been stewing on the idea of a "cozy" co-op game for some time. In his days at Funcom he'd search for games that he could play with his wife, his kids, and his friends, but nothing hit all three groups. Iron Gate Studios' survival crafting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valheim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a close match, but it wasn't quite what he was looking for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson's spent years in the world of multiplayer game design, and began noodling on a woodland creature co-op game that would fit his family. Elsewhere, Cerlan was dreaming about striking out on her own with a new game studio making games that bring people together, and as she and Richardson compared notes, they realized they were on the same wavelength.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players create characters based on several woodland animals, each with different affinities and weaknesses (owls can easily fly, otters take to the water, mice to the fields, etc). The diversified roles let people with different playstyles play together, and the woodland-themed vibe (inspired by the likes of Redwall, Watership Down, Beatrix Potter, etc.) is meant to stand out from the rest of the survival genre, which tends to tack toward </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite-</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">adjacent cartoon characters, pixel art aesthetics, or hardcore grittiness inspired by the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rust</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>Image via NEARstudios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NEARstudios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair spoke about how "nostalgia" was a key theme for the team, but it definitely seems to be nostalgia with an edge. To a woodland creature, corn stalks are as tall as trees, rivers can be as big as lakes, and predators the size of titanic beasts—building a home in the forest can feel like carving a safe haven against the pounding rain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a vibrant pitch—one that hits with players (Cerlan described pitching her game to prospective fans at TwitchCon and MAGFest, and feeling relieved when their faces lit up at the premise—but never that quite clicked with investors. The gap in enthusiasm was confusing, to say the least. Maybe it's because their team of ex-triple A workers is assembled from rank-and-file devs, not studio or creative leads?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe, said Cerlan. "We were the people on the ground floor, the cogs in the wheel," she said. "I don't know how much that played a factor in us trying to get funding, but on the flip side that was really, really good because we had a team of folks that could get in the editor and do the work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because they could all "do the work," Richardson said they kicked open the door with a more robust gameplay preview than he's seen from other venture-backed studios. "I've heard stories from other startups that had money, or had vision, or had executives, but just didn't have gameplay," he said. Those studios struggled to find the "soul" of their game—but as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s debut showed, NEARstudios seems to have found something that clicks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The nitty gritty of pivoting to Kickstarter">The nitty gritty of pivoting to Kickstarter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't just take the 200k wishlist stat as a sign of life for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Cerlan recalled the day the video went wide, waiting for the embargo to break—and a feeling of anxiety as few outlets picked the story up (sorry guys, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-indie-nearstudios-founded-by-ex-bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-devs">we needed a few hours</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). But stories did drop throughout the day, and shortly after, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@madmorph/video/7424205573320625440">videos from content creators followed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scan the comments of videos about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you'll find frothing enthusiasm for the game's similarities to Brian Jacques' Redwall book series (and yet not a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Eulalia">Eulalia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">!" in sight...). Here, Cerlan had to fess up: she hasn't read Redwall, though it's an inspiration for other NEARstudios employees like Richardson and community manager Daniel Warren.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But hard work always comes after days of heady player praise, and for NEARStudios, that work came in the form of expanding what will go into their Kickstarter. First, they had to field surprise interest from publishers. Now that they'd landed wishlists and a few thousand views across TikTok, YouTube, and beyond, maybe they were a more appealing catch than before?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Possibly—but the pitches they received didn't reflect it. Richardson and Cerlan expressed frustration that the publishers who'd reached out offered what seemed to be very unfavorable terms. Certainly nothing that offered more stability than Kickstarter would.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expanding a Kickstarter's scope isn't just about updating pitch documents and stretch goals. Marketing plans need ironing out, budget tiers have to be set, and maybe most importantly, the cost of backer awards needs to be assessed. Several Kickstarter creators have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/kickstarter-physical-backer-rewards-can-add-complications">pointed out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the amount of revenue you pull in from a campaign isn't just slashed by taxes and the platform cut, it's neutered by how much you spend on backer rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cerlan said the studio's still working on those challenges, but they came armed with key advantages. First, they've spent the entirety of development not just building content but assessing what kind of game they can produce at different budgets. As experts like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-finji-ceo-bekah-saltsman-would-update-about-her-gdc-talk-on-indie-pitching">Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have explained, it's best for devs seeking funding to plan out what they can accomplish at different budget tiers. "We have a $6 million budget, we have a $3 million budget, and we have a $1.5 million budget," Cerlan explained. It's a jumping off point for establishing what the team can accomplish if it hits the campaign's base goal—and then what's physically possible with the ascending stretch goals.</span></p><p>Image via NEARstudios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NEARstudios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of backer rewards—the pair admitted they needed expert help here. One NEARstudios employee is a former senior finance manager at Zenimax (the Microsoft-owned parent company of Bethesda Softworks, where Cerlan and Richardson were both previously employed). "That's our biggest concern, being able to deliver what we say we're going to be able to deliver," said Cerlan. "You're really putting almost your entire roadmap out for the public to see, and that's terrifying because development is hard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then there's one final twist with going to Kickstarter. The upside of Kickstarter is that your players can fund development directly in exchange for pre-ordering the game (and maybe picking up a few goodies for an extra purchase). For a multiplayer game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it also helps to have an excited batch of players ready to leap in and build a landing pad for newcomers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem is when your game launches, you already have their money, and not many will plan to double dip—so your launch sales have to attract a healthy amount of new players, or you've essentially cashed in your chips early. "Our hope is that this game is broadly appealing enough that like, Kickstarter is just going to be like a drop in the bucket," said Cerlan. If the Kickstarter is successful, NEARstudios will have enough funding to bring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to Early Access. If </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can get to Early Access, the team can market it through Steam festivals and attract more player attention through demos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If that seems like a lot to pull off between the initial announcement and the Kickstarter debut—it is. Cerlan acknowledged that after NEARstudios' big public debut, they chose to seek out more friends and family investments to build out their runway. The adage is unfortunately true: to make money, you have to spend money.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does a resurgence of Kickstarter mean for the game development community?">What does a resurgence of Kickstarter mean for the game development community?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are probably dozens—if not hundreds—of small teams like NEARstudios in the same rickety boat. They set out to make their dream game right when investment funding dried up. They pitched, and pitched, and pitched, but got nothing or worse than nothing back from partners. And now with time running out, they're looking at funding opportunities that let them speak directly to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a hell of a gamble—but sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Dkc0RZ8Ym1Y?si=SnqeXdMxPrPf_uMy">you have to roll the hard six</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NEARstudios' journey also invites the industry to think about what it means that Kickstarter and other platforms help developers raise funding that "they wouldn't get from publishers or investors." In 2012, that statement was a question of logistics as much as it was company strategy or taste. In 2025 it has a more glaring meaning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">]It makes me think of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/blockchain-tech-not-the-metaverse-was-the-talk-of-this-year-s-dice">an exchange I witnessed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> between an investor and an indie game dev at a DICE Mixer in 2022. "I'm looking for funding," the indie dev explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Are you making any blockchain games?" the investor replied. I wouldn't even say he was being cynical—he was soliciting a sincere pitch. Yet for all his cheerfulness, a dour mood fell on the group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this year's DICE conference I happened to pass that same investor taking a meeting at the Aria Starbucks. The developer he'd spoken with three years prior was also at the event, still searching for funding. Would that conversation look different now? Was this investor's portfolio more diversified, with a number of small-to-medium sized investments sitting alongside the AI slush?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe—or maybe not, if all the conversations I had with a number of talented devs were anything to go by. So many had stories like NEARstudios'. Pitch after pitch after pitch, only to receive mild praise or underbaked offers in return. There's sturm and drang about needing to make "safe bets" but it's funny how "safe bets" still look like millions of dollars poured into the same kinds of companies they spent the last half-decade swinging and missing with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson and Cerlan aren't former Zenimax executives or fabled creative directors. They're people who make games. And they and others like them are turning to Kickstarter not just out of a sense they can speak directly to players, but because they've been turned away by those with the keys to the cash vaults. If the Kickstarter boom pays off—if they, Frogwares, Playable Worlds, and other studios find success on the platform—it should be seen as a mark of shame on the financing world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really such a huge risk? A few million dollars to deliver a woodland creature fantasy that's been the backbone of literature for centuries? Does our industry really believe great games can only come from people who held senior roles at financially successful juggernauts? When I check in with teams like NEARstudios, I worry they're fighting to survive in an industry isn't just bored of creativity, but downright hostile to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "soul" of Hawthorn, as Richardson put it, is that it's a game about small creatures with different specialties banding together to not just take down beasts, but to support one another and build a thriving community in a hostile world. May we all root for the mice, the otters, the owls, and the snakes trying to survive and thrive in these stormy times.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
