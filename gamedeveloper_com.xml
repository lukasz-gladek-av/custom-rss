The market is expected to decline further in 2025, in line with Omdia’s earlier projections. The outlook reflects a challenging period for the consumer VR industry ahead of a forecasted rebound in 2026. In this blog I lay out key drivers behind the downturn in 2024, as well as the factors driving the assumed growth in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing">VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The consumer VR market continues to face significant challenges, with several indicators highlighting a lack of momentum and adoption. The highly anticipated Apple Vision Pro debut has failed to deliver the resurgence the industry hoped for, with limited developer enthusiasm and fading momentum ten months post-launch. Meanwhile, Meta’s recent entry-level Quest 3S has yet to spark a notable sales boost, as evidenced by my analysis of Black Friday headset sales across eight countries, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/giokinto.bsky.social/post/3lcnkdzfdhs2p">which shows a 16% decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. PC VR adoption also remains stagnant, with Valve’s latest Hardware Survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgejijiashvili_vr-pcvr-vr-activity-7265701366692487168-Nb7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">only 1.5% of Steam users are engaging with VR</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hardware. Adding to this, Omdia’s supply chain insights confirm earlier reports of Sony </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/sony-hits-pause-on-psvr2-production-as-unsold-inventory-piles-up">halting PlayStation VR2 production</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> due to unsold inventory, prompting the company to resort to heavy discounting to clear stock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges are further exacerbated in other markets and segments. VR headset sales in China have collapsed due to weak consumer demand, and the future of Pico remains uncertain following layoffs and restructuring by its parent company, ByteDance. The TikTok owner, which acquired Pico in 2021, appears to be losing interest in the segment. On the content side, developers are increasingly questioning the return on investment for VR games, with a recent Game Developer Collective survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-says-half-of-developers-consider-vr-market-on-decline-or-stagnation">half of respondents perceive the VR market as either stagnant or in decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of VR headsets in active use fell by 8% in 2024 to 21.9 million. This was primarily due to a low share of Quest 2 owners upgrading, over 20 million of which have been sold since 2020. Meanwhile, $904 million was spent on VR content in 2024; for context, games console content spend will generate $37.4 billion in 2024, highlighting the nascent nature of the consumer VR market. The current state of the VR market is characterized by waning consumer interest post-pandemic, a sluggish inflow of compelling new content, and growing skepticism among developers about the viability of VR as a profitable platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely">Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expected return to growth in the VR market is heavily reliant on the anticipated launch of a more affordable Apple Vision Pro model in 2026, which is projected to drive the market expansion through 2029. Meta is also expected to remain a key player in the space, though its headset sales are likely to remain flat. Meta’s recent move to open its Horizon OS to third-party manufacturers underscores its continued commitment to VR, but the company faces an uphill battle. Meanwhile, Google’s announcement of the Android XR platform last week represents a much-needed competition in this space, but its history of launching and shortly shuttering new projects tempers expectations. Developer and manufacturer approach to these initiatives will be cautious, therefore, only incremental progress is anticipated in the short-term.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The form factor of current VR and passthrough mixed reality headsets remains a barrier to mass adoption. Consumer and manufacturer interest is shifting toward lightweight glasses, promising all-day, anywhere access to multimodal AI – as exemplified by Meta Ray-Ban glasses, which is seeing early signs of success. Companies in this space hope that this approach will help normalize face-based spatial computing, which could ultimately spur mass-market VR adoption. However, the progress towards achieving this will be slow, and isn’t expected to happen within this decade. In the near term, VR is likely to remain a niche market, constrained by its existing limitations and the growing industry focus on AR as the future of immersive technology.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

It's unclear how many people the studio employed at the time of its closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Vancouver-based studio was established in 2006 by former Radical Entertainment staffers Steve Bocska, James Ceraldi and Joel DeYoung. Initially, Hothead focused on developing and publishing digital console and PC titles, but eventually pivoted to focus on creating free-to-play mobile games (with mixed results).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We threw all kinds of small, inexpensive games at the wall to see what stuck.&nbsp; Surprise surprise, surprise nothing stuck," wrote Wilkinson, looking back on that period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, we went back to our roots and created sports games under the Big Win brand and shooting games under the Rivals at War (RAW) brand and eventually the Kill Shot brand.&nbsp;These series of games were very successful–we finally discovered lightning in a bottle.&nbsp;Those were the most successful years for Hothead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past year, Hothead had been working on a playable prototype for a triple-A project. Wilkinson said the studio hoped to secure contracts with different publishers so it could develop mobile, PC, and console versions of the game, but explained that process took longer than expected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unfortunately, it took far longer than we expected to secure contracts for these versions of the game," he said. "They were both ready to close two weeks ago and then the mobile publisher pulled out due to a change in strategy. Two weeks later the console publisher also pulled out.&nbsp;At that point our only remaining option was bankruptcy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back on Hothead's legacy, Wilkinson said it wasn't the games that made the studio-but rather its people. "Hothead was chock full of incredibly, smart, talented, loyal, hardworking but mostly just really nice people.&nbsp;People that had your back at work and outside of work.&nbsp;Many of us made lifelong friends at Hothead," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We grew up together, we laughed, we cried, we celebrated, we grieved, we found partners, we started families. I had the privilege of working with so many wonderful people at Hothead over the years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Hopefully, this won’t be the last time you hear from us. We still believe we are destined to work together again and continue to do great things.&nbsp;But even if that doesn’t happen, I am a better person for working at Hothead and I consider myself blessed to have spent 16 years shoulder to shoulder with my fellow Hotheads."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
