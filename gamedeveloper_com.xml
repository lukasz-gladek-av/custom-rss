According to him, the move from yearly Chapters is easier on the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar live-service games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have comparable three-month seasons. ZeniMax Online will gradually move toward making "smaller bite-sized content," in addition to "some larger items" that will release throughout the year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We'll be able to have teams launch content when it is ready throughout the year and not work to a date in June—this will let us focus on a greater variety of content spread over the year," he said. "This supports the new Seasons model, and will enable us to release content, updates, fixes, and systems in a more efficient manner."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Live-service is getting a refresh">Live-service is getting a refresh</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this year, Bungie outlined a series of changes to its own content model for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Codename: Behemoth will then follow Apollo with updates in winter 2025 and spring 2026. There will also be two free, individual seasons per update.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Firor, ZeniMax is looking at doing quest content in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elder Scrolls Online </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in "different ways" with its upcoming model. Some of the plans he outlined included using existing zones and areas to tell new stories (or continue already existing ones), split large zones across multiple updates, and provide the team with "the space to find a new cadence that can mix new content and systems with addressing feedback, fixing issues, and adding new quests and activities to existing zones and stories."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Firor's full outlook on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elder Scrolls Online </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and what's to come can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
