The lawsuit was filed in California on behalf of an underage plaintiff referred to as as 'Jane Doe', and takes aim at both platforms for allegedly enabling an accused sexual predator to harass and exploit Doe during interactions on each.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It notably concerns not only how Discord and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s system allegedly allowed for this interaction to take place, but also explores the action the two companies could've take to prevent situations like the one at the center of this lawsuit from happening. Additionally, the suit challenges the two companies' messaging on user safety, implying they knowingly make promises they can't keep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This case, filed on April 21, 2025, accuses the two companies of "facilitating the sexual exploitation" of the plaintiff as the direct result of lax safety standards and misrepresentation of safety protocols to parents. It follows years of investigations about the risks of child sexual abuse on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and details how the failings reported in those investigations may have contributed to the harm of the minor.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/journey-and-sky-dev-thatgamecompany-announces-game-jam-with-10-000-in-prizes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Journey developer thatgamecompany to co-host game jam with $10,000 prize pool</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/parents-sue-i-roblox-i-for-allegedly-hosting-child-grooming-sexual-content">Roblox has faced lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over child safety in the past, but this appears to be the first lawsuit that levies accusations on both Roblox and Discord. According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents became aware she was being sexually exploited by an individual described in the lawsuit as a "known predator" through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord in 2022. That individual allegedly targeted her through two games within the wider </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mic Up</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Write A Letter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and was able to send her messages through the "whisper" function even though her Roblox account "clearly displayed" she was a minor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In time, the plaintiff was convinced to share her Discord username with the accused predator, leading to conversations on the popular chat platform where she was then coerced into sending sexually explicit images. These events took place over the course of six months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents were aware of the safety tools and resources intended to keep minors safe on Roblox but allege that the materials fall short. The lawsuit accuses both companies of failing to implement strong safety procedures and, beyond that, of misrepresenting the safety of their platforms to parents in order to maximize revenue, specifically describing how the plaintiff's father reviewed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Parent's Guide before letting her use the platform and allowing her to play online. Following the incident and after her father blocked her from accessing Discord and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the plaintiff reportedly attempted suicide.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/io-interactive-co-founder-launches-new-studio-unveils-first-project-for-summer-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">IO Interactive co-founder launches new 'consensus'-driven studio</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Are ">Are <span>Roblox</span> and Discord as safe as they claim?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit filed against Roblox</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Discord dedicates several pages to the claims both companies have previously made about safety on each of their platforms, going as far as to call out executives like Roblox Corporation CEO David Baszucki by name for statements made to the press. Roblox</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">vice president of civility &amp; partnerships Tami Bhaumik is likewise singled out for comments made in 2024 to Parents Magazine that state the company has "a responsibility to make sure players can learn, create, and play safely. This continues to be our most important priority and that will never change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comments from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman are spotlighted as well, with Kaufman previously telling NPR that "any time anything happens to a child that puts them at risk is one [time] too many." The lawsuit positions these statements alongside contrasting documented allegations of sexually abusive activity that have allegedly taken place on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">including a recent report by Hindenberg Research</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> scrutinizing a number of games on the platform that mimicked the alleged sexual abuse of music mogul P. Diddy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-meta-has-laid-off-over-100-reality-labs-employees" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Meta has laid off over 100 Reality Labs employees</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Former Discord CEO Jason Zitron (erroneously identified as Eric Citron in the suit) is cited within the filing as telling U.S. Congress in 2024 that Discord "has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual conduct with children, meaning inappropriate sexual contact between adults and teens on the service, with special attention given to predatory behaviors such as online enticement and the sexual extortion of children, commonly referred to as 'sextortion.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These comments within the lawsuit are again paired against documentation of Discord content that goes against those stated policies, such as graphic imagery that includes documented child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The company is criticized for making several of its default safety features "opt-in" instead of "opt-out", with the suit also arguing that embedded Discord features on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> platform further facilitates abuse across both platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit suggests that both companies could improve safety by improving age verification to prevent underage users from creating accounts without their parents' permission and requiring users to provide real names when registering for an account. Discord is specifically criticized for not allowing family-connected account admins to have access to the contents of messages for children's accounts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combined, the criticisms against </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord are pertinent to the personal experience described by the plaintiff, who is now asking for a jury to weigh in on the years-long contention that popular online platforms are not doing enough to protect children. The outcome could decide the fate of both companies, and have implications for other companies making online games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Roblox Corporation and Discord for comment and will update this story when a response is issued.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
