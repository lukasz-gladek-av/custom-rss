For starters, new users who sign up to the site will use Epic Games accounts. Epic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/sketchfab-is-now-part-of-epic-games">acquired the store</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in July 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More notably, Sketchfab is also rolling out a mandate for gen AI assets. Previously, the store only required the "CreatedWithAI" label on models that were made available for sale or download. Now, this requirement applies to every AI-generated model, regardless of whether people can download it or not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This helps maintain transparency across the community and makes it easier to discover the type of content you're most interested in," reads the announcement. "New search filters— which rely upon accurate labeling of models as 'CreatedWithAI'—will enable you to find or exclude AI-generated content."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Sketchfab said that, in some cases, if the site detects models have been created with gen AI, it "may" assign the label to those models.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Epic Games continues to be open to generative AI">Epic Games continues to be open to generative AI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we near closer to the end of 2025, game developers are still </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai">not warming up to generative AI,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and some of them are being more worried than ever that the technology </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">will lower the quality of games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/digiphile-is-a-new-charitable-storefront-from-a-group-of-humble-bundle-veterans" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digiphile is a new charitable discovery platform from a group of Humble Bundle veterans</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That being said, Epic Games has remained open to using gen AI.
