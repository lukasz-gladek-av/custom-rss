It's a notable move for the entertainment industry that will make Netflix the owner of major film and television franchises such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, White Lotus, The Sopranos, and the wider DC Universe.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, a Warner Bros.

"Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities.

The streamer said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations while building on the company's strengths, including theatrical movie releases. At the same time, it outlined plans to realize at least $2 billion to $3 billion of cost savings per year over the course of three years.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.

Two titanic storefronts that control access to a huge portion of the PC market have blacklisted a title seemingly without rhyme or reason.
