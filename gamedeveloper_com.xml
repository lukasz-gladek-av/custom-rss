To provide some clarity, I reached out to Kuits specialist employment solicitor, Jake McManus, who has broken the mechanism down for our readers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Interim relief is rarely sought and even more rarely granted, primarily because it is only available in very limited circumstances, including where an employee alleges to be dismissed due to trade union activity or for whistleblowing," McManus told Game Developer.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not available to employees who are otherwise dismissed unfairly or in discrimination cases, both of which make up the vast majority of claims brought in the Employment Tribunal. Put simply, the circumstances in which an application for interim relief may be available just do not occur very often. Applications for interim relief must also be made within 7 days of the dismissal, so many employees will be out of time before they even consider whether an application can or should be made."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;An unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself&quot;">"An unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself"</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-is-evaluating-how-its-game-tech-may-be-applied-to-physical-ai-and-robotics-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton is evaluating how its game tech may be applied to 'physical AI and robotics'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that interim relief can only be sought in select circumstances, including instances of alleged union busting, explains why the fired Rockstar workers were able to seek it out. Why, though, is the bar for success during an interim relief hearing higher than the bar for a positive outcome at a full hearing?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply put: a positive outcome for employees seeking interim relief could be incredibly costly for employers, especially in a climate where a backlog of tribunals means some cases could take years to reach a resolution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If successful, a dismissed employee can be reinstated or remain on full pay until their unfair dismissal claim is dealt with. Given the current backlog in the Tribunal system we could be talking years: an unfair dismissal claim issued today is unlikely to reach a final hearing until 2027 or 2028," added McManus.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is therefore a very powerful weapon in an employee's armoury and can be very costly for an employer. What is more, if the employee goes on to lose their unfair dismissal claim then there is no obligation to reimburse the employer for any pay. Interim relief is ultimately a draconian measure for Tribunals to deploy and that is why it is rarely granted."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-sony-nintendo-provide-joint-update-on-player-safety-commitment" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo provide joint update on player safety commitment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing that threshold for success, McManus noted that interim relief will only be granted when a tribunal feels a claimant is "likely" to demonstrate the principal reason for their dismissal is one of the "very limited circumstances" detailed above—i.e. union busting or whistleblowing. That means employees must establish they have a "pretty good chance of success" when seeking interim relief as opposed to simply a "reasonable prospect of success."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, McManus explained an unsuccessful interim relief application does not mean an unfair dismissal claim is doomed to fail—though it would certainly improve its chances of success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the employee is successful with their application for interim relief then it is likely that they will be successful with the claim itself," he added. "It also signals to the parties that the claimants have a strong case, and given that the employer is affected financially by the decision to grant interim relief, it can encourage settlement. However, an unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of the interim relief tribunal between the ousted Rockstar workers and their former employer, McManus said the judge overseeing proceedings was simply unconvinced at this stage that Rockstar's decision to dismiss those employees was "most likely" due to trade union activity. As we have already established, though, a positive outcome for employees at this point in the process is rare, and McManus said the ruling doesn't mean the judge believed the dismissals were fair or that fair process was followed.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
