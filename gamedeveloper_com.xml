He added that "having met Rockstar, they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union-busting."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, in a question for the UK Prime Minister, Murray asked if he agrees that all companies, regardless of profit size, must follow "UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starmer proceeded to respond by calling it a "deeply concerning" case, and that every worker has the right to join a trade union.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said. "Our ministers will look into the particular case that he raises and keep him updated."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an statement given to IWGB, Murray added that his meeting with Rockstar "only entrenched" his concerns about the process the company used to "dismiss so many of their staff members." Moreover, he wasn't "assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law," nor convinced him that "this course of action was necessary."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/call-of-duty-ditches-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops" target="_self" data-discover="true">Call of Duty ditches back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare and Black Ops</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal," Murray said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Over 200 Rockstar staffers asked for the employees to be reinstated">Over 200 Rockstar staffers asked for the employees to be reinstated</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The IWGB has referred to the dismissal of the employees as a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-firing-over-30-union-members-in-calculated-attack-on-workers-">calculated attack on workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," accusing Rockstar of illegally firing members of its UK team for engaging in trade union activity.

Moreover, the statement emphasized that the firing was "in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/major-shareholder-blames-square-enix-for-sluggish-revenue-and-profit-margins" target="_self" data-discover="true">Major shareholder denounces Square Enix for 'sluggish' revenue and profit margins</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IWGB said that Rockstar is attempting to "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-deflecting-after-claiming-fired-union-workers-leaked-information">deflect</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" from the truth and remains afraid of "hard working staff privately discussing and exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, on November 12, IWGB issued formal legal claims against Rockstar for its actions, bringing the dispute before the British courts.
