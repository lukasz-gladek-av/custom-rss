According to a number of former employees, Benzies and other senior employees doomed the game's development through a combination of "knee-jerk" decisions and a refusal to listen to employee concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This narrative differs from Benzies' own reported explanation for the game's commercial failure (it peaked at 3,000 players on its week of launch, a low number for a game from such a large company). In a virtual town hall reviewed by the BBC, Benzies told employees in an all-hands call that "internal and external forces" and a number of "saboteurs" conspired to undermine Build A Rocket Boy from the inside out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I find it disgusting that anyone could sit amongst us, behave like this and continue to work here," he reportedly told workers. But former employees told the BBC that Benzies was his own inner saboteur. The CEO apparently ordered radical changes in development on both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mindseye</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and user generated content (UGC) platform </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everywhere. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">One such major change was the decision to launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mindseye </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as a standalone game and not an in-app "experience," as the studio teased in its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/GBk-LY0iWmE?si=xi5gszWgF3an94Fh">public reveal at Gamescom 2022</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-about-global-success-gamescom-asia-x-thailand-game-show-director-outlines-vision-for-new-look-event" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's about global success:' Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show director outlines vision for new-look event</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Former staffers like associate producer Margherita "Marg" Peloso and lead data analyst Ben Newbon said Benzies micromanaged development through what became known as "Leslie tickets." Benzies would reportedly demand changes following lengthy playtests of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mindseye</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These might be as minor as cosmetic issues or as large as removing entire missions from the game. Newbon and other staffers told the BBC this process can be seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-ztKumy2bpk">a promotional video</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> released four days before game's debut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Newbon and Peloso also described being laughed at or outright ignored when they raised major problems with other members of leadership. This all allegedly occurred in a roughly four-month sprint of crunch where developers reported suffering physical and mental ailments due to the stress, as well as "regressions," where one team would successfully fix a bug only for another team to accidentally revive it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more insights from former Build A Rocket Boy employees, be sure to read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo">their full accounts on BBC Newswire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer has reached out to Build A Rocket Boy and will update this story when the company responds.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
