Since last week, Cleveland and Krafton have been taking shots at one another in statements to the public, with the founder and his peers now filing a lawsuit against the company that bought their studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The escalation began on July 10, 2025 with a statement from Krafton addressed to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community where the company accused Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill of "abandoning the responsibilities" involved with developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game dame director and technical director...but both declined to do so," the company wrote. It then described the financial performance of Unknown Worlds' tabletop-inspired multiplayer game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Moonbreaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a "failure," and accused Cleveland of focusing on a "personal film project" instead (Cleveland did post 7 months ago on Reddit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePodcasts/comments/1harojd/opening_up_movie_making_a_christmas_letter/">about making a film called A Christmas Letter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This statement followed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-subnautica-2-is-delayed-potentially-costing-devs-a-250m-bonus-payout">a report from Bloomberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on July 9 that Krafton had delayed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to 2025 to avoid a $250 million payout to Unknown Worlds. The payout would have been tied to the studio hitting key revenue goals by the end of 2025, goals it would likely miss if </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were delayed to 2026.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/exploring-sabotage-studio-s-strategy-for-balancing-creativity-and-sustainability-game-developer-podcast-ep-50" target="_self" data-discover="true">Exploring Sabotage Studio's strategy for balancing creativity and sustainability - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 50</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule," it continued. "The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hours later, Cleveland took to Reddit to announce he and his peers are suing Krafton. Bloomberg games reporter Jason Schreier has stated that the lawsuit being filed for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltpa5br36k2o">breach of contract,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but the complaint is currently under seal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The details should eventually become (at least mostly) public," wrote the Unknown Worlds co-founder. "You all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Was ">Was <span>Subnautica 2</span> ready to release in Early Access?</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-13-trump-s-video-game-funding-cuts-laid-bare-and-krafton-reportedly-screws-over-the-subnautica-2-dev-team" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #13: Trump's video game funding cuts laid bare and Krafton's wild public feud with Subnautica developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underneath Krafton and Cleveland's cross-fired accusations is a single (apparently $250 million) question: is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ready to launch in Early Access this year?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton claims it isn't, saying that the current Early Access build "falls short in terms of content volume." Cleveland stated in a Reddit post last week that he, McGuire, and Gill "know" that the game is ready for Early Access release. "While we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's no independent standard to apply regarding a game's readiness for Early Access. However a former indie publisher lead producer (who requested anonymity to speak freely to protect sensitive information) explained that at their former employer, games entered Early Access "largely feature-complete." "Every update in Early Access was about bringing more playtime content," they explained. "We got several iterations ahead before Early Access, so that there were about 1.5 updates ready and waiting to ship in those first 6-8 weeks before launch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of those updates would be "fully planned and packaged," going through a full pass by QA, and another "half-cooked" to accommodate player feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess">According to Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Early Access program allows developers to sell their game on Steam "while it is being developed," and provides context to customers that a game should be considered "unfinished" in its current state. There aren't any hard guidelines, just rules on what developers aren't allowed to do while releasing a game in this fashion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-is-discontinuing-nintendo-switch-game-vouchers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo is discontinuing Switch Game Vouchers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Under those terms, even if Krafton felt the game needed more content before launch, one could reasonably state that so long as the met Steam's release guidelines, it could be "ready" to release in Early Access in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Krafton has promised to commit to "fair and equitable" compensation for the developers at Unknown Worlds, and that the company will "provide the rewards they were promised." When reached for comment, a Krafton spokesperson declined to provide further statements on the situation.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
