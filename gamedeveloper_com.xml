At the time of publication on July 13, Totally Human Media reports that 7,818 titles on Steam have disclosed GenAI usage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back on April 24, 2024, the outlet ran a similar report. By that time, the number of games disclosing GenAI use on Steam was around 1,000. Now, according to Lambe, that number has been octupled. In other words, the figure is around 7 percent of the total of Steam library, and a little under 20 percent of all games released so far this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of what the GenAI usage entails, this includes generation of visual assets, audio, text, and narrative. It's also present in marketing and promotional materials, as well as games' internal code and logic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Despite GenAI disclosures, some games are selling hundreds of thousands of copies">Despite GenAI disclosures, some games are selling hundreds of thousands of copies</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the report, Lambe notes that the use of GenAI during gameplay is increasing. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nyric</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players can use text inputs to generate biomes from a pre-loaded cache of assets at runtime. Other examples include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AI Roguelite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which uses the tech to "live-generate ingame content," including text, images, and sound effects, as well as making "game mechanics decisions in real time."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A notable example is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>inZOI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, published by Krafton on March 27. The company branded it as a "long-term franchise" after it hit 1 million sales a week after release.

In addition, actions and thoughts of characters are controlled through "sLM technology," which enables "more engaging and intuitive interactions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>inZOI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still quite popular.
