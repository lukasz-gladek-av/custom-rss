It has a simple interface, is easy to understand, features no ads, and is free to play. Guess a five-letter word in six tries, come back the next day for another. So when it was released in October 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, it caught on very quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just a few months later, The New York Times bought it for a price "in the low seven figures." A few years later, it's still a gigantic hit, having been played more than 4.8 billion times in 2023 alone. It's so big that when the organization's tech union went on strike in November 2024, workers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/guild-builds/">made versions of its game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">s, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that users could play instead of crossing the picket line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s massive popularity is just one inflection point in the history of newspaper games—typically word or number puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku, and other games you play once per day. These kinds of games have been popular for over a century, and almost every mainstream subscription publication you can think of has their own.&nbsp;</span></p><p>via New York Times</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there was something about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that made publications and platforms take notice. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pinpoint-queens-crossclimb-game-lakshman-somasundaram-k1zwc/">LinkedIn launched</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> three "thinking-oriented games" in May 2024, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/cinematrix-vulture-movie-trivia-grid-game.html">Vulture unveiled Cinematrix</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a grid-based movie trivia guessing game, in February. Subscription-based games platform Puzzmo launched in late 2023, offering standard fare like crosswords along with experimental endeavors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-Up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an oddly satisfying and challenging combination of poker and Sudoku. It was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hearst.com/-/hearst-newspapers-acquires-puzzle-games-platform-puzzmo">acquired by Hearst Newspapers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a couple months later, and can be played across multiple websites like the San Francisco Chronicle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wardle says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s success is tied to its simplicity. "I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">he told the New York Times</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It's something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day… Like, it doesn’t want any more of your time than that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experts interviewed for this article agree on this… to a point. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a simple yet effective game that appeals to almost everyone. However, it also benefited from great timing, releasing during a pandemic where people were aching for community in a world where building it felt impossible, and showed what still needed to be done to push daily games to the next level. It was time for a change.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is The New York Times a gaming company?">Is The New York Times a gaming company?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The leader in the newspaper games space is undoubtedly the New York Times. Its crossword is one of the most well known, and puzzle editor Will Shortz might be as close to a household name as puzzle editors get. It was already a huge draw before the publication bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and has become even more important in the age of digital subscriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As traditional publications struggle with subscriber counts and making a profit, the New York Times has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/315041/new-york-times-company-digital-subscribers/">increased its numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> almost every year since 2014. This is thanks in part to a bundle that costs $25 per month and packs in subscriptions for both its games app and the paper itself. Its investment into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is just one part of its growth strategy. As of November 2023, it had around 100 team members—up from around a dozen over the past decade—and has since hired more in community and design. “The half joke that is repeated internally is that The New York Times is now a gaming company that also happens to offer news," one anonymous staffer told </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/inside-the-new-york-times-big-bet-on-games">Vanity Fair</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You'd be forgiven for wanting to call the New York Times a gaming company. According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/08/2024/the-new-york-times-is-testing-a-new-puzzle-called-zorse">Semafor</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the NYT Games app was downloaded more than 10 million times in 2023. But despite this success and growth, Times executive editor Joseph Kahn maintains it's not looking to create a games studio, telling Vanity Fair that the company is not "Activision, and I don’t think we’re looking to become that." "These are brainteaser games for smart people who want a challenge in the course of the day. So I see them as very complementary, but not replacement, products for a news organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times is very much a media organization first, but since buying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which requires players to find four groups of words among 16 new ones each day. Semafor reports that it's been played around 2.3 billion times. It also released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game inspired by word searches, and is currently testing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zorse,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a phrase guessing game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s undeniable that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a big tipping point for us,” chief product officer Alex Hardiman told Vanity Fair. But “it’s not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only. It’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> driving more attention to other games, allowing us to invest more in games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The pandemic's affect on daily games">The pandemic's affect on daily games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> massive popularity isn't the only reason for the rise in daily games. It was also spurred on in part by the pandemic, where people stuck inside with little to do were looking for a bit of routine to fill their day. Video game popularity and sales </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html">surged during the pandemic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2020/03/28/video-games-whos-prescription-solace-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2932976001/">World Health Organization encouraging people</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to play games during lockdown. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> capitalized on that by being one of those tiny daily tasks. You solve one puzzle per day, and you're locked out until the next.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stella Zawistowski, a puzzle constructor for Vulture, the New Yorker, and other publications, says that the pandemic "accelerated" the daily games space because people were looking for something that "makes you feel a little smarter." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also had a secret weapon: a feature that automatically created a colored grid of your results that you could copy onto Twitter/X or a group message.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't think [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] would have been successful if you could just play as many times as you want every day," Zawistowski said. "I don't think it would have been nearly as successful if you couldn't post your score on Insta, on Twitter, on Facebook because then it gets people talking about it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That community building is one of video games' greatest strengths, and that's all the more relevant with daily games. The New York Times has been slowly building up community, adding stats to its games and allowing people to join forums (although they're mostly just links to comment sections), but its success is often in spite of its lack of features. So many people play New York Times games, and there are a lot of chances to go viral. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has become a viral hit in certain circles thanks to the chaotic nature of some of the solutions (a long running joke about how users see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/life/2024/07/connections-nyt-today-wordle-wyna-liu.html">editor Wyna Liu as their nemesis</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been the subject of many TikToks and memes). That's why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> co-creator Zach Gage believes that it doesn't have a lot to offer for many online players.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Their platform is terrible," Gage said. "It's terrible in the sense that it is non-existent. Their platform is a website with a bunch of links to games, and then you go and play the games, and the games don't really interact with that website where you started."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage noted that during the pandemic, he noticed that his wife was playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Words with Friends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a mobile, multiplayer version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scrabble</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with family through multiple group chats. I see something similar among people who play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even in 2024, I know people in group chats that are specifically for sharing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If this was any other game that was big, there would be a social space that was connected to this game that everybody would just be able to enjoy… Why isn't there a social space for players like that?" Gage said.</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage, known for daily games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Really Bad Chess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SpellTower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2023 with engineer Orta Therox not only as a place to house his games, but to fill a gap that the New York Times left behind in terms of community building. There are leaderboards, social features like friend requests, easy access to a Discord server where players and constructors gather, and daily announcements discussing how well people did on puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even LinkedIn noted the potential for games to connect people as its reasoning for adding daily games to its platform. You play one of the three four available at the time of this writing—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pinpoint, Queens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossclimb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—then see which of your connections have played. You can also then head over to leaderboards or immediately hop into the official post to talk with other people. It's barebones, but it works as a little push to socialize over its games.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"You share your knowledge and get knowledge back, you share your experiences and hear about others’ own roads. And with games, you finish a puzzle and then talk about it with colleagues, friends, and distant connections," editor in chief and VP at LinkedIn said in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bringing-professionals-together-games-daniel-roth-mxnfe/?trackingId=MdaPeLw5RO2vvQU%2Fvg5asg%3D%3D">games announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of an old format">The evolution of an old format</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It makes sense that the New York Times would be the market leader in the daily games space just due to age and brand recognition—it debuted in 1942, so it's had the time to build up a name for itself. But it's been making changes to keep it up to date for 2024. It's fallen behind in regards to community building, but it's been working on its reputation for being stodgy, traditional, highbrow, and almost completely inaccessible. The only way to get good at a New York Times crossword isn't to know random trivia, but to do them over and over again so you start learning the answers to favorite clues and notice patterns.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are better ways to do this, if you want them. A priority for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was to provide multiple difficulty experiences in one app. If you want to solve a crossword without any hints, you can. If you want to go for some extra sidequests in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-Up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and engage further with a game's mechanics, you can do that as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing I've noticed is The New York Times tends to target either super high-end players or super low-end players," Gage said. "Their crossword is not very approachable for people who've never played a crossword, and their game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not very interesting for people who are really deep into games and want a deep experience… In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our focus is on building games that work for anybody."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Puzzle constructor Brooke Husic leads the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crossword, which is a great example of this balancing act. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crosswords vary in terms of difficulty, but that's not defined by the obtuseness of the clues. The crossword allows you to use multiple hints before revealing the answer, and&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want somebody who's like, we have some of the best speed solvers in the world solving [the crossword] every day. And I want them to be there. I really want them to be there," Husic said. "But at the same time, I want someone who's never solved a crossroad before to go to post about any day and have it be their first crossword, and have a good experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times, for what it's worth, has been making changes to increase the accessibility of its puzzles, specifically its crossword. Everdeen Mason became the newspaper's first editorial director of games in 2021, and she told Vanity Fair that while the Times had to maintain the difficulty it's known for, it wants to be more accessible for newer players. "If we’re asking people to pay for a product that’s primarily this thing that they can’t access, then that’s not very smart," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the sheer amount of thematic variety out there that lets players choose which crosswords or games they might prefer, a more diverse array of constructors and editors have also been behind some of the most well-known puzzle sections. The New York Times is no longer run by purely white men; Mason is a black woman who dyes her hair, wears anime shirts in interviews,&nbsp; and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/insider/puzzles-director-mason.html">immediately wanted to challenge the team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and "get people out of their comfort zones" with a Black History Month theme and more freelance constructors of different backgrounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zawistowski has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://paw.princeton.edu/article/crossword-constructors-are-mostly-male-heres-how-we-fix">written before</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about how crosswords are mostly constructed by men, and began her career struggling against that establishment. "The partner I was working with was an older, retired, white guy, and so he would put Boomer references in his puzzles, and then I would have to clue them. It's just that's not who I am, whereas now I can put in the things that I love&nbsp; and then the puzzle feels more like me," Zawistowski said. But now, she's been able to stop freelancing in advertising and make puzzles full-time, and can make them on her terms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making puzzles feel more personal has been successful for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Husic ensures that crossword players have the chance to learn about the constructor and the process behind making that particular puzzle in notes that pop up after you've completed it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What was important to me was to make it very clear that humans made these, individuals made these and they cared so much about every choice," Husic said. It's a chance to engage with the player beyond just presenting a daily puzzle. "I have always wanted to exalt individual voices. Yeah, there's so many people who don't know that humans write crosswords. People think that computers are generating them, or they think Will Shortz writes every New York Times crossword."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How long will this boom last?">How long will this boom last?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like with many fads and industries, there will be players who get tired and get interested in something else. The New York Times is invested in its games because of how much they do for the company, and it's hired dozens of staffers to get that done.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But daily games must continue innovating to stay relevant. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> releases new games all the time—most in an experimental, early access phase, and ropes in its audience for feedback. It also tries out twists on old formats. Crosswords typically fit inside a standard square grid thanks to old-school paper restraints, but Husic and the constructors literally think outside the box by playing around with the size and shape of the puzzles. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo’</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s approach to grid design exemplifies its goals in bringing a human touch to games," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2024/07/31/puzzmo-constructors/">wrote one intern back in August</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are, like, over 100 million people who are ready for the next </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game and will jump in and play it when it happens…&nbsp; that's the sort of thing that all these businesses that are looking into the space are looking at right now. They want to be the people who have that game when it happens, because it's going to happen," Gage said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's all expected. Industries ebb and flow, and the same will happen to daily games. But in the meantime, the daily games surge is providing new outlets for constructors and new ways to play. It's unclear if we'll ever get another </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">but the daily games space and its millions of players will be there when it's ready.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
