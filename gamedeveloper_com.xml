A cause of death was not disclosed, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/beloved-game-veteran-carter-lipscomb-passes-away/">VentureBeat</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> noted his history of heart disease.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His family published a statement from him on his Facebook page, stating he "'fell out' for the last time, even though I was healthy and everything was goin’ great. I guess it was my time to go. Luckily, I was blessed to have my family nearby."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Whether you knew me as 'Doctor Business,' 'The Boss of the Special Sauce,' or just a 'brother from another mother,' I truly cherished every experience we’ve shared and every laugh we’ve had," he wrote. "Because of each of you, I’ve been blessed to be on this journey with you!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lipscomb began his industry career in QA at Maxis on 1990's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SimEarth: The Living Planet. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">After more QA gigs, he became a marketing director at GameTek in 1994. One of his most high-level positions was at SIE in 2007, where he served as PR director for PlayStation's platforms and products until 2018. He then joined Iron Galaxy as its business development specialist (or "Doctor Business").</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After news of Lipscomb's passing, several developers eulogized him, including former Iron Galaxy CEO Adam Boyes. "I loved him so much, and we were all so lucky to have met him and for him to have blessed our lives," said Boyes. "R.I.P., brother!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We lost a brother today," wrote former ex-SIE head </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1892745529169158441">Shawn Layden</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "The best of us. A light so bright our eyes may never adjust to the dark. Godspeed, Carter. Save us a table. We shall raise glasses again."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a message to VentureBeat, developer Tammy McDonald remembered Lipscomb as "the glue for our weekly Covid cocktail gatherings. He went out of his way to be there for me when Matt passed away... He was always [the] heart and the very definition of a ‘work family.'"</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

Previously, he took a hands-off approach with NetEase Games, but sources told the outlet his direct involvement over the past year has been "dramatic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current staff expressed concern about Ding's focus on moneymakers and disinterest in any project that wouldn't generate "hundreds of millions of dollars per year."

Ding reportedly wanted to avoid paying licensing fees to Disney so it could use popular characters like Spider-Man and Wolverine, and allegedly told NetEase artists to use their own hero designs instead of Marvel-made ones. The attempted cancelation, which NetEase later denied to Bloomberg, was said to have cost "millions of dollars."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this week, a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">United States support team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rivals </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was laid off.
