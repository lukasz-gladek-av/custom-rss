You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it," continues the update.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA has emphasized the two parties remain "frustratingly far apart," but says employers are beginning to "feel the squeeze."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With their previously signed projects dragging their way through the production pipeline, employers are feeling the squeeze from the strike, as SAG-AFTRA members who work in video games continue to stand together and refuse to work without adequate protections," said the union.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is causing employers to seek other performers they can exploit to fill those roles, including those who don’t typically perform in games. If you’re approached for such a role, we urge you to seriously consider the consequences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Not only would you be undermining the efforts of your fellow members, but you would be putting yourself at risk by working without protections against AI misuse. And 'AI misuse' is just a nice way of saying that these companies want to use your performance to replace you—without consent or compensation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf">published a comparison chart of AI proposals</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to highlight how the proposals tabled by the bargaining group differ from its own.
