Meanwhile, 17 percent of developers were reported to have "neutral" feelings about the tech.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After ChatGPT hit the market, generative AI tools were suddenly everywhere, and a lot of game developers and other creators seemed apprehensive at first—but today, 79 percent of devs polled report feeling positive about using AI in gaming, while a mere 5 percent are apprehensive," reads the report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the report indicates sentiment towards AI tools is shifting, it claims AI uptake is merely "holding steady."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Devs report picking up AI tools at a similar rate to last year, but AI applications and use cases have matured considerably in the interim. They've grown faster and are better trained, and we as users have honed our ability to guide generative AI toward desired results as AI use has grown normalized," it continues.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/players-lambast-activision-after-publisher-confirms-generative-ai-was-used-in-black-ops-6" target="_self" data-discover="true">Players lambast Activision after publisher confirms generative AI was used in Black Ops 6</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the chart below shows, over 40 percent of developers said they have used AI to deliver automated playtesting, improve character animations, and write or improve code.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">30 percent explained they have used AI tools to facilitate adaptive difficulty, and 35 percent said they have leveraged AI to generate artwork and game levels. Only 4 percent of respondents said they haven't used AI tools at all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Since AI tool use is so much more widespread a year later, the slight downtick in several categories—adaptive difficulty, generative art, and writing or narrative design—is striking. It may suggest that devs may be less interested in exploring AI tools in creative or problem-solving dimensions of game development, possibly because they’ve tested these use cases and haven’t been leveraging strong concerns there," adds the report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Meanwhile, AI use for automated playtesting, moderating in-game comms, and improving code have risen, implying that AI tools (so far) are most effectively used in support capacities, rather than generating original work."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-games-confirms-layoffs-amid-industry-turmoil-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Surgeon Simulator developer Bossa Games confirms layoffs amid industry 'turmoil'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Unity, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/ai">which offers a number of AI-powered tools</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, claims developers have pinned their colors to the generative AI mast—there is some evidence to suggest that might not necessarily be the case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai">According to the GDC's 2025 State of the Game Industry Report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, only 13 percent of developers surveyed felt generative AI tools would have a "positive impact" on the industry.
