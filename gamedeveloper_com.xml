If multiple games were featured in a Daily Deal, or one game had multiple purchase options (like a deluxe edition), those are individually featured in the breakdowns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, the Daily program will now include six spots, up from the previous four. According to Valve, the four spots "let Steam better match the right game with the right player," which it wants to continue.

And in terms of revenue, Daily Deal titles would earn "anywhere from ~$10,000 to $2,000,000."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Changes were also introduced, such as letting developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/valve-is-beta-testing-a-new-system-that-lets-steam-devs-schedule-daily-deals">schedule</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when their game gets include in a Daily Deal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More information on Steam's Daily Deal changes can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/497186807117513037">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
