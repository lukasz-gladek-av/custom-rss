The platform said it's a tweak that will largely impact "certain kinds of adult content." The change is there for all to see on the Steamworks website, but 404 Media has published a robust breakdown of the situation by leaning on data from SteamDB to look at how the change is already impacting the popular PC storefront.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'Krafton decided to go nuclear:' Unknown Worlds founders claim Subnautica 2 is being held hostage in lawsuit"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-krafton-decided-to-go-nuclear-unknown-worlds-founders-claim-subnautica-2-is-being-held-hostage-in-lawsuit">'Krafton decided to go nuclear:' Unknown Worlds founders claim Subnautica 2 is being held hostage in lawsuit</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Krafton remains at loggerheads with the ousted founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds.

All three co-founders subsequently announced plans to file a lawsuit against the publisher.

Our writeup includes all of wildest allegations—which Krafton has previously refuted by claiming the Unknown Worlds execs were fired for abandoning their duties.

During our chat, multiple employees claimed the art outsourcing studio was sabotaged by Testronic, which is accused of neglecting to provide contract work to the team and preventing them from advertising their services to clients directly in order to force their closure. The bigger picture, explained those who spoke with us, is that Testronic wants to focus on Secret 6's other office in Manila, where working conditions are "much more precarious and wages much lower." Testronic has yet to respond to our repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, Secret 6 Madrid workers have confirmed they will strike if the company doesn't meet their demands for fair severance.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wardogs-developer-bulkhead-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Wardogs developer Bulkhead is laying off workers</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'Our lives were upended:' ZeniMax union workers respond to Microsoft layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-future-has-been-stolen-zenimax-union-workers-respond-to-microsoft-layoffs">'Our lives were upended:' ZeniMax union workers respond to Microsoft layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Unionized workers at ZeniMax Online Studios have lambasted parent company Microsoft over its decision to make a significant (but unknown) number of workers redundant across Xbox Game Studios.

Although they confirmed nobody in the union has been laid off yet—largely because it remains in negotiations with Microsoft over the cuts—it's possible that some members will be impacted. "Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support," read a statement published on social media. Microsoft has yet to comment on the scale of the cuts within its video game division specifically.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Laid off King staff set to be replaced by the AI tools they helped build, say sources"><a target="_blank" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">Laid off King staff set to be replaced by the AI tools they helped build, say sources</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via mobilegamer.biz // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of those Microsoft layoffs... multiple sources have told mobilegamer.biz that Candy Crush developer King, which is under the ownership of the U.S. tech giant, is jettisoning a number of employees to replace them with the very AI tools they created and trained. Bloomberg previously reported that 200 people would be made redundant at King, and multiple sources now claim morale is in the "gutter" as the company prepares to supplant its human workforce with AI automatons. "The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it’s all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall," said one source. It's a sentiment we suspect will sound worryingly familiar to a lot of developers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Summer Games Done Quick raises over $2.4 million for Doctors Without Borders"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamesdonequick.com/post/3ltteenpufs2v">Summer Games Done Quick raises over $2.4 million for Doctors Without Borders</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via SGDQ on Bluesky //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In case you needed a little cheering up, here's a reminder of how video games and the wider industry can still be an immense force for good. Summer Games Done Quick 2025 finished earlier this week after raising a colossal $2,436,614 for humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders. The annual speed running event continues to demonstrate that there are plenty of people with heart and empathy within the video game industry. Oh, I wonder how the world might be if a few more of them were sitting in C-suites.

Platform owner Roblox Corp has partnered with a number of IP holders (with more to come, apparently) so users can license their properties when creating their own Roblox jaunts. Creators will only be able to license an IP if they meet the demands of their respective owners. Sega, for instance, wants to know creators are capable of pulling in over 1,000 daily active users before granting them permission to use the Like a Dragon license. Netflix, meanwhile, has opened Squid Game and Stranger Things to even the smallest creator—although their revenue share offering isn't quite as generous as their peers. More on that in the full story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Virtuos axes 7 percent of its global workforce to adapt for the &quot;future of game development&quot;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">Virtuos axes 7 percent of its global workforce to adapt for the "future of game development"</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Virtuos //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It's important to quote companies directly when they announce hundreds of layoffs to underline just how vacuous their statements have become. Yesterday, global game service provider Virtuos said it must make hundreds of people redundant so it can (and here comes the punchline) "strengthen" its offering in "high-value co-development." Virtuos currently employs over 4,200 people according to its website, so you can expect a hefty chunk of its workforce to be punted out the door. The company has confirmed the layoffs will impact about 200 roles in Asia and 70 in Europe—but stated that number includes "fewer than 10 in France" where the core team working on acclaimed title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is located.
