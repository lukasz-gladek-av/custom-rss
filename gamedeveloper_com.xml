Lake has been recognized for being a "true visionary whose work continues to pave the way for narrative-focused game design and visually striking universes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know a Remedy game when you see it, largely due to Sam Lake’s impact on the worlds he creates," wrote NYVGCC president Harold Goldberg. "It’s really cool to see how his 20-year career at Remedy has touched so many of our members and interns at the Circle, and we are thrilled to have him join the roster of esteemed game changers previously recognized with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lake joined Remedy as a writer for its debut title, 1995's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Rally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Over the years, he's written or been the creative director (or both) on nearly every game developed by the studio, from the original Max Payne games to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake, Quantum Break,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the Remedy-made story campaigns for Smilegate's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossfire X</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

I don’t think anyone expects anything less from someone like Sam Lake."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to games, Lake also co-wrote two Alan Wake books and a Max Payne comic book. This past summer, Remedy struck a deal with Annapurna to adapt Alan Wake and Control for TV and film, but his involvement in those projects is currently unknown.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Game Awards will air on Tuesday, January 21, 2025.
