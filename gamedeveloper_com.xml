A number of workers from those teams have now joined Compass. Others have been laid off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As part of the strategic refocus that we announced in September, we regrettably lost talented members of our teams and also altered our multi-studio development structure," said a company spokesperson.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This unfortunately meant closing nDreams Studio Orbital and meant that nDreams Studio could not continue in its current form. Both teams did brilliant work and many people from those affected studios have been retained within nDreams’ new look structure, with several of those forming part of the new Compass studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Compass will be led by former Activision, EA, and King veteran Callum Godfrey, who previously worked on franchises including Call of Duty and Operation Flashpoint.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 40-person team intends to target the "growing audience of young VR natives" by rapidly prototyping games while learning from data and communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio will take a "democratic approach" to development by allowing any team member to pitch game concepts.
