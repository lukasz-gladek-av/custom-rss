But it begs the question: How have fluctuating trade relationships impacted the company’s U.S. rollout? And what challenges might it face in the future?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A controlled launch">A controlled launch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-screen-punctures-raise-questions-over-hardware-packaging">a few non-tariff related hiccups</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the initial rollout of the Switch 2 has been successful, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-tops-3-5-million-sales-in-four-days-to-deliver-nintendo-s-biggest-console-launch">selling more than 3.5 million units</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its first four days on the market, according to Nintendo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many consoles were secured via pre-order, despite Nintendo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/u-s-tariff-pause-could-give-nintendo-time-to-amass-a-switch-2-stockpile">initially delaying</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> them in response to the new tariffs unveiled by the Trump administration in early April. The pause — which the company lifted April 24 — was a short-term play, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Just pausing pre-orders, but not doing anything else, just buys you time to observe,” said Joseph Fitzgerald, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Nintendo went full steam ahead with its plans following the pre-order pause, many consumer goods companies have been taking more long-term wait-and-see approaches to tariffs, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/prologis-warehouse-outlook-tariffs/745829/">some stockpiling inventory</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to delay more drastic actions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s unclear how Nintendo handled the initial tariff shock beyond the pause, as the company did not respond to a request for comment. However, according to Sally Peng, senior managing director and leader of export controls, sanctions and trade for the Asia-Pacific region at FTI Consulting, it may have built up a certain amount of Switch 2 inventory ahead of launch to ensure it could meet the initial rush.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Strategizing for the long term">Strategizing for the long term</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no quick fix to stave off the impact of tariffs for consumer electronics makers like Nintendo, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just moving a single company’s production operation would be challenging enough, according to Fitzgerald. It takes roughly nine to 12 months to move production to different geographies, he said, and that’s just the start. Companies often want to be using a facility for five to 10 years to be confident it can meet demand and quality standards sufficiently for a device like the Switch 2, he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the level of complexity required to shift production, consumer electronics makers in North America are putting a lot of “calories” into rebalancing, Fitzgerald added. Locations that are receiving the most attention include Latin America, eastern Europe and countries in Southeast Asia beyond China.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving production to the U.S. is another option, but complications remain even if a company like Nintendo were to invest in such a move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You end up having to have this discussion around, hey, can you also mirror our supply chain in this location, or are you going to continue to provide from an outside the United States location, and what is our cost difference?” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Relocating a company’s own production footprint is challenging enough. But game console makers rely on thousands of components and coordinate with large partner ecosystems to make devices that can be sold at consumer-friendly prices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“That Tier 2, Tier 3 alignment in these locations is really the biggest thing that’s under threat when you’re kind of vacillating in policy,” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The total supply chain costs of different tariff strategies will determine which long-term gambits electronics manufacturers make in response to a shifting global trade environment. These line items include procurement, logistics and labor costs, among others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So, if we look at all these three costs together and together as a landed cost, it’ll be much healthier to make your decision in times of uncertainty, which is kind of the understatement of the year,” FTI’s Peng said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is some precedent for successfully completing this type of supply chain retooling, according to Peng, who highlighted apparel and footwear as a sector that is ahead of many other industries in this regard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Very many years ago, they already figured out that other than labor costs, duty costs or tariff costs are a big part of their total cost,” Peng said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The real challenge comes next">The real challenge comes next</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Nintendo weathered the tariff onslaught during the Switch 2’s launch, the real test for the console’s first year lies in the months ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other consumer goods makers, Nintendo will need to bring in orders during the summer’s peak shipping season to prepare for holiday demand. Due to the current trade environment, that will mean either rush ordering to take advantage of the Trump administration’s current tariff reprieve or eating higher shipping costs when and if currently paused tariffs go back into place.</span></p><p>Image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The holiday season drives hardware and software sales for the video game industry. Sales in the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 accounted for 37% of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240206e.pdf">Nintendo’s global sales in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, per Supply Chain Dive calculations. Roughly 60% of U.S. revenue for the company, which does not publicly report regional earnings, comes from sales at the end of the year, former Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/reggie-fils-aime-nintendo-makes-60-of-u-s-revenue-during-holiday-season">said in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo is expecting</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-expects-the-switch-2-to-sell-15-million-units-in-nine-months"> to sell 15 million units</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the Switch 2 globally over the next eight months. But to reach that mark, it must contend with a potential return of the Trump administration’s country-specific reciprocal tariffs next month to meet its U.S. sales forecast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tariffs on imports from China have been lowered until mid-August while other country-specific duties are paused until early July. Even with the reprieve window, which has led to a pickup in shipments, imports are expected to drop 6.2% year over year in June and 8.1% YoY in July, per </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/import-cargo-levels-expected-to-see-surge-during-pause-in-tariff-increases">the National Retail Federation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with even more drastic reductions expected for the rest of the year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reducing shipments due to higher tariffs or slower demand won’t create a silver lining of saved costs for Nintendo, though, according to Peng. New console rollouts are planned so far in advance that the company likely already has the material to produce more consoles, Peng said. Meanwhile, production in China and other countries in Southeast Asia targeted by Trump’s tariffs has slowed down in the first half of 2025, she added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So, we’re not just talking about finished goods not being able to ship. They already sunk a lot of costs into preparing the material or securing the material,” Peng said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the tariff-driven uncertainty, Nintendo and other consumer electronics makers are being forced to make atypical decisions during this time of year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“How aggressive do I go in terms of chasing those back orders? And do I only plan to fulfill supply for, say, 30 days at a time, which inherently limits my max capacity that I can fulfill,” Fitzgerald said. “So any launch, I would assume, has a longer backlog fulfillment period because companies are going to inch along in that fulfillment process due to uncertainty.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The potential Nintendo advantage">The potential Nintendo advantage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has remained confident in its ability to meet demand in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-doesn-t-expect-production-issues-to-impact-switch-successor">face of production challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, even as tariffs continue to rankle supply chains. While not immune to duties given its production footprint in Vietnam and China, as well as being a Japan-based company, Nintendo holds a unique position in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since Nintendo’s success with the Wii console, first introduced in 2006, the company has broken away from its major competitors (Microsoft and PlayStation) with a distinct development strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the last two decades, Nintendo deprioritized processing speeds and graphical fidelity for unique hardware mechanics such as motion controls and portability. This approach is part of a more family-focused product strategy for Nintendo. In contrast, Microsoft and Sony continue to primarily target the 18-34 demographic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of its strategy — and its video game consoles generally— there is a built-in demand protection, even if tariffs fuel higher prices. Nintendo has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/">committed to its initially announced price of $449</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the Switch 2, but it said console accessories will experience price adjustments due to “changes in market conditions.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Video games are unique because there’s only one of that platform, right? And you’re not really competing [with other businesses],” Fitzgerald said. “They’re a category of one unto themselves.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is especially true for Nintendo, whose best-selling first-party games are exclusive to its console. Sony and Microsoft, meanwhile, have released first-party titles on other platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, because Nintendo’s console release cadence is not on the same cycle as Xbox and Playstation, which often launch new generations at the same time. Therefore, it can stand alone among the big three console makers this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Supply Chain Dive are sibling organizations under Informa TechTarget.</span></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
