When enabled, developers can integrate payments, allow in-game purchases, and create custom storefronts without the tie-in from closed platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Xsolla, users will be able to retain more revenue while maintaining full ownership of the checkout process, as well as player data and monetization strategy. The drop-in integration with Unity allows users to seamlessly integrate payments, web shops, and other direct-to-consumer solutions into Unity projects, with support across iOS, Android, PC, and web.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On mobile, for example, Unity iOS games allow for external link-outs via the Xsolla Buy Button for in-app purchases in the U.S. Meanwhile, the SDK allows for distributing Unity games in Europe via notarization, marketplaces, and side-loading, while enabling alternative billing. As per Android, the SDK allows distribution of Unity-built APKs globally through side-loading, and supports user choice billing (UCB and non-UCB) across Europe, India, and South Korea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unity developers are pushing creative boundaries every day, and they deserve the same freedom when it comes to monetization," said Chris Hewish, president, communication and strategy at Xsolla, in the announcement. "Our new SDK helps developers reach players directly, keep more revenue, and operate on their terms without giving up flexibility or global reach."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide:' Arkane union workers demand Xbox maker sever ties with Israel</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xsolla continues to push its direct-to-consumer strategy">Xsolla continues to push its direct-to-consumer strategy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In October of last year, Hewish, alongside senior VP of EMEA Chris Meredith, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-sure-seems-like-xsolla-wants-to-take-a-bite-out-platform-cuts-from-steam-other-platform-owners">spoke at length against</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "gatekeepers," noting that it's an "awfully congested market" for developers. Without mentioning any specific examples or storefronts, the pair spoke about the idea of "democratizing the business of gaming" by allowing devs to sell digitally to players directly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For us, with the relationship with the advertisers bringing their products to market, we are very much aware of trying to put them on the track of the [direct-to-consumer] roadmap, and if you're a small three man developer, that's quite challenging," Meredith said at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two months prior to the interview, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lawsuits-allege-ceo-of-payment-processor-xsolla-misused-company-funds">a report surfaced</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that six former executives had filed lawsuits against CEO Aleksandr "Shurick" Agapitov since 2019, with two of the lawsuits voicing concerns about the company's financial practices or how Agapitov reportedly used cash from the platform. One allegation claimed he transferred $120 million in company money to his personal accounts between 2021 and 2023. Xsolla's president, chief business officer David Stelzer, dismissed the report's claims and called the documents "inaccurate," adding that the company manages its financial affairs "responsibly and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fortnite-and-epic-games-store-heading-to-ios-in-australia-following-federal-court-ruling" target="_self" data-discover="true">Fortnite and Epic Games Store heading to iOS in Australia following Federal Court ruling</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
