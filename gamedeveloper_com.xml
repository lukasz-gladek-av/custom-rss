The broad aim is for this tech to assist players with speech disabilities or those who need help verbally expressing themselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers, EA suggests they could use this technology to "make it possible for those playersâ€™ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another patent highlighted is an internal plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that enables in-engine use of EA's previously open-sourced photosensitivity analysis tech, IRIS. The plugin now allows developers to catch potential photosensitivity issues in-engine and real-time as they run their games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The sooner you start testing, the sooner you find potential issues," said IRIS engineer Blanca Macazaga Zuaz. According to her, not many free or easy-to-use tools for photosensitivity analysis were available prior to IRIS. The free access takes down two barriers with one stone, which she called an "incredible feeling."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Previously, the Madden and Dragon Age publisher made technologies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/ea-will-let-devs-use-accessibility-tech-like-apex-legends-ping-system-for-free">Apex Legends' </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/ea-will-let-devs-use-accessibility-tech-like-apex-legends-ping-system-for-free">ping system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and voice controls for NPCs free-use.

More to come soon!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can see EA's newly updated crop of free-use accessibility patents </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire. In addition to Game Developer, his writing can be found at io9 over on Gizmodo. Don't ask him about how much gum he's had, because the answer will be more than he's willing to admit.</span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
