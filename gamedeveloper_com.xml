But there was a significant net loss as well, with losses being higher than predicted: $279.8 million compared to $207.2 million in Q2 2024. In regard for the guidance of the 2025 fiscal year, the projected consolidated net loss sits at around $1.2 billion, which is also higher than prior guidance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added disclaimers for each of the latter two points, attributing net loss due to a "timing mismatch of deferred revenue recognition and immediate operating expense recognition."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Roblox, the vast majority of Q2 bookings outperformance is "deferred and will be recognized as revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user," which was 27 months during Q2 2025. Meanwhile, the primary operating costs "outpaced" recognized revenue as the company's business scaled, resulting in a net loss increase. Regarding the consolidated net loss, the company points to this being the result of the raise in bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/battlefield-6-s-ugc-mode-is-the-heart-of-ea-s-live-service-aspirations-for-the-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Battlefield 6's Godot-powered UGC mode is the heart of EA's big live service swing for the series</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's interesting to compare the use of these disclaimers against the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">financials report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of Q1 2025. Back then, the company pointed out that its consolidated net loss ($216.3 million) was "better than the high end" of its guidance range of $287 million-$267 million, and "an improvement" over consolidated net loss in Q1 2024 of $271.9 million.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, also in Q1 2025, the net cash and cash equivalents by operating activities were $443.9 million, up 86 percent year-over-year, while free cash flow totalled $426.5 million and up 123 percent year-over-year. But the company attributed a benefit from the delay of a $30 million payout to a developer, which was moved to Q2. "Had we made this particular payment in Q1 2025 as originally intended, operating cash flow for the quarter would have been $413.9 million and free cash flow would have been $396.5 million," the company said at the time."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The rise of ">The rise of <span>Grow a Garden</span> isn't a one-person success story</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it's clear that Roblox is relying on hits like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grow a Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there are some important facts to take into consideration outside of financials alone.
