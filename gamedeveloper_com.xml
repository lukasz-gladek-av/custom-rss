His drone struck the Scooper's left wing and forced it to be grounded for repairs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By pleading guilty, he avoided a potential year in prison, and will have to perform 150 hours of community service in support of Southern California's wildfire relief efforts.
