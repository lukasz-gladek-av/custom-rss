Maybe you're a game writer or narrative designer looking a home for brass-tacks discussion about the craft? Welcome, dear readers, to Narrative Notebook, my new column inspired by my side work in the world of indie games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have a very simple philosophy of storytelling in video games: great games writing is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>everywhere</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in games. We just don't always have the tools to spot it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/opinion-marvel-s-guardians-of-the-galaxy-does-dadification-so-dang-right">opportunities in the past</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to gush about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/you-should-take-a-look-at-how-horizon-zero-dawn-handles-the-apocalypse">great storytelling moments</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in games, but they came at something of an irregular cadence. That's made it trickier to discuss broad topics or keep regular track of advancements in the field. I want Narrative Notebook to be a resource for everyone who needs a touch of storytelling—no matter how big or small—to make their game special.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It'll also be a home for narrative inspirations </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>outside</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of games. I want to help developers see how to harvest emotions and themes from works outside the interactive world.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: Designing the User Experience of Game Development Tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We're kicking off this series with a look at The Game Bakers' sci-fi mountain climbing adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's already destined to be one of my favorite games of 2026. The game's climbing system and vertical level design are technical and creative wonders, and its stunning art direction is a feast for the eyes. But what I was most surprised by was the story's protagonist, Aava.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In video games when we meet characters determined to accomplish an impossible task, they're often positioned as eager go-getters. But Aava is something different—a prickly person often rude and abrasive to the people she encounters. She's a case study in contrasts, and a great reference point for developers looking to tell morally nuanced stories in the video game medium.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Aava is an athlete struggling to keep her humanity">Aava is an athlete struggling to keep her humanity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spoiler warning - we'll be discussing the plot of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Cairn</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in great detail below.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I spoke with The Game Bakers creative director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-">Emeric Thoa</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in 2024, he described </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s emotional core as being inspired by the intense rush that climbers feel making it to the top of a climb.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thoa described how this emotion informed Aava's character in an interview in a December 2025 interview on the official PlayStation blog. "She’s demanding, perfectionist, and can't stand failure. And when she conquers a difficult route, when she pauses for a moment on a ledge with a breathtaking view, she feels free. It's for moments like these that she climbs—that's her main drive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That "main drive" is more overwhelming with Aava than in most other characters I've seen with similar motivation. As the story progresses, players are likely to be surprised by how little warmth this fictional celebrity solo climber shows for anyone else in the story. She screams in anger any time her partner Naomi or handler Chris send messages. She's rude to Marco, a younger and less-jaded climber also scaling Kami and at first she shows no affection for Climberbot, her cute robot pal wordlessly supporting her journey up the mountain.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/danielle-riendeau-s-top-three-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Danielle Riendeau's top 3 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This behavior doesn't just appear in cutscenes. Some of these interactions play out in barks that pop up during the climb, and there are a few key moments where the player can only proceed when they lash out at Marco.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Aava isn't always like this. Like many gruff protagonists, she warms up to Marco after initially telling him off. She's somber and reflective when studying journals left by other climbers and a native tribe called the Troglodytes. And her indifference to Climberbot turns to intense sorrow after she strikes it in a fit of anger.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a traditional arc, this would be a story where she lowers her guard and learns to let others in. But this is not a traditional arc. And Aava's journey isn't about love or warmth—it's about searching for the only thing that can make her feel alive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bryant Francis' top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What happens when you're only happy doing the impossible?">What happens when you're only happy doing the impossible?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also a fantastic case study in subtext. Players are trusted to pick up on Aava's emotional state through terse exchanges with other characters and the ignored messages from home. But the subtext hits a peak when late in the game, Aava sends a message home trying to express her feelings and why she's on this dangerous journey—and she can't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just because of exhaustion. Aava has lost so much of her humanity in search of the climb. The thing that makes her feel alive is the sensation of reaching the summit. Aava will only be happy when she—and the player—reach the mountain's summit. But Kami's environment is like Mt. Everest on steroids. The bodies of dead climbers litter the slopes all the way up, and to finish her journey is to risk life, not just limb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This becomes apparent after a devastating dream sequence midway through the game that uses Fleischer-era style animation entirely unlike anything else in the story. Aava has received news that would have sent most people turning around to rush down the mountain and comfort her loved ones—and instead all she can do about it is have nightmares and continue the climb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not for nothing, but what follows is also one of the most challenging sequences in the game. I muscled through it, refusing to reload an earlier save even after many failures, because I did not want to experience that dream sequence again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in 2023 I asked Thoa why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a science fiction adventure game and not just a climbing simulator (which maybe could have been a less-risky business proposal), he said the team at The Game Bakers loves games with some kind of meaning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, that meaning comes all from Aava's shattering sense of self, and players have to confront the question—what else is left for someone like her when they summit the highest peak in all the land?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fascinating how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pulls off this complex story without needing the subversive setpieces you might find in a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spec Ops: The Line</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In my own work, I've had to interpret characters through the lens of the player power fantasy—Aava makes me contemplate how writers can create complex characters without taking the player's attention away from the fun and rewarding parts of a game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="February inspirations: Bone Temples and Boston abolitionists">February inspirations: Bone Temples and Boston abolitionists</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As promised, I'm leaving you with a short list of works to look at outside of video games, with some notes on what to pay attention to.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later:_The_Bone_Temple">28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</a></span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Come for a study in how filmmakers hand off characters like batons, preserving their essence while changing cinematic direction.
