Nearly 20 years since its debut, Ubisoft is now taking the series to historical Japan with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">It's a setting that many fans of the series have wanted to see, and currently enjoying increased popularity due to FX's recent tv series Shogun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the historical setting of Japan has been the subject of many games, particularly the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, seeing it through the lens of Assassin's Creed is interesting. After all, this is a series that blends historical political conflicts with sci-fi and action-laden twists and the approach lends an opportunity to spotlight some often understated elements the history and politics of the era, while also reveling in the series' style of stealth gameplay and open world action.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though the shift to historical Japan seemed like an obvious turn for the series (ninjas seem like a natural fit for the Order of Assassins), the developers at Ubisoft Quebec expressed that—just like previous entries—bringing the series to Japan required education and a need to highlight different perspectives of the era.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's okay to make a small game:' Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet says tiny ideas contain huge potential</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with creative director Jonathan Dumont during a visit to Ubisoft Quebec in early 2025, he explained what drew the team to the setting, given it was historical period of great change.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why Assassin's Creed finally went to Japan">Why Assassin's Creed finally went to Japan</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The series featured multiple protagonists for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">goes about it differently by focusing on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-dual-protagonists-of-assassin-s-creed-shadows-enabled-the-series-jump-to-feudal-japan">two unique characters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with different gameplay styles and different perspectives on the changing era of Japan. The main narrative centers on the historical African samurai Yasuke (played by Tongayi Chirisa) and his new life in Japan, and Naoe (played by Masumi Tsunoda), a female ninja seeking to live up to her family's legacy to seek revenge, all set against the backdrop of the growing conflicts of the Sengoku period, with historical figures such as Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and outside Western influences paving the way for radical change in Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You always try to look for the thing that grabs you as a creator. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we chose Greece because we found the pull was the philosophy of that time, and that it was an era where that departed the land of myths to an age of reasoning with people like Socrates becoming more known," said the creative director. "So with Japan, what interested us was the nuance of the era's communities and the different sides of everything. It was a morally grey time period and the start of a global conflict in Japan as Western nations were coming to the country during that era of unification."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Dumont, some of the reasons why Ubisoft hadn't made an Assassin's Creed game set in Japan sooner were timing, developer availability, and limitations of the tech to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="http://gamedeveloper.com/programming/7-how-assassin-s-creed-shadows-makes-environments-look-great-up-close-and-at-a-distance">fully realize feudal Japan's architecture and surrounding wilderness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that changes with in-game seasons. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers not only saw an opportunity for the series to spotlight this era of Japan, but also showcase the atmosphere and changing culture of a country after the Western world cast its sights on it—all honed through the lens of Assassin's Creed and its focus on history's secret assassins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This setting was such a pivotal time in Japan's history, and the country became a melting pot, and life changed so dramatically during these 30 years of unification," said the creative director. "Cities were being built around castles, the samurai went from being guardians protecting [rural property] to becoming now centered around the city, and it also led to urbanization—like commerce changed quite a bit because there was such a demand at war, and so the merchants at that time became very rich, and they climbed the social ladder. All that made it such an interesting era to explore for Assassin's Creed."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This aspect of cultural change and exchange is reflected in Yasuke's story, one of the central characters of Shadows and the series' first protagonist based on a real person. During the game's prologue, players see him as an enslaved person brought to Japan by Jesuit missionaries, and on the opening walk to Oda Nobunaga's compound, citizens view him as a curiosity and comment on his black skin. After meeting with the feudal lord, Yasuke eventually begins a new life in Japan and trains as a samurai under Nobunaga, which sets him on a path to partnership with Naoe as they navigate 15th-century Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, Yasuke's appearance has garnered attention from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yves-guillemot-denounces-assassin-s-creed-shadows-racist-malicious-backlash">certain corners of the internet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who neither appreciate his inclusion as a protagonist in the game nor his place in real history— despite the fact that he's already appeared in other games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nioh </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Samurai Warriors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What this inherently racist criticism from these communities fails to consider is that Yasuke's place during this time period makes a compelling case for him as a protagonist and puts him very much in line with Assassin's Creed's focus on the strange, secret history of humanity.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, the developers felt Yasuke's experience as a foreigner in Japan would allow a global audience of players to see themselves in his journey as he immerses himself in the culture of the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach has precedent in the realm of popular fiction. James Clavell's 1975 book Shogun and the 2024 TV series of the same name introduce the fictional British sailor John Blackthorne (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_(samurai)">himself based on historical figure William Adams</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as an audience point-of-view character.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming students of history">Becoming students of history</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One particular detail that Dumont highlighted during the production was that Yasuke actor Tongayi Chirisa embodied the kind of mindset that they wanted for the character, possessing an open mind and a "student's mentality." This was the kind of aspect that they wanted for the character, but also a perspective that he wanted the developers to have as well when trying to develop Japan for AC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always think of making games like these as going back to school; you have to go back to the learning process—you look back on what you know, then look at what you're learning, and then compare that to what's out there in pop culture," said Dumont. "So it's really about being students ourselves, trying to learn as much as possible and being humble about it. It can be difficult to portray somebody else's culture, so you try to have a lot of people who can inform you or help you make the right choices. Traveling to Japan was awesome, working with the specialists was great, and all that changed how we viewed the setting and how we developed it as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside Yasuke is Naoe, the second playable protagonist who focuses on stealth gameplay and the traditional 'assassin' experience. In a way, Naoe is an outsider like Yasuke, and her experience represents the spiritual and emotional element of the game that highlights the harmony between nature and humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Naoe's side activities hidden throughout the open world are meditation rituals, which open up side missions to see her growth as a ninja from her father's training. One major activity that players can engage in is the town builder, an Animal Crossing-style mode focusing on building a community of allies and creating a town of your own. In this way, players will be able to see the details of the architecture and culture of the time, as well as how people find unity during difficult times.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Working on this game completely changes how we perceive architecture, and how much nature and humanity are linked together in harmony in Japan," said Dumont. "When you go into temples and shrines and the wilderness, it's very clear that there's a strong connection with everything. We didn't understand at the start of this project, but as we did our research in Japan, we realized we needed to focus more on that. So, looking at everything, we were like, "Oh yeah, okay! We need to spend more time on that," and it's made our experience all the better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a clear shift away from 2020's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">focuses on a more tightly designed world, which aims to put a clear spotlight on a period of Japan that's opening itself up to the larger world and how the protagonists build up a community. According to Dumont, this all taps into the game's core themes of unity and community, which he says is "the importance of taking care of each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does focus on the traditional AC style of experience where players engage in brutal combat, pull off assassinations of key targets, and parkour across an open-world during a chaotic period, the deep historical research creates a surprisingly inviting and wholesome tone, one that breaks new ground in the world of games inspired by the dramatic history of Feudal Japan.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet has some advice for GDC 2025 attendees lucky enough to find a spot in his packed out 'The making of Astro Bot' session: "It's okay to make a small game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're pertinent words in era of burgeoning production cycles and budgets—and ones that should hold weight given the critical and commercial performance of Team Asobi's effervescent platformer, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Introducing his point, Doucet surfaces a photograph of Team Asobi's onboarding handbook that states "we aim for quality, not quantity." Better to create a michelin star morsel than a greasy platter of overcooked sliders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Doucet, thinking small means gaining more control over your work and processes. It also means your players are far more likely to actually roll credits—letting you more effectively compete for their limited time in an increasingly saturated market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," he explains. "That meant being okay with the game being 12 hours, but if it had been eight hours—and the eight hours were fantastic—we would have settled for that to reach consistent quality."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet acknowledges concerns over game size can be a "difficult bias" to overcome and admits the prospect of developing a smaller title initially sparked discussions in Team Asobi HQ. Eventually, however, the team realized they could use the benefits of thinking small and compact to maintain a clear scope and rapidly execute on unique concepts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a decision that was justified by the fact that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was built in just three and a half years—only six months more than the team initially envisioned. Budget was maintained by choosing to adjust the pitch of the studio's ramp-up curve to accommodate fewer developers over a longer period of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that mantra of 'simplicity' in mind, Team Asobi became adept at distilling ideas down to their core throughout production. For instance, although the DualSense controller has 18 buttons, the team forced themselves to utilize as few inputs as possible—relying on short and long presses and contextual controls to bridge the complexity gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio also simplified some of Astro's abilities. For example, they removed a third medium-sized Astro Bot from the (utterly fantastic) level that sees the titular hero turn into a sponge to absorb water and grow in size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Initially we let players] select three sizes of sponge: small, medium, and large," says Doucet. "At first it was fine but then you forget and think 'am I small? Am I medium? Am I large?' It became too complicated so we went for a system that fluctuates between big and small. Once again, this is bias, as game designers we always think that more is better, but it's not the case."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi sought to remove similar complications from its hero characters, such as the bot versions of Aloy and Kratos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Aloy, the studio ensured slow-motion triggered automatically whenever players target an enemy with her bow and arrow. In Horizon, that effect had to be triggered manually. For Kratos, players need only press one button to hurl and recall his thudding axe. Again, that's different from God of War, which requires different button inputs to achieve the same outcome.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet says those tweaks were made in service of simplicity and with an implicit understanding that Astro Bot was targeting a different audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That pursuit of 'less is more' extended to other, perhaps more surprising, areas of production. Doucet explains it pushed the studio to tell a story "with a minimum amount of text and no voice over." He reveals Astro Bot features less than 5000 words—or 4.292 words to be exact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also only 12 minutes and 30 seconds of cutscenes in the entire experience, meaning players are 'active' roughly 98.3 percent of the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a metric that speaks to the team's belief in creating an buoyant toybox&nbsp;by reducing distractions to champion perpetual participation. There were other benefits, too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It kind of struck me in development, but all of these efforts towards simplicity, they've actually made the game easier to share," muses Doucet. "For example, the fact there is no skill tree—while individual powers are one-shot—means that we introduce a new mechanic all the time. That means you could have friends coming to your house, picking up the game halfway through your campaign, playing for the first time, and still having a normal experience. That becomes really powerful when we think about spreading to new audiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Doucet feels actively pursuing simplicity is often viewed as criminally uncool in the world of sprawling blockbusters—but perhaps that just means those developers capable of squashing that particular insecurity will reap the biggest rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in second league, rather than a bad spot in the top league," he explains. "Instead of joining the cool trendy party on a crowded beach with bars and celebrities, how about you just look for a little quiet beach and have a cool picnic over there?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the choices we made with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be labelled double-A or maybe lacking in ambition—like the size of the team, the size of the game, the fact there's no text, no voice, and its not an open world. But that doesn't really matter. We still made a game that made people really happy, and in fact it was probably the simplicity that a lot of players made time for."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
