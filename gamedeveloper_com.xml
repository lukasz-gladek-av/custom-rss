Skal noted the ongoing struggles with live-service and ongoing games trying to vie for players' time when they already have "forever games" set in stone. Cooldown-published titles, he reasoned, can serve as good in-between games instead of titles that "ask more of us than we can give."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To that end, Gibson said games from interested developers have to fit in at least two of its three categories: reliability, like an established studio or a remaster for a well-known game; the potential to be a "next big hit;" or a project that teaches Cooldown something or "helps strengthen our relationship with one of the platforms."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our team is confident rational business models will be a long-term strength of Cooldown Games and that just might be a refreshing contrast from many recent industry trends," said Gibson in the company announcement. "My passion of helping game makers reach as many game players as possible while making sure that it’s a rewarding experience for everyone involved is at the center of all of this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers interested in working with Cooldown can contact the studio </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cooldowngames.com/contact/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and those looking for a job can apply </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cooldowngames.com/careers/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
