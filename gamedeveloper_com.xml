The Japanese company acquired Bungie in 2023 and said it would remain relatively independent. Now, however, Sony CFO Lin Tao has indicated those days are over. "We have gone through structural reform [with Bungie], as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding." As for Marathon, the shooter is slated to launch during the fiscal year ending Match 2026.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-cfo-tells-investors-bungie-s-independence-is-getting-lighter-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony CFO tells investors Bungie's independence is 'getting lighter'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The PlayStation 5 has topped 80 million lifetime sales"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-playstation-5-has-topped-80-million-lifetime-sales">The PlayStation 5 has topped 80 million lifetime sales</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The PlayStation 5 has squeaked past 80 million lifetime sales after Sony bundled another 2.5 million consoles out of the door during Q1. The current-generation console has now sold exactly 80.3 million units in around five years. It's a pretty hefty number but still well behind the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 4, which sold over 117 million units worldwide.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo raises price of Switch hardware and Switch 2 accessories in the U.S."><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-raises-price-of-switch-hardware-and-switch-2-accessories-in-the-u-s-">Nintendo raises price of Switch hardware and Switch 2 accessories in the U.S.</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump look to be having an impact—just not in a way that's benefiting consumers in the country. Earlier this week, Nintendo increased the price of hardware that's about to celebrate a decade on shelves due to shifting market condition in the United States. Although the Japanese company didn't mention tariffs specifically, the latest levies imposed by Trump included a 20 percent tariff on Vietnam—one of Nintendo's major production hubs. Another masterstroke from Donald.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/duolingo-acquires-music-game-specialists-to-make-education-more-engaging-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Duolingo acquires music game specialists to make education 'more engaging'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A clever game about flies and brief lives encounters the limits of statistics"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/time-flies-life-expectancy-switzerland-palestine">A clever game about flies and brief lives encounters the limits of statistics</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game File //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Time Flies, a fascinating little puzzler about our fleeting time on this planet, launched at the end of July and is a morsel we think should be on everybody's radar. The title enables players to tweak their difficulty settings by choosing a country of origin for their fly. The longer that country's average life expectancy, the more time you'll have to buzz around checking tasks of your bucket list. It's a compelling if somewhat morbid approach—and one that might require frequent updates in order to accurately reflect the current state of the world.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ziff Davis lays off IGN staff after months-long acquisition spree"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-lays-off-staff-affecting-12-percent-of-the-union-s-bargaining-unit">Ziff Davis lays off IGN staff after months-long acquisition spree</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">IGN parent company Ziff Davis just posted its "strongest quarterly revenue growth since 2021," with gaming and entertainment revenue increasing by 7.5 percent year-over-year. Huzzah! Bonuses and champagne for everyone! In another reality, maybe. In this timeline, the conglomate instead chose to make eight members of the IGN team redundant, including some members of the IGN Union. 23 people were laid off across the board. Oh, those cuts also come after a massive acquisition drive. Go figure.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastercard Denies Pressuring Steam To Censor ‘NSFW’ Games (but Valve pushes back)"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Mastercard Denies Pressuring Steam To Censor ‘NSFW’ Games (but Valve pushes back)</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Kotaku //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Payment provider Mastercard has been catching flack for seemingly forcing Valve and Itch to curb the sale of adult and NSFW content on their platforms. The company was accused of pressuring both to adapt their policies at the behest of a anti-porn movement called Collective Shout. Confusion and anger understandably ensued. Mastercard eventually commented on the matter and said it hasn't imposted restrictions "of any activity on game creator sites and platforms" and all was forgiven. Wait, scratch that last part. Valve quickly cast doubt on those claims in a statement to Kotaku and explained that while Mastercard did not communicate with it directly, the company did express concerns "through payment processor and banking intermediaries." Feud reignited.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'We fought hard:' Raven QA union secures contract after three years of bargaining"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-fought-hard-raven-qa-union-secures-contract-after-three-years-of-bargaining">'We fought hard:' Raven QA union secures contract after three years of bargaining</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Amid mass layoffs at Microsoft, a handful of QA workers within the company's Raven Software subsidiary scored a massive victory this week after securing their first union contract. 19 members of the Game Workers Alliance-CWA ratified a contract after three years of bargaining, securing wage increases, crunch and layoff protections, expanded disability accommodations, and more. "Going from organizing to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there,” said Autumn Prazuch, QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path."
