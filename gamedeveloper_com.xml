But economic shifts in the industry seemed to drive the company to surface at the 2025 Game Developers Conference.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the event, Havok announced a new pricing model for developers working on budgets under $20 million. The company's normally high-end offerings haven't been affordable for many developers, and while they aren't ready to support low budget indies just yet, general manager David Cochrane told Game Developer that the company now wants to work with studios with "tens" of employees, not necessarily "hundreds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers on those lower budgets can now license tools like Havok Physics and Havok Navigation for the low low price of $50,000 per Havok product. There's no royalty fee, and studios can also use plug-in versions of the tools for Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/how-avowed-s-qa-team-stomped-out-bugs-by-working-inside-the-design-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Avowed's QA team stomped out bugs by working inside the design tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To see a company known for selling premium tools for big-budget games open up to the lower-tier market is quite a phenomenon—especially in an era where the biggest hits of 2025 include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RuneScape Dragonwilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Small games are becoming bigger hits—and to hear Cochrane tell it, Havok seems to be following the trend.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Havok is the rare middleware company to last 25 years">Havok is the rare middleware company to last 25 years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cochrane explained to Game Developer that Havok began planning the new pricing scheme after studying how many mid-sized studios were planning more ambitious games using Unreal Engine. Havok is a "good fit" for Unreal he said, and to see developers embracing the kinds of solutions Havok offers—but not being able to afford its offerings—began to shift their thinking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the kind of adaptation Havok has made repeatedly over the last 25 years, following what Cochrane described as the "creativity" of developers. But it's not the kind of creativity you might think of at first glance. Cochrane praised the gameplay advancements and new kinds of ideas that emerged from the last two-and-a-half decades, but the company's primary focus has been the creativity of technical problem-solving the industry has produced. "The industry has always found creative ways to deliver games that make the most of the of their chosen platform," he said, alluding to the ways developers adapt to online networking or "diversity of hardware." Most recently, he said Havok has paid close attention to the rise of powerful handheld devices like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck—and how developers are making "new kinds of games" suited for those devices.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But not every trend Havok's been around for has stuck. He recalled the rise of early Facebook games around 2009-2012. If that trend had stayed around, Havok would have been in a tough spot since Facebook games don't need expensive physics or cloth simulation technology. "There was almost a sense of 'was the whole industry gonna have to pivot hard toward this?'" he recalled.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't. "There can be a new style of game that comes along—whether that's a live service, or whether it's a social game, or whatever—when MAU numbers are high, the whole industry will take notice, but the game industry always tends to drift back toward an equilibrium which involves many different types of games across many different platforms."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So even with the surge of fast-followers for UGC games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—few of which need Havok's high-end physics and cloth technology—Cochrane said there will still be an audience for games gushing with plentiful particles.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well" target="_self" data-discover="true">The scratch coding and sharp constraints at the heart of Animal Well</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The next space for innovation: AI navigation">The next space for innovation: AI navigation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like everyone else at GDC, Cochrane had a lot to say about AI—but not the same kind of AI that had everyone else aflutter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cochrane explained that Havok's most overlooked product its its AI navigation tech—but it's also one the most quietly groundbreaking pieces in the company's portfolio. "What we're really seeing now is an increased diversity in the the scale of different characters that [players] come across in a game," he said. Games have had enormous enemies for years, but newer pathfinding tech allows gigantic creatures to share space with smaller in-game characters instead of having their own dedicated areas.</span></p><p>Image via Havok.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He referenced FromSoftware's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> here, a game where players can be fighting twisted knights in ruins one minute, then be ambushed by a dragon the next, often in the same area.

"The reality is...the sizes of worlds that people are dealing with at the moment are stressing some of the historic techniques that would have been used to build [methods] for navigation," he said. "Some of the things we're doing is showing ways in which we can have very memory-efficient representations for navigation. We can allow characters to navigate across large worlds that might include streamed geometry in and out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now you won't actually hold the whole game world in memory at one point in time, but you still want NPCs that can actually navigate naturally through those larger environments. That's an area we're investing a lot in."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa Tech.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
