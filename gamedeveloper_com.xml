It quickly branched out into publishing, and founder Jamin Smith hopes the cash injection will allow the company to take more risks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our new shareholders are invested in our mission to take indie publishing in a different direction. Looking at the indie landscape, it's no surprise investors are cautious of publishers. It's a crowded market, and risk is baked into the model. Back the wrong horses and you're stuffed," said Smith.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I wanted to put risk front and centre of our philosophy in an increasingly risk-shy industry. Actively seeking bolder work, and developers taking more significant creative swings."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pre-seed has seen Pantaloon secure backing from veterans such as Markus Wilding (ex-Private Division, 2K), Fernando Rizo and Alastair Hebson (Caboodle Games), Benjamin Lavery (Trailer Farm) and Steven Yau (ex-King, Playfish).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-sold-a-record-number-of-video-games-over-the-past-nine-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Capcom sold a record number of video games over the past nine months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also cements a partnership between Pantaloon and backend technology platform LootLocker. Both companies will now work together to develop a bespoke publishing platform capable of powering direct-to-consumer initiatives.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
