Humanity might be on the ropes, but in the towering stronghold of The Belfry they have created a beacon of salvation that casts rays of hope across a ruined land.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is seared into the gameplay itself, with Stoic asking players to lean on their companions and fight for a brighter future by working together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grammy-nominated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> composer Austin Wintory, who previously worked with Stoic to piece together the score for The Banner Saga, sought to mirror that sense of optimism and joyousness in the game's soundscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking about his process to Game Developer earlier this year, Wintory explained he strove to craft a score that refused to veer into nihilism or cynicism. Yes, there is darkness—but never without light. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ernie Jorgensen told Wintory he wanted the title to reflect the sort of emotional qualities you often find in Pixar or Disney movies. The veteran composer did his best to oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [request] felt really novel because lots of games are all too excited to lean into the gritty side of things, not least of which our previous collaboration, The Banner Saga trilogy! Those games were super heavy, and so I think part of it was also just a reaction to that," explained Wintory.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/digging-into-sag-aftra-s-stellar-win-with-sarah-elmaleh-game-developer-podcast-ep-51" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into SAG-AFTRA’s Stellar Win With Sarah Elmaleh - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 51</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"How that manifested musically was a few different things but above all, the music is very very melodic. Big, old fashioned, almost 19th century-style Romantic melodies in a great big orchestral palette. In a world where so many games (including many of my own!) put tons of emphasis on mood and texture, leaning so hard into a bygone tradition gave it that optimistic quality. I think part of why that works, and maybe I'm simply being sentimental here, is that those traditions are really powerful and special, and it felt like we were doing our part to ensure their preservation."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wintory, preservation is itself an act of hope. "To say 'these things that were plentiful before actually mattered, and are worth saving,' that feels like an intrinsically optimistic thing to do," he added. "That's my own projection at least."&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBPHKPDIscw?si=b3bWIWbnXkcxwExm" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, Wintory admitted he initially felt as if he was "betraying" his own creative process by leaning on old fashioned techniques instead of taking wild swings. He said he strives to be as "radical as possible" within the parameters of each project, but this time around had to coax out his nostalgic side.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA members ratify new interactive media contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of that process, he sought to ensure individual musicians received their time in the limelight. Highlighting musicianship has always been a fundamental part of his approach, but it became even more central with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, the cello performances of Tina Guo in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were extremely significant to me. I wanted to make sure players don't just hear a 'cello' in some abstract way, but that they feel and hear her. Her choices, her subjective touches. Every project I've worked on except for the very, very tiny number of ones that were truly 100 percent electronic (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>flOw</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my first ever game), this has been important. But with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there aren't really any tricks beyond that. It's the entire focus," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On top of that, our interactive combat system is built around an idea of really feeling the orchestra up-shift and down-shift in energy. Without feeling those changes in the actual performances themselves, and the way they made the air vibrate, the whole thing wouldn't come off. I wanted to make sure you could feel this amazing 70-piece orchestra pivot from playing very loud to very soft. The actual decibels on the recording are nearly the same, but the emotional impacts are so distinct from each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-urges-more-non-struck-game-studios-to-sign-interim-agreement" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA urges more non-struck game studios to sign interim agreement</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those performances were captured in Wintory's backyard of Los Angeles at the legendary Warner Bros scoring stage. The seasoned maestro said it's one of only a handful of video game projects to have been recorded in the city in the past 15 years—joining the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that very exclusive club. It has been 12 years since Wintory himself recorded there and it was a homecoming that felt long overdue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I was about 14 years old I saw a documentary about the composer Jerry Goldsmith, my all-time favorite, and in it we see a lot of footage of him conducting the recordings from the 1994 thriller </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The River Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And something I always loved was that he wouldn't say "French Horns, at bar 20 can you be louder?" He would say "Jim, a bit louder at bar 20." Or "Mike, let's try something else at the end here," talking to pianist Mike Lang," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The orchestra were his peers, even his friends. Almost like being in a band. And that was a huge motivation for me wanting to pursue music and composing, and also to live specifically in LA. A town where seemingly everyone is creative and you constantly go into a studio together to make art. What a dream!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Sadly, it's proven to not be the case in terms of recording games. I've been lucky to do a handful of movies and other things here over the years, but 99 percent of my game recording has been in cities like London, Nashville, Vienna and Skopje (Macedonia). And don't get me wrong, I've traveled to all those cities and built some amazing friendships and wonderful memories. But being the sentimental type that I am, it's never quite the same as recording in your home, with sort of 'chosen family.' These musicians here are so much a part of my social life, but so rarely my professional one. So it was a massively cathartic and wonderful experience to finally rectify that."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
