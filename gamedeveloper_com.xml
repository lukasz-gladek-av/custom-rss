That said, it also acknowledged that not everybody will be keen on working with an AI company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI companies, like&nbsp;Ethovox, that agree with our union's AI guidelines. Not everyone will want to work with an AI company, and that's understandable. But for those who intend to utilize the opportunities AI offers, it's important that agreements require companies to secure informed consent, and provide fair compensation," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without informed consent and fair compensation, this new era will become a 'Wild West' of AI misuse and exploitation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ethovox was co-founded by voice actor Cissy Jones and voice director Julian Kwasneski. The company purports to be the "only premium voice service created by actors and empowered by AI," and says it aims to build the world's first "fully-authenticated, properly licensed foundational voice model."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones claims actors working with Ethovox have complete control over how their digital replicas are deployed, and emphasized that anybody working with the company will be properly compensated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ethovox&nbsp;is the only voice AI company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice A.I. model that prioritizes the interests of voice actors," added Jones in a press release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A.I. should be a choice. For that reason, we have reached out to the voice actor community throughout this process.&nbsp;Ethovox&nbsp;will continue to do so as we demonstrate that artists can, and should, be compensated for contributing to ethical A.I. development while also maintaining consent and control over their voice data."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA recently announced that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sag-aftra-strike-will-continue-after-union-concludes-latest-talks-with-major-game-studios">negotiations with Interactive Media Agreement employers will continue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after concluding its latest round of talks.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
