While this messaging reaffirms a shift in Microsoft’s strategy to attract Xbox users off-console, questions are raised over Microsoft’s readiness in the cloud, mobile, PC, and handheld segments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Console contraction drives subscriptions saturation">Console contraction drives subscriptions saturation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over ten years ago, Microsoft launched Xbox One, a singular device to drive Xbox’s ecosystem of games, software and services.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fast forward to today, and Microsoft’s new “This is an Xbox” campaign attempts to raise consumer awareness that smartphones, laptops, TVs, handhelds, streaming sticks, and VR headsets are also Xboxes, de-emphasizing the console as the center of the Xbox ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand how we got to this point, consider the following:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Xbox has endured two generations of console decline. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">As Xbox Series X/S ends its fifth calendar year on the market, Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om006587/games-hardware-database">Games Hardware Database</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> estimates that its installed base will fall short of its Xbox One predecessor by 5m units (see Figure 1).

Add on top of this the decision to acquire significant content that is simply too costly to make exclusive to Xbox consoles and Microsoft has been forced into a position where it must look beyond its console audience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xbox is not ready to be unshackled from its console core">Xbox is not ready to be unshackled from its console core</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PCs are among the devices Microsoft is calling Xboxes, and it is here where Microsoft has the most potential to reach new players, as PC Game Pass offers access to high value first-party content such as 2024’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Subscriptions and Cloud Gaming Market Forecast </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">estimates subscriptions to PC Game Pass at the end of 2024 will stand at under a sixth of all Game Pass tiers combined, so the platform represents plenty of potential for Microsoft to exploit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet Microsoft remains in close competition with incumbent player Valve, whose Steam distribution platform is synonymous with PC gaming. While some major publishers such as Sega and Square Enix have begun publishing their Xbox console games on Microsoft’s PC storefront day-and-date, many remain content with Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia analysis of annual Xbox console game launches reveals that the bulk of titles continue to launch without an accompanying Xbox PC release via the Microsoft Store, as indicated by the lack of “Play Anywhere” support (see Figure 2).</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Figure 2: Xbox console software continues to lack PC versions via Microsoft Store at launch">Figure 2: Xbox console software continues to lack PC versions via Microsoft Store at launch</h4><p>Source: Microsoft, Omdia</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On mobile, Microsoft has also been keen to highlight smartphones as “an Xbox that makes calls”, yet the launch of an Xbox mobile store on Android is now off the table for 2024. This has left it without a means of directly engaging with its audience, standing in contrast with Epic Games, which has begun doing so with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its recently launched Epic Games for Mobile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC gaming handhelds are another device that Microsoft also highlights as Xboxes. But the user experience is far from perfect – Windows 11’s poor user suitability for handhelds continues to hold back partnering PC manufacturers.

Yet cloud streaming also presents several hurdles:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Xbox Cloud Gaming continues to require the top tier Game Pass Ultimate subscription</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, making it a hard sell to anyone who doesn’t already own an Xbox console or gaming-capable PC. An ad-supported tier of Game Pass with a limited selection of games has yet to materialize.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Microsoft cannot guarantee a console-quality experience via cloud streaming. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">While</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Xbox console hardware is used in data centers to stream games to players, the resulting quality and latency of streamed gameplay depends on several factors outside Microsoft’s control. These include the location of Microsoft’s servers, the quality and type of connection, and the video codec used.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Additional friction remains. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Games designed for large, 4K TVs aren’t guaranteed to look or play their best streamed to a small phone screen without a physical controller, which the audience off-console may not already own.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The full Xbox games library remains unavailable for streaming.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This creates a mismatch of expectations, especially for lapsed or long-time Xbox console players who have invested in physical and digital console games that persist in the console library today.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Microsoft’s reach to customers on iPhones and iPads remains limited. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Xbox Cloud Gaming continues to be unavailable on the iOS App Store. Apple’s core technology fee presents a tax on iOS users’ engagement that Microsoft has deemed not worth paying.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Put simply, the Xbox ecosystem off-console is not yet ready to shoulder Microsoft’s ambitions to truly grow off-console. On mobile, Microsoft lacks a distribution platform to build up long-term engagement with new customers. And while PC Game Pass shows the most promise, the lack of third-party support for the Microsoft Store re-affirms Steam’s dominance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While cloud offers the most reach, it continues to present the same challenges to both Microsoft and consumers – many of the same challenges which hampered uptake at the beginning of Xbox Series X/S’s console cycle. In 4Q24, “This is an Xbox” ultimately presents a vision of where Microsoft would like Xbox to be, rather than where it is today.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.
