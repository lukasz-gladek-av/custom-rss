            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-they-weren-t-very-good-to-use-panic-halts-development-of-playdate-stereo-dock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Playdate Stereo Dock has been consigned to the realm of dreams (for now) with Panic struggling to realize its vision for the audio accessory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://play.date/stereo-dock/">In an update shared on the Playdate website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Panic said it hopes the Stereo Dock will still launch "someday" but noted its current production plans have been placed on hold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said that birthing the dock had become "almost more challenging than making the Playdate itself," and explained that fraught partnerships and spiralling development costs have left the current iteration of the project dead in the water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What happened? Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time—a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers—could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to another company in another country," wrote Panic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often–rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn't sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic eventually took over the audio production process and hand-tuned the speaker's EQ curves to bolster its output. It also negotiated a buyout of the bluetooth chipset source code with a view to taking over development and improving the user experience, only to be met with some "gnarly code" that made life even more difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kept pushing forward. We got a number of beautiful finished prototypes, in beautiful final packaging, that look incredible on our desks. But they weren’t very good to use. And if we’re going to ship a product, it has to be, at least, good," continued Panic. "Eventually we hit that painful line: we’re spending more to make this product than we are likely to ever make back from it. And so, we hit pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company still hopes it will have the time and resources to reboot the project in the future, but for now remains focused on Playdate itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-devs-have-earned-over-500-000-through-catalog">sold over 70,000 units of Playdate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since launching the console in 2022, although it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-launch-delayed-until-early-2022-">encountered plenty of challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> along the way. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-launches-catalog-a-curated-digital-storefront-for-playdate">It also launched Catalog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bona fide storefront for Playdate developers and players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-recovers-stolen-playdates-worth-400-000-after-lots-of-detective-work-">retrieved around $400,000 worth of Playdate stock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that vanished in Las Vegas in rather suspicious circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

That said, it also acknowledged that not everybody will be keen on working with an AI company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI companies, like&nbsp;Ethovox, that agree with our union's AI guidelines. Not everyone will want to work with an AI company, and that's understandable. But for those who intend to utilize the opportunities AI offers, it's important that agreements require companies to secure informed consent, and provide fair compensation," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without informed consent and fair compensation, this new era will become a 'Wild West' of AI misuse and exploitation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ethovox was co-founded by voice actor Cissy Jones and voice director Julian Kwasneski. The company purports to be the "only premium voice service created by actors and empowered by AI," and says it aims to build the world's first "fully-authenticated, properly licensed foundational voice model."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones claims actors working with Ethovox have complete control over how their digital replicas are deployed, and emphasized that anybody working with the company will be properly compensated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ethovox&nbsp;is the only voice AI company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice A.I. model that prioritizes the interests of voice actors," added Jones in a press release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A.I. should be a choice. For that reason, we have reached out to the voice actor community throughout this process.&nbsp;Ethovox&nbsp;will continue to do so as we demonstrate that artists can, and should, be compensated for contributing to ethical A.I. development while also maintaining consent and control over their voice data."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA recently announced that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sag-aftra-strike-will-continue-after-union-concludes-latest-talks-with-major-game-studios">negotiations with Interactive Media Agreement employers will continue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after concluding its latest round of talks.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
