The initial release period garnered 200,000 concurrent players. Yet, the company, which both developed and published the title, has been unable to maintain that initial user base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Tokyo Game Show, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Descendant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Min Seok Joo and producer Beom-Jun Lee shared insights about the challenges of balancing a live service game, and dealing with feedback from completely opposite corners of the player base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Continuing with the example of an overpowered Descendant, in cases like this, Lee said there's usually feedback from two main groups of users. Some would argue the team needs to reduce the power, while the other would argue otherwise and ask to maintain the current status. The trick is figuring out how to deal with these two contending groups.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-capcom-designed-resident-evil-requiem-with-different-camera-angles-in-mind" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Capcom designed Resident Evil Requiem with different camera angles in mind</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“In reality, we can't downpower the Descendant, [as] that will do a very big damage to the game, because the users who do not like this will leave, so we can't do that,” he said. “So in order to meet the needs of both groups, we have to improve the power of the other Descendants. In order to improve the power of all the other Descendants, that takes more time and energy than planned.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lee added that players generally want to progress faster, and the team is constantly listening to their “needs and wants” to try and incorporate their feedback. But once they receive said feedback, they have to digest it before incorporating it, which takes additional time. All the while, the team also needs to consider the greater scheme of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Joo called this a “wave” that can push the team to unplanned directions. “All this feedback, it all comes together, and then it kind of gives us the pressure to move towards a certain direction that we hadn't intended in the beginning,” he said. “So that changes our plan, and in order to make that kind of change, we have to adjust our schedule and we have to change our priority. So I think that is the difficult part about live service games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation">Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite all of this, Joo said the team doesn't have a hard and fast rule about deciding on changes based on feedback. Sometimes it can be an idea or concern from one person, but one that could be quite meaningful. Other times, a large number of players could be demanding the same thing—even if the team didn't initially plan to make that change, these cases can make them reconsider it.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cycling-through-the-open-world-design-of-wheel-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cycling through the open-world design of Wheel World</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside looking at and digesting data, the team also leans on its intuition to decide where to put more emphasis. Balancing these two elements is key to try to maintain the original direction of the game and not steer away from the developers' intentions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I think the gist of live service games is you have to serve two different groups in a parallel manner,” Joo said. “In other words, the existing users, we need to provide them with the new things that they can play with, so they will be the backbone. And then we also need to bring in the new players who can catch up very quickly so they can join the existing players. Between these two, we can't say that one is more important than the other. It has to go hand in hand.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that the operation of a free-to-play live service game is “very difficult,” with the biggest thing being that the team's intentions and the actual results don't match sometimes, receiving feedback that pushes things in a completely different direction. “It was actually quite stressful on our side, and I think that is the most difficult part about a free-to-play game.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Yes, and while we provide the live service, we're actually preparing for future updates at the same time,” Lee said. “But when we are having this live service, we get live feedback, and so we try to deal with things that we haven't really expected. But at the same time, we need to prepare for the future as well. So it's very difficult for us to allocate the resources.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
