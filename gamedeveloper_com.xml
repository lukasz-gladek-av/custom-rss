In response, 2K said it respected the rights of workers seeking a vote but suggested unionization wasn't the best way forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know the needs of our workforce are diverse, and that our industry faces new challenges as we continue to evolve and grow," said a company spokesperson at the time. "We feel that we are best served addressing these challenges and changing needs together through our existing feedback channels rather than through a union."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb claimed the formation of the 2K MoCap Union is a historic milestone that proves "collective action is the best way to secure fairness, equity, and respect in the workplace."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Their courage will inspire others in the industry to follow suit. This outcome also demonstrates what can be achieved when workers exercise their right to organize, a right that we will continue to fight to defend and expand," added Loeb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union will now begin negotiations with 2K management to secure a contract&nbsp; that "reflects their contributions to the company's success."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan Kwok, a motion capture tools engineer at the studio, said the union will be seeking "positive change" in the face of widespread layoffs and the rise of generative AI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I felt inspired to see so many of us rally together to equip ourselves with the means to create positive change at our studio. The state of the industry is severe. Why must workers take the fall when corporations overextend and collapse? On top of that, AI stands to dramatically change the way games will be created if protections for human creatives are not secured in the present," said Kwok.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I’m optimistic that Take-Two will recognize that we are investing in this studio, just as they have. We hope to bargain in good faith to make this studio’s processes more transparent, democratic, and equitable for all of us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A huge number of workers at major companies including Microsoft, Embracer, and Sega have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/-trend-unionization">unionized in recent years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the hopes of securing better working conditions in a volatile industry.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
