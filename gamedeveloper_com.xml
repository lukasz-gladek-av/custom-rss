In the 11 years since she wrote that post, Liz has evolved from being a game designer to design director, and her perspective on “The Door Problem” has shifted.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today she’s not thinking as much about doors—more about how to help other designers pitch and build doors that fit the scope and vision for their game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does good leadership look like in game design?">What does good leadership look like in game design?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">England said she didn’t think there was any more to be added to “The Door Problem” even after 11 years. She’s been thinking more about how game design leadership can help developers solve their own “door problems” to make games in a more effective manner. That's not only meant improving her language for designing game design challenges—but looking back at leaders she looked up to earlier in her career.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/has-tides-of-tomorrow-cracked-the-narrative-multiplayer-formula-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Has Tides of Tomorrow cracked the narrative multiplayer formula?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About The Game Developer Podcast">About The Game Developer Podcast</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Developer podcast is a bi-weekly podcast chronicling the triumphs, catastrophes, and everything in-between of game development, sharing lessons and strategies fellow developers can use to hone their craft.
