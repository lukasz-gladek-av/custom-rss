As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive," said Remedy CEO, Tero Virtala.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Thus far, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak’s</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Virtala said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was designed to evolve over time and believes the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spin-off can become successful despite a "rocky launch."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lineage-developer-ncsoft-establishes-casual-mobile-division" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lineage developer NCSoft establishes AI-driven casual mobile division</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive—showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining," he added. "We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will receive a large major update in late September that Remedy feels will be the "next key step" in evolving the title and engaging players. Virtala said the company remains committed to engaging with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community and expanding the game.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Control 2 exceeds 5 million lifetime sales during Q2">Control 2 exceeds 5 million lifetime sales during Q2</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the second quarter of the fiscal year, Remedy saw revenue increase by 63.5 percent year-on-year to €16.9 million ($19.6 million).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game sales and royalties both increased, while development costs also rose. The company posted a quarterly operating loss of €500,000 ($581,000), which was an improvement on the €2.7 million ($3.1 million) operating loss posted this time last year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Game sales increase was driven by the sales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including an initial accrual from subscription service agreements with Sony and Microsoft. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> continued to sell steadily and accrue royalties.

The title's publishing, marketing, and distribution rights recently transferred back to Remedy and the company said it has been successful in driving sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also continues to "sell steadily and accrue royalties." Remedy said the wider Alan Wake franchise is selling in line with expectations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing the company's wider business prospects, Virtala said Remedy is delivering on its core strategic pillars with an emphasis on self-publishing and has already gained "valuable experience" in that specific arena.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"During the second quarter, over half of Remedy’s revenue was recognized from game sales and royalties in comparison to development fees, which represented a lesser share of the revenue. This marks Remedy's progressive transition to the self-publishing model. We will keep executing our strategy to reach the communicated targets for 2027," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tron-catalyst-developer-bithell-games-makes-majority-of-full-time-employees-redundant" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tron Catalyst developer Bithell Games makes majority of full time employees redundant</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have two established own franchises, Control and Alan Wake, which are linked through the Remedy Connected Universe.
