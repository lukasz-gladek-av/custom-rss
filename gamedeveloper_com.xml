Search the latter, and you'll find a mix of 2042 clips from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 2042</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and chatter about the upcoming game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A years-after-launch burst of player enthusiasm would be a win for almost any game developer.

It can't swing into action in response to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s popularity because it is heads-down on the next Battlefield game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/battlefield-studios-unites-ea-s-internal-teams-to-reinvigorate-shooter-series">working with a number of other EA subsidiaries to relaunch the series</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a live service powerhouse (Ars Technica </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">has reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that said project is going through a rocky patch in development). If everyone's heads down on Battlefield, there's no one to double back on Battlefront.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making new content would also be technically difficult because it ended development 5 years ago. Not only would the tooling be out of date, but there may be serious tech debt and flaws in shipping on modern consoles. Making new Star Wars content also might require EA to renegotiate its license with copyright holder Disney. That doesn't seem likely, given that CEO Andrew Wilson has repeatedly stated the company is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-shutters-battlefield-dev-ridgeline-games-torches-respawn-s-unannounced-star-wars-shooter">moving away from licensed games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-13-trump-s-video-game-funding-cuts-laid-bare-and-krafton-reportedly-screws-over-the-subnautica-2-dev-team" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #13: Trump's video game funding cuts laid bare and Krafton's wild public feud with Subnautica developers</a></p><p>Image via EA/DICE.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That just leaves the question of a hypothetical sequel. GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless doesn't think this player surge is enough to sway EA on making another Star Wars Battlefront game. Based on his company's data, he estimated that the game has earned "about $5 million" in gross revenue since May 1st, out of a total of "around $32 million" for its entire lifetime on Steam (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only launched on Steam in 2020. It had previously been available on EA's Origin app).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While it's true that its concurrent users are now giant, it's all via one-off purchases," said Carless. "We'd imagine that EA sees this as good catalogue revenue, but may or may not see it as a reason to make a new game in the series." A new game would likely cost at least $60, and players who bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for a few dollars might blink at an expensive successor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those are the realities of game development in 2025. But thanks to reporting and statements from former developers, we can see how EA failed to adapt to the shifting environment of online games, all because it was laser-focused on financial growth at all cost.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Battlefront II's"><span>Battlefront II's</span> monetization scheme was originally a disaster</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That laser focus on profits-at-all-costs was on display when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> first launched in 2017. The $60 game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/ea-tweaks-i-star-wars-battlefront-ii-i-s-loot-box-drops-following-beta-feedback">loot box monetization system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was so unpopular that EA </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-battlefront-ii-i-devs-cut-cost-of-in-game-unlocks-75-in-response-to-fan-outcry">slashed prices by 75 percent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Shortly afterward, then-Hawaii state legislature representative Chris Lee called for legislation banning loot boxes, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hawaiian-representative-wants-to-clamp-down-on-predatory-loot-boxes">referring to </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hawaiian-representative-wants-to-clamp-down-on-predatory-loot-boxes">Battlefront II</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a "Star Wars-themed online casino." Even if you don't subscribe to the theory that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/austrian-court-finds-fifa-s-in-game-card-packs-violate-gambling-laws">loot boxes are a form of gambling</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's fair to say charging extra cash (or demanding 40 hours of in-game playtime) to unlock characters from the films was a stretch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having to alter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s monetization model would have impacted EA's projected revenue for the game, potentially reducing the company's enthusiasm for not only the game, but the Star Wars license as a whole.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fiasco had been a long-distant memory by the time DICE and EA ended post-launch content development in 2020. Ending development while keeping the game's official servers online fit DICE's decades-long business strategy. Since 2011's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the series has been sold as a premium product with about two years of post-launch content support that could expand post-launch sales. DICE also employed this model for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Battlefront</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This left EA vulnerable to disruption by companies who could deliver a similar quality level without developing expensive sequels. The same year that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> provoked legislative furor, Bluehole released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Playerunknown's Battlegrounds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (today known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Battlegrounds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), upending the financial model for live service games. Bluehole had plenty of experience making massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which aren't designed around an inevitable sunsetting to tee up a bigger-budget sequel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem is clear: for the last decade EA has choked out opportunities for flexibility and surprise hits. Reporting on EA—from its mandate that BioWare to convert its in-development Dragon Age sequel into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reportedly-doomed-by-late-pivot-from-live-service">an online multiplayer game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/devs-recall-moments-of-instability-indecision-and-crunch-on-i-anthem-i-">troubled development cycle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to the next Battlefield game has shown a repeating pattern: EA tasking teams not experienced in specific genres with making blockbuster do-or-die games with little plan for long-term support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This problem is made obvious by the studios not forced exclusively into these meat grinders. EA Motive turned out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Squadrons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with just three years between them while also juggling support on projects </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired">like</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the next Battlefield single-player campaign. (And </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s single-player campaign!) Its in-development Iron Man Game seems safe for the moment, but CEO Andrew Wilson's repeated insistence that the company is moving away from licensed games (and the company's cancelling of a Black Panther game and shutting down developer Cliffhanger Games) place an ever-increasing amount of pressure on that game to do well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BioWare Austin kept </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: The Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> humming along (even if it never hitting the highs of other MMORPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), building a deep knowledge base for live services and online games the studio could have tapped into.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> B</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">ut then EA </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bioware-to-offload-i-star-wars-the-old-republic-i-to-refocus-on-single-player-games">moved development of that game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to external studio Broadsword.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Wilson recently noted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legend's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> revenue is "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-dragon-age-underperformance-justifies-decision-to-prioritize-highest-potential-opportunities-">declining</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">", while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Battlegrounds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> continue to hum along. "We do believe there will be a time where we need to do a more meaningful update of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a broad game experience," he said—but only saying that would take place after the launch of the next Battlefield game. That "update" will be harder to make given how many </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-allegedly-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers-after-canceling-more-games-at-respawn-entertainment">developers at Respawn Entertainment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the company's laid off this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA's entire business model has calcified—purely pursuing new big budget megahits in an era where yesterday's big budget megahits are still topping the charts.
