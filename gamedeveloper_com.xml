"Nintendo's subsidized hardware pricing, which extends even to peripherals, puts Switch 2 at a significant pricing advantage over PS5 and even the entry-level LCD Steam Deck model," he said in a statement to Game Developer. He noted that starting with this quarter Nintendo has the opportunity to begin appealing to a wider audience now that it's sated the early adopters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more information, be sure to read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDY2MzU1NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMjY4MzU0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1VMNUZHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.LE6GP3UTebmLsJ8NMH5owMDSVfAgjvJ76QZvezdERSM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">the full story on Bloomberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
