It claims the perpetrator was influenced to commit violent acts after playing the action series, leading to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two adults.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kelly shared the development costs for the three title the shooter allegedly played to provide context to the court as to how the franchise is produced and operates, allowing Activision's legal team to reference that information during proceedings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In doing so, he revealed that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost $450 million to develop&nbsp;across its entire lifecycle.
