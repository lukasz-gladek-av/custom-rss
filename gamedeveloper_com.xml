The studio is fighting back with assistance from Spanish labor union Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testronic purchased Secret 6, which also has offices in Manila, around three years ago but staff at the studio </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-testronic-preparing-to-shutter-outsourcing-studio-secret-6-madrid">claim the Spanish location will be effectively shuttered</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on July 31, 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those based in Madrid say Testronic has failed to provide the studio with business support or work contracts since completing its acquisition in 2023, and believe they have been intentionally sabotaged so the global service provider can prioritize operations in Manila where they say working conditions are "much more precarious and wages much lower."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, Secret 6 Madrid studio leaders have told Game Developer the entire team will strike for five days—across July 17, 21, 22, 23, and 24—unless they receive a final offer from Testronic's legal team that meets their demands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the majority of the studio could be laid off at the end of July, leadership confirmed that eight people will remain under contract with clients until November and December 2025. Those staffers have not ruled out the possibility of striking again.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-future-has-been-stolen-zenimax-union-workers-respond-to-microsoft-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Our lives were upended:' ZeniMax union workers respond to Microsoft layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These eight colleagues are not replaceable, as the clients they work with have specifically requested them (or, at most, someone from the Madrid team who we consider capable of matching their level)," said Secret 6 Madrid leadership in a statement. "Under no circumstances do these clients want to work with the Manila team, as they have mentioned multiple times."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid is demanding Testronic provides fair severance compensation and claims the company has so far tabled offers "far below" their expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our intention was always to continue our professional activity, as we are capable of generating value and benefits if given the opportunity to work on new projects. As the company has decided to shut us down, that possibility has been taken away from us entirely, so we only claim a fair compensation," continues the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Throughout the negotiation process, we have always been open to dialogue and shown flexibility.

That moment was, in hindsight, the first sign that Testronic had stopped actively seeking new projects, as those team members came from a very specialised field that had already been left without projects for some time," added the studio.&nbsp;"This recognition is entirely legal, according to both union lawyers and the private legal advisors who are supporting us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testronic has yet to reply to repeated requests for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
