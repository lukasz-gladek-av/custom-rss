The performer and her legal team have issued a notice requesting sales of Tomb Raider IV-VI be halted immediately while the allegations are addressed. It'll be fascinating to see how this plays out given the furor surrounding generative AI tools and the 'ask forgiveness, not permission' mantra that seems to embody those who use them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft is cutting jobs within its publishing team"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-is-cutting-jobs-within-its-publishing-team">Ubisoft is cutting jobs within its publishing team</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">You might think securing a $1.25 billion investment would stem the tide of layoffs at a company. What a fanciful notion. Ubisoft laid off nine staffers this week (the company said the cuts 'primarily' impacted its publishing division) just months after Tencent rolled barrels of cash in through the front door to enable the French publisher to kickstart a new subsidiary. Ubisoft told us the latest job cuts will ensure its new division can launch swiftly and smoothly. What a relief.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-debuts-family-app-for-parental-control-and-content-filters" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation debuts family app for parental control and content filters</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo Invents New Ways to Have Fun With Old Characters"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters">Nintendo Invents New Ways to Have Fun With Old Characters</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Bloomberg (paywalled)&nbsp; //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Okay, this was actually published last Friday but we're bending a few rules because it's chock full of Nintendo zingers. Bloomberg spoke with a handful of former Nintendo developers to learn how the Japanese company with a unique sense of magic and wonder that feels nigh on impossible to replicate plies that trade. Whether its putting gameplay first and understanding that IP is merely window dressing, or acknowledging that fun is the one true universal language—there's plenty of wisdom in those hills.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Meta employees say they saw child abuse in VR before company blocked research"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-whistleblower-research-kids-vr-former-employees-stock-rcna230131">Former Meta employees say they saw child abuse in VR before company blocked research</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via NBC News // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">This week, two former Meta employees told members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and Law the company's VR products have exposed children to adult content and abuse.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has reshaped its entire business around the notion of fostering the 'Metaverse,' investing in artificial intelligence, and selling VR technology such as the Quest headset.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-heads-to-latin-america-to-help-launch-browser-native-demo-platform-spawnd" target="_self" data-discover="true">Square Enix heads to Latin America to help launch browser-native demo platform Spawnd</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft's curiously low-key Assassin’s Creed announcement in Saudi Arabia&nbsp;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia?utm_campaign=email-post&amp;r=2ov77y">Ubisoft's curiously low-key Assassin’s Creed announcement in Saudi Arabia&nbsp;</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game File //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Ubisoft is being rather coy about whether or not an expansion for Assassin's Creed Mirage is being financed by Saudi Arabia's state-owned investment fund, PIF. As noted by Game File, which offers a wonderful explainer on the situation, the company has been uncharacteristically quiet when promoting and announcing the expansion, aside from when CEO Yves Guillemot took to the stage in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference to unveil the add-on and confirm it will take place in ancient AlUla—a region located in what has become Saudi Arabia. Ubisoft wouldn't be alone in wanting to accept investment from PIF without addressing concerns about where that cash has originated (Saudi Arabia has a track record of human rights abuses), but it's fascinating to see a company so brazenly attempt to swerve the gigantic elephant in the room.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What happens when a colossus like Silksong scuppers your launch plans?"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-happens-when-a-colossus-like-silksong-scuppers-your-launch-plans-">What happens when a colossus like Silksong scuppers your launch plans?</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">It's no secret that Team Cherry's decision to basically shadow drop what might be the most highly-anticipated indie title ever onto the release calendar derailed the plans of more than a few developers. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had been in development for around seven years by the time the studio confirmed a release date in a livestream.

In what I suspect some people might feel is a little tone deaf, the news was nestled inside a 'major funding' announcement that also detailed a number of new executive hires. The company then confirmed it has been ramping up operations in Manilla by making over 160 new hires since July.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
