The experiment introduces a new in-game companion dubbed Jaspar, a quippy personal assistant (not too dissimilar to Siri) that can engage in conversation with players at the push of a button.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/workers-continue-to-champion-unions-unity-shakes-hands-with-fortnite-and-clair-obscur-throws-us-in-an-indie-tizzy-patch-notes-31" target="_self" data-discover="true">Subnautica creators battle Krafton in court, Unity shakes hands with Fortnite, and Clair Obscur throws us in an indie tizzy – Patch Notes #31</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jaspar</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">recognizes the player by name, helps with onboarding, understands the game’s lore, and can highlight threats or key objects in the environment.

Ubisoft was keen to highlight how all of its GenAI-powered characters are capable of responding to contextual voice commands that don't require players to deliver instructions in painstakingly precise detail.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-confirms-1-16-billion-tencent-investment-in-new-subsidiary-is-imminent-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Tencent completes €1.16 billion investment in Ubisoft subsidiary</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, when tasked with completing a puzzle that required Pablo and Sophia to stand on two separate pressure plates, I was able to tell Pablo to "stand on the plate on the left" before asking Sophia to "handle the other one." Both instructions were understood.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was even possible to ask Pablo and Sofia to congratulate each other after a successful combat excursion, while Jaspar actively seeks to engage in offbeat conversation with players throughout the experiment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We use behavior trees, like we did in our games in the past, and then we add a layer with our LLM to take decisions based on this. So, we control design-wise what they can say and do, but then it's up to the LLM to decide based on the context how it should be done. [...] It's about reasoning, what is the state of the game, and then acting," said Manzanares, discussing how those context-based actions unfold.</span></p><p>The pressure plate test / Image via Ubisoft</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Manzanares said the aim with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teammates</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn't to create a video game or a demo, but to instead build something people would "feel" as players, before handing it over to creative directors and internal teams within Ubisoft in an effort to showcase the apparent potential of generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's all about redefining the way you interact with games thanks to your voice. Thanks to the commands you give to your teammates or AI companion, do you feel better? Do you feel like a leader? Do you feel more than what you could feel using a controller? That was the objective," Manzanares continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Why? Because we want to know as soon as possible what works and what doesn't work. If this is something that could be done better with a controller, let's scrap it. Let's not invest time. We don't have the time. Let's not invest time in things that do not matter."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Manzanares acknowledged the experiment was still "rough around the edges," but said the core aim was to build something from scratch that showcases interactive gameplay potential.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recent comments from Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot indicate the company is betting big on that potential becoming reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing the company's AI plans on an earnings call earlier today (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">as transcribed by Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), the long-serving exec said Ubisoft is taking huge steps in applying generative AI to "high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Guillemot suggested the impact of generative AI on video games will be comparable to the shift to 3D, and confirmed Ubisoft hopes to become a leader in the space.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On the player experience side, we are continuing to make progress on groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications, building on our Neo NPCs announcements in 2024.
