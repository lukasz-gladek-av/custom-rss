Basically, the merchant acquirer is the bank that accepts the payment from the customer. But the payment processor does the heavy lifting of actually authorizing and completing the transaction," adds that explainer. "Some platforms, like PayPal, can act as both processor and acquirer, completing your business transactions and securely storing your money in one place."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-will-deploy-targeted-cost-initiatives-and-ai-tech-to-unlock-more-value" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embracer will deploy 'targeted cost initiatives' and AI tech to unlock more value</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp">Providing more context on the Steam Support page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve said the sudden termination will affect Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies&nbsp;other than&nbsp;EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp">In an FAQ</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve offered additional details:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," Valve wrote.
