The aim, he said, is for Digiphile to become the "best place for publishers," which he feels will ultimately allow it to "deliver the best content for our community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything starts with curation. Each Digiphile collection is a limited-time event, made in collaboration with respected voices in each genre to create meaningful showcases that celebrate what’s worth playing right now," said Hill.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-says-destiny-2-has-underperformed-since-it-acquired-bungie" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony says Destiny 2 has underperformed since it acquired Bungie</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our partner-friendly rev share, reseller protections, and post-promotion community support provide a safer, smarter way to engage a new cohort of players well before they would have organically encountered these games, at a time when momentum matters most.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve also built systems that fix long-standing issues in the bundle space, most notably The Digiphile Exchange, which ensures games reach real players instead of sitting unused. Players can trade in keys for games they already own and receive credit toward other titles featured in our collections. This keeps engagement high and key waste low, a necessity for publishers looking to secure more keys for future promotions."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'">Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That partner-friendly revenue share model will see publishers receive a fixed 75 percent cut of every sale—with an additional 5 percent set aside for charity. Hill said partners will receive 100 percent of revenue (minus processing fees) from sales of add-on content such as DLC.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Digiphile doesn’t have a persistent storefront, so each collection is, by design, a limited-time event, maximizing attention and impact while preserving the value of each title," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long-term goal is to remain independent while expanding the platform with a focus on nurturing communities. "Think Letterboxd meets Humble Bundle," says Hill. "We want to be a place where fans can meet up to share, discuss, and celebrate the things they care about."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/halo-infinite-to-receive-final-major-update-after-four-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Halo Infinite to receive final major update after four years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, Hill said the team won't chase "short term gains" and understands that success isn't purely about delivering growth hand over fist. "A smaller, more intentional approach builds trust with both players and partners. We don't mind doing fewer things if it means doing them well," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Digiphile's inaugural game collection, Return of the Immersive Sim, has been launched today in support of the Arbor Day Foundation. It features titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Perepiteia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows of Doubt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>CTRL ALT EGO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Of crossing the rippling event horizon and gazing wide-eyed into the very soul of creation? You are not alone.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enhance, the Japanese company behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris Effect</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Humanity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and most recently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines: Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has spent decades searching for that same sense of nirvana. The indie studio produces kinesthetic puzzlers that prioritize flow and feeling to deliver avant garde experiences that are, at their very best, utterly transcendental.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the most dedicated members of Enhance's flock will be well aware, there is an near-religious quality to the studio's eclectic oeuvre, and that's not by accident. During a recent interview ahead of the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, studio founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi explains there is a slogan within the studio:&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Experience is king, and synesthesia is queen."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But there is something that comes on top," he adds. "which is the word 'Kando.' It means 'to move emotionally.'"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mizuguchi says experience and synesthesia must exist in perfect synchronicity to deliver Kando, which is—in the eyes of the team—as close to perfection as they can possibly get. "They both have to exist, but only when they exist in balance and harmony is when you have the real thing, which is Kando—and Kando is God for us," he continues. "We live by that slogan. And if you don't have Kando, it doesn't matter is one or the other is great. It just doesn't work."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">How poor leadership slows down game development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ascending the stairway to heaven once more with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was no easy task.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're the craftsman, and we're humans&quot;">"We're the craftsman, and we're humans"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mizuguchi says "tuning" has become a key word within Enhance. It's a process that begins at the very outset of production during what he describes as the "grand design phase," which largely consists of intense design discussions, conceptualizing, and prototyping between Mizuguchi and Enhance art director and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director, Takashi Ishihara.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Typically it's just Ishihara and myself, but even at this early phase we end up creating music. It's in a very rough state at this point, but we do that because the music element is so important in defining the structure and the flow of the narrative," says Mizuguchi, noting that long-time music collaborators Hydelic are part of that formative process.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's also important because what happens is, after the music is made, we have to break it down into pieces, because now we're starting to build stages. Once we have that big piece of music, we can break it down and identify which sound effects are going to work with each action—such as when a block drops—and so if we don't have that piece of music it would be almost impossible to do that. Even if it's rough, it's very important to have the music so we can identify what the sound effects are going to sound like."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/leadership-lessons-from-mark-darrah-s-days-at-bioware-game-developer-podcast-episode-57" target="_self" data-discover="true">Leadership lessons from Mark Darrah’s days at BioWare - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 57</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To determine whether they're on the right path at that early stage, Mizuguchi ponders whether those primordial sound effects and sonic movements stir emotion. He says they need to reach a point where they "feel something" before pressing on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwuqiVNs058?si=cSKYq57904KFdwK5" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finding those connections is integral to sparking life into players. From that point on, Miziguchi explains working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was akin to watching a sculpture take shape.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're constantly in the process of making these very fine adjustments so that in the end you have this beautiful piece," he adds. That requires each member of the roughly 20 person team to expertly chip away to unearth the intricacies within.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Miziguchi believes it's an approach that requires an "instinctual" understanding of what the end goal is. It also requires constant communication and perhaps most importantly, trust.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ishihara, who directed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, describes the process as "labor intensive and very challenging."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every person's interpretation of a given thing is going to be different, and that's the same with myself and the team. Each of them are individual creators, designers, artists, and programmers, so for us to speak the same language &nbsp;and really understand each other requires a huge amount of communication back-and-forth," explains Ishihara.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sustainable-games-alliance-launches-emissions-reporting-framework-for-developers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sustainable Games Alliance launches emissions reporting framework for developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says facilitating that constant conversation was probably the most challenging part of directing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then came the next part: communicating with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now we've understood each other, how do we then deliver that and have the players understand? I think in order to deliver that message and communicate to the players, that's where each of the characteristics of Lumines come into play: sound, light, and movement," he says. "We use these elements to communicate with players, but it's all down to basically a parameter per element and how much tuning—there's that key word—we do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's down to an 0.01 percent type of shifting here and there. [...] That is where the true tuning takes place, and I as a director, have taken upon that responsibility to tune it down to the detail where it feels like we're making this as a craft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ishihara believes that unwavering commitment to being intentional is what allows Enhance to produce experiences that resonate with players on a human level. "When I say craftsmanship—we're the craftsman, and we're humans. We are not AI. I want to believe that the soul of the human is what's moving and tuning these parameters down to the detail," he continues. "I want to believe that when humans apply that level of tuning, that it will never be overwritten by something that's AI-made."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We suspect some developers across the industry might agree.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
