It resulted in Q4 revenue falling by 25 percent year-on-year to $457 million.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Revenue within the company's Create Solutions division fell by 47 percent to $152 million—although that accounts for the impact of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-eliminating-265-jobs-and-terminating-weta-fx-partnership">termination of Unity's business agreement with Weta FX</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The year-over-year decrease was driven by our portfolio reset, partially offset by 15 percent growth in subscription revenue, and 50 percent growth in Industry strategic revenue," reads the report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grow Solutions revenue totalled $305 million, down 5 percent year-over-year, albeit with another caveat. "Excluding the impact of the return of customer incentives issued by ironSource prior to the merger ('customer credits') for which we received approximately $21 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, Grow Solutions revenue would have been up 2 percent year-over-year," said Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Q4 revenue from Unity's strategic portfolio (which encompasses the engine, cloud and monetization) was $442 million, up 4 percent year-over-year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg said those quarterly results should provide optimism as the company's works to reshape its business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Company's fourth quarter results meaningfully exceeded expectations on both revenue and profit, underscoring our progress in building a new Unity," said Bromberg.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The successful launch of Unity 6, the appeal of our new pricing model, and the progress we’re making in AI for our advertising customers are providing a lot of optimism for the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking briefly at Unity's annual performance, full-year revenue fell by 17 percent to $1.81 billion. Again, the company said that drop was "driven by our portfolio reset, the Weta FX termination, and decreases in Grow Solutions revenue."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create Solutions revenue declined by 29 percent year-on-year to $614 million.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/neil-druckmann-says-studio-leaders-need-to-ascend-the-ranks-to-make-space-for-next-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last week's DICE 2025 conference hosted by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences kicked off with something of a rarity: a public fireside conversation between two high-profile Sony creative directors Neil Druckmann and Cory Barlog, respectively of Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica. Sony's often keen to be careful of high-profile conversations like this, and the pair had a rare opportunity to speak frankly about the highs and lows of creative leadership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Sony was probably happier with how this conversation went compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/sony-apologizes-after-completely-botching-interview-with-naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann">his previous public conversation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with another PlayStation employee...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Druckmann (who is also studio president at Naughty Dog, and executive produced the HBO series The Last of Us based on the video game of the same name), shared one anecdote that stood out in a conversation about grappling with self-doubt and "putting faith in the process." As he and Barlog mused about why they stay in game development despite the stress, Druckmann indicated he's been thinking about the need for studio leaders to move up the ladder to create space for the next generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He recalled a conversation with Naughty Dog co-founder Jason Rubin where the former studio boss expanded on his decision to leave the company. "He said to me 'I'm leaving Naughty Dog, and that will create a space for everybody who's going to rise up,'" Druckmann recalled. Rubin had pointed to the ascension as Evan Wells (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/naughty-dog-co-president-evan-wells-to-retire-from-studio">former</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Naughty Dog president and co-president) as something that could only happen if he moved on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Druckmann said that encounter has shaped his thinking lately as work progresses on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company's first new series since the debut of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2013. "I think about those opportunities...eventually when I am done with this, it will create a bunch of opportunities for people. I'm slowly just rising up, getting less-involved on the day-to-day stuff on this project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Eventually I'll just be able to remove myself—I don't know how long that will take, but I think about it, and I think about all these great opportunities for people to take on their stress, their ideas, be vulnerable, and do all those things that I had to do."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Druckmann and Barlog aren't headed for the exit yet">Druckmann and Barlog aren't headed for the exit yet</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you are a Naughty Dog developer thinking of waging a Game of Thrones-style power battle for Druckmann's vacated seat, best hold your </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dragons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> horses. He and Barlog don't plan to leave their respective roles any time soon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the pressure and anxiety (which the two spent much of their conversation reflecting on), each of them offered reasons for why they still want to make games when they wake up in the morning. "These days, I think what helps me get more perspective are my kids," he said. "I'm sitting there with my son, watching Stranger Things, and he leans in to me, and it's like 'this is all I need, I don't need much more than this.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But then that compulsion kicks in," he added—though "the end" of his career still seems to rattle around his head.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That question might be plaguing Druckmann because as he noted earlier in the conversation, he's regularly asked by people around him if he's going to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/if-hollywood-adapts-more-games-studios-need-to-reward-devs">transition to TV or movies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. His answer to them is "no, probably not" (then after Barlog teased him for his extensive work on The Last of Us show, he relented and said "I dabble").</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's something so brilliant to me about games. There are way more unknowns, way more risks." He recalled a relevant exchange with The Last of Us lead actor Pedro Pascal, where the actor (possibly frustrated by Druckman's direction) "jokingly" asked "hey, do you like art?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Yeah, do you like art?" Druckmann recalled firing back. Pascal then apparently waxed poetic on the subject. "It's the reason I wake up in the morning," the leading man said. "It's why I live and breathe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You might recall that Pascal was part of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/media/sag-aftra-respond-best-and-final-offer/index.html">2023 actor's strike led by SAG-AFTRA</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, during which union leadership </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/fighting-our-future">repeatedly spotlighted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the need to preserve opportunities for the next generation of on-screen talent. It would seem in games and film, "living and breathing" art isn't just about motivation and making great work, it's about thinking deliberately about where the craft will be when you move on.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
