At the time, the concern was related to the 145 percent tariff imposed on China, where Sony manufactures the majority of its hardware. The cost of the tariffs was projected to have a 100 billion yen impact—around $680 million at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, president and CEO Hiroki Totoki answered a question regarding the possibility of moving hardware manufacturing to the US, saying that "these hardwares [sic] of course can be produced locally," and that "it would be an efficient strategy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But PS5 are [sic] being manufactured in many areas, whether it's going to be manufactured in the US or not it needs to be considered going forward.

SIE global marketing vice president Isabelle Tomatis didn't mention tariffs specifically. Rather, Tomatis said that, similar to "many global businesses," Sony continues to "navigate a challenging economic environment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement came three months after Microsoft </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-is-increasing-hardware-prices-and-bumping-first-party-titles-to-80">announced its own price increase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for consoles and controllers in all eligible markets worldwide.
