The studio's debut game will be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Invincible VS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a tag-team fighting game based on Skybound founder Robert Kirkman's superhero comic Invincible, which gained widestream popularity after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Invincible/0K677J96WQ96K6UY6BL15O70CO">a successful animated adaptation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> debuted on Amazon Prime. The team is led by executive producer (and co-founder) Mike Willette, formerly of Double Helix Games, which developed the 2013 fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Killer Instinct</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A traditional entertainment company like Skybound forming its own game studio is an unusual sight to see in 2025. Skybound, like many owners of notable franchises, previously licensed its properties to game studios like Telltale Games, makers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its sequels. The company spent 2024 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-taps-former-activision-blizzard-exec-to-lead-marketing-efforts">hiring</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a number of game industry executives </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-exec-chris-paulson-joins-skybound-ahead-of-upcoming-game-launch">like former Activision Blizzard vice president of product management Chris Paulson</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, seeming to signal an expanded interest in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also ran </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-turns-to-crowdfunding-for-triple-a-invincible-game">a crowdfunding campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for an unnamed triple-A game set in the world of Invincible. A Skybound spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer that the $678,000 it raised in the campaign is being used to support "multiple projects" at Quarter Up, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Invincible VS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-was-afraid-of-him-french-court-hears-harassment-allegations-against-former-ubisoft-execs" target="_self" data-discover="true">'I was afraid of him:' French court hears harassment allegations against former Ubisoft execs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paulson—now executive vice president and general manager of Skybound Games—explained to Game Developer in an interview that the company is pursuing an in-house game studio strategy in order to more productively bring its comic book properties to the world of video games. "There's just naturally barriers like contracts, relationships and approval rights" said Paulson in reference to the process of working with external licensors. He explained that because Quarter Up is an in-house studio, Kirkman is able to regularly drop in and review the game without any unusual go-between.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skybound's decision for its fist foray into in-house game development to be a fighting game is also a surprising turn of events. The fighting game genre has been brutal (pun intended) for developers to break into. Even the multimillion dollar library of Warner Bros. characters couldn't help </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Multiversus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-shuts-down-three-internal-devs-including-monolith-and-player-first">Player First Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> break into the competitive fighting game community (FGC)—a passionate but hard-to-attract audience fiercely attached to core franchises like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. Rare indie surprises like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217000/Rivals_of_Aether_II/">Rivals of Aether series</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have managed to break through, but few big-budget competitors have landed a killing blow.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-first-xbox-handhelds-have-finally-arrived" target="_self" data-discover="true">The first Xbox handhelds have finally arrived</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Breaking into this world means making a game that stands out, and like many fighting game designers, Willette has his personal bugbears about what it takes to pull that off. He said one major goal at the studio will be to attract new players not just through the lineup of Invincible characters, but also a "tag" system that gives players tools to break out of complex enemy combos by swapping characters. "There's other fighting games where it can be a 'slideshow' the minute you get touched," he said, referring to how successful combos are difficult to break out of in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He rattled off a number of other features meant to create more interactivity between the two players, inevitably taking a breath and realizing he was about to start a GDC talk on fighting game design. "I could talk for hours and hours about this," he said. It's not just the coffee, I swear."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Skybound subsidiary Quarter Up will be leaning on outsourcing partners">Skybound subsidiary Quarter Up will be leaning on outsourcing partners</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A considerable question companies face when founding new game studios in high-GDP countries like the United States is one of cost management. Making a tag-team fighting game is no easy feat, and it can be difficult to turn a profit in this competitive genre.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-screen-punctures-raise-questions-over-hardware-packaging" target="_self" data-discover="true">Reports of Switch 2 screen punctures raise questions over hardware packaging</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paulson and Wilette explained to Game Developer that Quarter Up will be tackling that problem by relying a relatively small core team of developers, while relying on outsourcing and co-development partners partners to scale up production. Wilette explained that Quarter Up's core team focuses on combat design animation, netcode, and other must-haves foundational skillsets for fighting game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's another example of how in a tumultuous game market, company founders are sticking to smaller and smaller core teams </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-deprofessionalization-is-bad-for-video-games">while outsourcing labor that requires more headcount</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In my view, the model of how to make a new game is you have to keep the core of the team small and efficient so that you can adapt to how people react to your product," said Paulson. "The last game I worked on was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo IV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and we had hundreds and hundreds of people, but we knew what the audience is for that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't exactly know what the audience is for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Invincible VS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> yet, and we want to be able to grow with the audience, as opposed to trying to force a certain scale."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
