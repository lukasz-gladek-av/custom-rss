In an email to Bloomberg, Roblox Corp. said the new measures "are part of [our] commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes, according to a company email obtained by the outlet, will require users aged 13 or younger to have parents' permission to access certain chat features within the game creation platform. Players age 9 and younger will also need permission to play games that contain "moderate violence or crude humor," in the email's words.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For parents, there will reportedly be a new account type that will allow them to monitor their child's friends and online activity. Other details on this account type were not mentioned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this year, reports surfaced against Roblox Corp. about its years-long allegations of being </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/parents-sue-i-roblox-i-for-allegedly-hosting-child-grooming-sexual-content">harmful and exploitative</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to its sizable young audience. A </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-roblox-employees-are-worried-it-isn-t-doing-enough-to-stop-child-predators">Bloomberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> report from July claimed staff had become more vocal about their concerns with the game's lack of proper protection for its players, and potential ideas to address these concerns were reportedly shot down by leadership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More recently in early October, research firm </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-report-inflated-user-numbers-child-predator-presence-investors">Hindenburg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> published an extensive report that partially detailed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">alleged child safety problems. In it, the firm alleged how easily accessible sexual content is to young players, including in-game sex games and being solicited for sexual favors or content. In-game chatrooms or player-made games with inappropriate were also said to have no age restrictions enacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox Corp. later individually dismissed both Hindenburg and Bloomberg's reporting. In the former's case, it argued the research firm "neglected to accurately report" on the developer's business, and that "tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We take any content or behavior on the platform that doesnâ€™t abide by its standards extremely seriously," it said on October 9, "and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;has a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent malicious or harmful activity on the platform."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stop me if you've heard this one before. You're reviewing a pitch document, and after a few quick pages describing familiar gameplay (hack-and-slash, magic, etc.), you're bombarded with a few thousand words of backstory that's meant to sound like a groundbreaking new IP that will redefine video games. It sounds great. But how do you have any idea if it will catch on?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, you don't. It's why so many developers beg newcomers to spend less time worldbuilding and more time scrapping together prototypes. But eventually the day comes around when your team does need to build a brand new fantasy setting. You're probably at a smaller studio, you don't have a big franchise to lean on, and you'll only have so much leeway to build big new mechanical systems. What do you do then?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Obsidian Entertainment's been tackling that challenge for most of its lifetime. Its library is filled with games in original worlds like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Pillars of Eternity series (we have to give a shoutout to the original wild-as-heck original role-playing game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while we're here).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plenty of developers who worked on the games are still at the company, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Carrie Patel. The the first-person action adventure game set in the world of Pillars of Eternity is Patel's latest, after rising through the ranks from game writer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/directing-i-the-outer-worlds-i-first-narrative-expansion-i-the-peril-on-gorgon-i-">directing the DLC </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/directing-i-the-outer-worlds-i-first-narrative-expansion-i-the-peril-on-gorgon-i-">The Peril on Gordon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Now on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she's helping the team tackle the daunting task of making the Pillars setting a can't-miss for a wider audience.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/hidetaka-miyazaki-s-advice-for-challenging-game-design-trust-players-" target="_self">Hidetaka Miyazaki's advice for challenging game design: 'Trust players'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the answer to do some riff on "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">familiar, but with a twist?</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" Sort of. Patel said the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team has spent plenty of time picking up where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Josh Sawyer's worldbuilding left off. Sawyer, a history buff, leaned on lesser-explored historical inspirations like the era of the Dutch and East India trading colonies. "Familiar," sure, but probably only if you were paying attention in world history class taught by the high school football coach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is equal parts grounded politics and metaphysical encounters with the divine. Patel explained to Game Developer in a chat at Gamescom 2024 that to make these big-brained concepts accessible to all players, the team looked at them through this lens: how can players use these ideas to build their own stories beyond the narrative?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building your own identity in the strange new world of ">Building your own identity in the strange new world of <span>Avowed</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patel explained that as she's grown into the role of game director, she's expanded how she walks through gameplay when sampling what the team has produced. "You slow down and try to notice each moment of your experience," she said. The questions she asks herself include "when am I excited? When am I curious? When is my attention starting to wane? What's drawing me from moment to moment?" Obsidian's practices of iterating fast and putting content in the build "quickly" make it more possible for her to bring those questions back to her peers and give them time and direction to iterate with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're questions players will undoubtedly be asking themselves when they pick up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, since for many it will be their first time entering the complex world of Eora. The game is set in a region called "The Living Lands," where political players and gods are wheeling and dealing to control the world. "I've enjoyed finding the stories that thread both of those worlds together," she said with palpable excitement. What makes it possible for players to pick up her enthusiasm is a clear sense of direction that they need to make their own choices about the world.</span></p><p>Sometimes that choice is "what to do about this bear?" Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's metaphysical elements are defined by the idea that like real-world religions (depending on who you ask), there's no "one right answer" that determines how the divine works. She recalled reading Reddit threads where players debated the ending of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and arguing about which god to support as being "clearly the right choice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trick, however, is that developers don't want those to be "even" choices, especially "morally" even ones. "It's not saying all things have an equal moral weight to them, but you're not trying to say 'player, this is what you must choose,'" she said. "You're saying 'player, here's a world and here's a conflict and all of its complexities, and there's not always going to be an easy solution.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players enjoy defining a setting for themselves">Players enjoy defining a setting for themselves</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Obsidian's long made games in this wayâ€”a way that places a remarkable amount of trust in players. You might look back to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company's take on the Fallout series which gives players a far wider array of narrative tools to influence the Wasteland than its predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Bethesda Softworks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patel's experience echoes some advice like we've heard from game directors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/hidetaka-miyazaki-s-advice-for-challenging-game-design-trust-players-">Hidekai Miyazaki</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. His words "trust players" feel present in her words, but she also captured why it still takes an incredible amount of work to build that trust in the first place.</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Letting players define their place in the setting "gives players something to chew on," she said, adding that it's "one of the most interesting aspects of roleplay."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's not just 'who am I mechanically, what's my vibe.' It's also 'what do I believe in, and how do the situations I'm encountering in this world force me to answer that question?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Force" there is the key word. In an industry that leans on "power fantasies" to excite and attract players, being forced to do anything can be an off-putting pitch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe if you're one of those worldbuilding-minded developers (look, I feel you, I have a few mega-tomes sitting on my personal hard drive), that's what your game world needs. Not just a history and events that inform itâ€”but the ingredients that push the player around and make them want to define themselves in a grand adventure.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
