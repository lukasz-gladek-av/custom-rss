I'm writing this week's intro while listening to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQlAEiCb8m0">Stardust banger 'Music Sounds Better With You'</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and wondering how the French trio (which includes one half of Daft Punk) managed to create what might be the greatest single of all time. Answers on a postcard please.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I digress. We're not here to talk about transcendental dance tracks. We're here to discuss video games. This week was a time for heroes and villains. Nintendo probably convinced more than a few Switch 2 holdouts (this one included) to clamber on the bandwagon with a stunning </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcase. Ubisoft Halifax employees also took a stand in the industry-wide fight for workers' rights by filing for unionization with CWA Canada. It's another positive step for those who believe unionization will change the industry for the better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In more concerning news, Embracer Group released its latest annual report and confirmed it reduced its headcount by almost 2,000 employees over the past year. Layoffs weren't the only factor behind that decline, but it's a number that underlines the scale of mismanagement at the Swedish conglomerate. PlayStation also delayed Bungie's upcoming shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, leaving many to ponder when the project will see the light of day—and what shape it'll take.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-reduced-its-headcount-almost-2-000-employees-last-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embracer Group reduced its headcount by almost 2,000 employees last year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.

It's another notable step forward for game industry workers in their bid to claw back autonomy from corporate leaders and fight for better working conditions and job security. In a mission statement published on the CWA Canada website, unionizing employees said they will strive to ensure all workers, but especially those from historically marginalized communities, are treated with "fairness, dignity, and respect."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Warner Bros.

Discovery wants to make like an amoeba and split into two separate companies, but where does that leave the firm's video game division? According to an announcement sent out this week, Warner Bros. Games will be housed within the new Streaming &amp; Studios division and focus on developing video games based on a handful of major franchises. An executive reshuffle has also seen three current studio heads take on the mantle of senior vice president to oversee the company's new IP-driven production slate.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/aggro-crab-side-hustle-peak-has-sold-100-000-copies-in-24-hours" target="_self" data-discover="true">Aggro Crab and Landfall 'side hustle' Peak has sold 100,000 copies in 24 hours</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embracer Group reduced its headcount by almost 2,000 employees last year"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-reduced-its-headcount-almost-2-000-employees-last-year">Embracer Group reduced its headcount by almost 2,000 employees last year</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Where do you even start with Embracer? The company spent years treating the video game industry like an all you can eat buffet, but after loading its plate with a mountain of studios and franchises decided it wasn't hungry after all. The layoffs, closures, and divestments that followed that rampant merger and acquisition spree were relentless, with 1,400 people being laid off by the end of 2023. That was just the beginning. Thanks to its latest annual report, we know Embracer parted ways with almost 2,000 employees during the last fiscal year. All of those departures might not have been the result of layoffs—the company made significant divestments over the past 12 month—but it's downsizing that once again highlights the human cost of managerial ineptitude.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Meta-owned Beat Saber developer Beat Games axes support for PS4 and PS5"><a target="_blank" href="https://beatsaber.com/faq.html#PS4-PS5">Meta-owned Beat Saber developer Beat Games axes support for PS4 and PS5</a></h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/warner-bros-games-restructures-around-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-dc" target="_self" data-discover="true">Warner Bros.

Given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beat Saber</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a ludicrously popular VR title—it has over 10 million users on Meta Quest alone—the decision to scrap support is hardly a ringing endorsement for PlayStation VR headsets.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct blows the bloody doors off"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct blows the bloody doors off</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Nintendo (YouTube) //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Nintendo, you old dog.

Fresh from declaring the Switch 2 its biggest console launch ever, the Japanese company turned the spotlight on upcoming platformer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and sent the internet into a frenzy. The 18-minute showcase was delirium inducing and highlighted a title that looks as polished and creative as you'd expect from the company behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A July 17 launch date feels like a masterstroke at this stage, giving people who resisted the urge to purchase a Switch 2 at launch a ludicrously compelling reason to take the plunge in the console's second month on shelves.

Last week, it unveiled its first ever Xbox handheld and now it has penned a "strategic, multi-year agreement" with chip maker AMD to co-engineer a range of devices, including the "next generation" of Xbox consoles. Xbox president Sarah Bond said the deal is all about building a "gaming platform" that's always with players. In short, she explained Microsoft wants to build an Xbox experience that isn't&nbsp; "locked to a single store or tied to one device." Microsoft has already shown willing to bring its major franchises to rival platforms like Nintendo Switch and PlayStation and make Xbox Game Pass accessible beyond the Xbox ecosystem. It seems that slowly breaking down those platform barriers remains the plan moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Aggro Crab and Landfall 'side hustle' Peak has sold 100,000 copies in 24 hours"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/aggro-crab-side-hustle-peak-has-sold-100-000-copies-in-24-hours">Aggro Crab and Landfall 'side hustle' Peak has sold 100,000 copies in 24 hours</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Earlier this year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Aggro Crab told us it would be pivoting to smaller projects after struggling to secure funding for a big swing.

The project will reportedly be similar in tone to Predator: Killer of Killers and the recently announced animated John Wick prequel.

The title had been slated to launch on September 23, but has now been pulled from the release slate after a Closed Alpha yielded rather mixed feedback.
