The chaotic co-op action shooter scooped up four trophies across the evening, giving Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt and deputy game director Mauricio Redondo plenty of chances to swing through the press room. That in turn gave us a chance to snag insights on its creative ambitions following a year of big success (and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-responds-to-mostly-negative-steam-rating-with-the-promise-of-patch-that-makes-significant-changes">occasional struggles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our number one question had to do with the future of the game's "Galactic Campaign" system. Easily one of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s most defining characteristics, the "campaign" unites players with shared collective objectives that alter the ebb and flow of Super Earth's war against the giant bugs and murderous robots threatening Managed Democracy. The feature, stewarded by a "game master" named Joel creates a dynamic online space where Arrowhead can react to player surges in success—or major defeats—without requiring a new patch or content pack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At DICE, Pilestedt and Redondo said there's still plenty of more design space to mine in the Campaign system, and said the team is working on systems that will give the player community "more agency" to shape the galaxy in the months ahead. "The point is, we want the community to be able to build their sandcastles...and for Joel to stomp on them," Pilestedt said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/helldivers-2-has-a-god-and-his-name-is-joel" target="_self" data-discover="true">Helldivers 2 has a god and his name is Joel</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Player unification in ">Player unification in <span>Helldivers 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He elaborated that the Campaign's greatest strength is that it drives player "unification" and creates opportunities for players to organize as a kind of bullet-driven democracy. Some objectives in 2024 tasked players with the choice between liberating two different planets: saving one would grant everyone anti-tank mines, and saving the other would protect "Super Citizen Anne's Hospital for Very Sick Children" (with no gameplay award attached)." Players could either coordinate off-platform to direct efforts toward one planet or another—or bicker and risk saving neither.
