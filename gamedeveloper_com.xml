"It's an honor and a dream for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Megabonk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'. I've made games in the past under different studio names, so </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Megabonk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not my debut game," the developer wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a follow-up post, Vedinad said he appreciates the nomination, support, and votes, but that ultimately, the nomination "doesn't feel right in this category."

"[Vedinad], a nominee for Best Debut Indie Game, reached out to clarify that he is an established solo developer who had been presenting himself as a new creator under the name Vedinad," Keighley wrote. "We’re grateful for his honesty. As a result, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MegaBonk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be removed from the category."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-there-wouldn-t-be-any-deal-krafton-ceo-laments-unknown-worlds-acquisition-in-court" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton wouldn't have bought Subnautica studio if it had known of founder's alleged exit strategy, says CEO</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keighley then said Vedinad will "share more about his story when he's ready," while adding that The Game Awards respects his decision not to want to take recognition away from other debut teams. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Megabonk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched on September 18 and went out to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/indie-hit-megabonk-moves-over-a-million-copies-in-two-weeks">sell over a million copies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the following two weeks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Once again, the term 'indie' in The Game Awards is fuzzy">Once again, the term 'indie' in The Game Awards is fuzzy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While a nominee withdrawing from The Game Awards isn't common, the past few years have seen the game industry arguing about some of the nominees for indie categories.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A notable example includes The Game Awards 2023, in which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dave-the-diver-has-topped-3-million-sales-in-under-six-months">Dave the Diver</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was nominated for Best Indie Game. The term "indie" was fuzzy at best, considering the game's developer, Mintrocket, is a subsidiary of South Korean conglomerate Nexon, which owns a myriad of studios and has published massive series like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Maple Story</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, Keighley weighed into the debate, saying that independent is "sort of a broad term" that can mean different things to different people (via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/">VGC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can argue, does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, does it mean the team size? Is it the kind of independent spirit of the game, meaning a smaller game that's sort of different? I think everyone has their own opinion about this, and we really defer to our jury of 120 global media outlets who vote on these awards, to make that determination of 'is something independent' or not," Keighley said during an interview panel on Twitch.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-store-enables-gifting" target="_self" data-discover="true">After seven years, the Epic Games Store enables gifting</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In July of this year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dave the Diver</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Hwang Jae-ho told 4gamer that "there's nothing indie" about the game (as translated by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we're developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique," the director said. "For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, 'hey, isn't that a Nexon game?', but it's not like we applied for the award ourselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Approaching the end of 2025, the definition of "indie" has been vague for so long that almost every one of the nominees could be criticized for not being truly indie. Going back to this year's Best Debut Indie Game category, both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blue Prince</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have clear indie credentials, but were published by larger studios (Raw Fury and Panic, respectively). Meanwhile, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been publicly heralded as the work of around 30 people, a narrative that, as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-geoff-keighley-clair-obscur-expedition-33-was-not-made-by-a-team-of-under-30-developers-and-devs-say-repeating-the-myth-is-a-dangerous-path/">PC Gamer dove into</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, excludes all the external partners and outsourcing work that contributed to the game, with the needed funding to support the game's own development notwithstanding.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hypixel-acquires-hytale-back-from-riot-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hypixel acquires Hytale back from Riot Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ironically the self-published, small-team-made&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Megabonk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;may have the greatest claim to being "indie" of the bunch.
