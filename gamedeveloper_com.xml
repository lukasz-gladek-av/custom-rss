Every title that makes it to market is a miracle in itself. The product of hard-working creatives who continue to pour themselves into an industry that feels more hostile by the day.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you connect with a game, you're having a conversation with the people who made it. You're seeing the world through their eyes. Experiencing play from their perspective. It's a singular experience that we must strive to celebrate. Otherwise, what's the point of all this?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Baby Steps"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/">Baby Steps</a><span> ( Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, Bennett Foddy / Devolver Digital)</span></h2><p>Image via Devolver Digital</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence">attempted to explain</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earlier this year, the true greatness of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it left me questioning my entire existence by posing an excruciatingly simple but impossibly vast question: why do we do the things we do?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In video games, we often complete perfunctory tasks to progress quests, unlock gear, or chase high scores. Baby Steps offers nothing of the sort. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In fact, the punishing walking simulator actively tells players to avoid pursuing perceived goals. Do not spent hours climbing that crumbling tower. There is nothing at the top. No magical item. No life-altering vista. Nothing. So, why did I spend an evening trying and failing to do precisely that? I'll let you know when I figure it out.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-trends-that-made-and-plagued-this-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 game industry trends that made (and plagued) this year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Battlefield 6: RedSec - Gauntlet"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/">Battlefield 6: RedSec - Gauntlet</a> (Battlefield Studios / Electronic Arts)&nbsp;</h2><p>Image via EA</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't think I've ever included an individual game mode in this list, but Gauntlet is just that good. The knockout slalom is the lesser-advertised portion of Battlefield 6's freemium RedSec offering, which is largely centred on two Battle Royale modes (for duos and four-person squads).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gauntlet, however, eschews the last-person-standing trend by instead asking eight squads to battle for supremacy in a series of rapid-fire, objective-driven rounds in which only the top teams progress. Eight squads become six. Six become four. Four become two. Until, finally, a victor emerges. The fast-paced tournament format works wonders in tandem with Battlefield 6's kinetic gameplay, which feels all the more intense in close quarters. Teams that fail to work together are quickly found out in modes that riff on classics like Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. it's a free-to-play affair that feels like a genuine steal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-10-events-that-defined-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 events that defined the year for game developers - 2025 Wrap-up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ghost of Yotei"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> (Sucker Punch Productions / PlayStation)</h2><p>Image via Sucker Punch</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I bounced off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when it launched in 2020. I remember adoring the world Sucker Punch had crafted while feeling the opening act was a tad too paint-by-numbers, both narratively and mechanically. I never made it more than about 10 hours before uninstalling, even the second time around.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully, Ghost of Yotei righted both of those wrongs. The sequel immediately drops players into the middle of a murderous revenge arc and maintains a welcome sense of urgency throughout. It's also far more generous where combat and exploration is concerned, letting players tune their playstyle with a wider variety of weapons, tools, and armour kits that demand mastery. It's all wheat and no chaff, and that's precisely what I crave these days.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lumines Arise"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/">Lumines Arise</a><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/">&nbsp;</a> (Enhance, Monstars Inc. / Enhance)</h2><p>Image via Enhance</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris Effect</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> remains an absolute all-timer and one of my comfort games, so you can imagine my delight when Enhance announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a spiritual successor that takes the studio's own block-busting puzzler and ponders 'what if you were playing this in the middle of the Berghain?'&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-famed-developer-vince-zampella-has-passed-away-at-age-55" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Famed developer Vince Zampella has passed away at age 55</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer is, of course, 'that would be fucking mint.' &nbsp;Sometimes you just want to lose yourself and play a proper Video Game. No thoughts, just thwomping beats, psychedelic visuals, and more vibes than one of those special cafes in Amsterdam. You'll be running this one back again and again and again.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rematch"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138720/REMATCH/">Rematch</a> (Sloclap / Kepler Interactive)</h2><p>Image via Sloclap</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rematch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> bore into my brain with the herculean force of a Yeboah volley when it landed in April.

Last minute screamers. Game winning slide tackles. Clutch goalkeeping moments that'd make Gianluigi Buffon jealous. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rematch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has it all in spades.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
