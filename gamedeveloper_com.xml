It will also work to "humanize developers and their process while holding studios accountable for their actions [and] create content that is made by humans, for humans, without catering to algorithms."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The editorial team comprises Alice Jovanée (owner and founder), Cass Marshall (owner and founder), Jeffrey Parkin (owner and founder), Ryan Gilliam (owner and founder), Clayton Ashley (contributor and founder), Pat Gill (contributor and founder), and Toussaint Egan (contributor and founder).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"2025 has been rough for everyone. Games and games journalism are no exception.

This often demands writers cater to Google above all else. It's why AI has started to permeate your favorite websites, and why headlines feel like 'clickbait.' In a 'growth forever' economy, it's the only way for these websites to keep going, and unfortunately that often isn't enough."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This cycle is only going to get worse in the future. We aim to fight against that, as so many incredible independent sites before us have. We will write about what we want to write about, and what we think our audience will enjoy. We don't need an algorithm to tell us what the people want when you can just tell us yourselves."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Nobody can shut us down or sell us.&quot;">"Nobody can shut us down or sell us."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rogue was established in partnership with independent tabletop gaming site, Rascal, but is completely worker-owned.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rogue.site/news/welcome-to-rogue/#who-is-rogue">In an extensive FAQ,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the Rogue team explained the four owners are full-time staffers who will field news, write reviews, conduct interviews, and pen guides.

If we want to cover a rad indie game instead of a triple-A release, nobody can stop us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an independent outlet, Rogue will shun advertising and sponsored articles to avoid "ethical concerns." Instead, it will adopt a reader-supported model built around a range of subscription options.
