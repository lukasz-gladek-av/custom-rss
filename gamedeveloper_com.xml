Its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://embracer.com/summary/interim-report-q2-fy-24-25/#press-release">interim report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows the Entertainment/Services and Games divisions—and the latter's individual PC/Console, tabletop, and mobile sub-segments—had downturns across the board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC/Console games had the biggest decline: net sales fell to 2.12 billion SEK ($193.2 million), down 46 percent year-over-year. CEO Lars Wingefors contributed that decline to the lack of new releases: whereas 2023-2024's second quarter had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Payday 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remnant II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the 2024-2025 quarter mainly saw a re-release of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the 1.0 launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wingefors, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "slower than expected" digital sales, despite its positive reception, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reportedly performed above expectations and saw a "solid inflow" of new players. The Entertainment/Services division also had a sizable tumble of 35 percent, which was attributed to "few new releases."</span></p><p>Embracer cited 'few new releases' as reason for declines in its PC/Console game sub-segment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mobile games had less of a fall at 1.36 billion SEK ($123.9 million) in net sales, which translates to a roughly 8 percent decline compared to 2023-2024's Q2. Wingefors believes the improved market conditions that drove player activity and improved revenue growth for this quarter will continue through the fiscal year's second half.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the interim report, Wingefors also commented on Embracer's recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-divests-mobile-studio-easybrain-in-1-2-billion-deal">$1.2 billion sale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of mobile developer Easybrain, which he hopes will "put us in a much stronger position to drive value, both in the short- and long-term."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a 5 percent dip in net sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-embracer-coo-asmodee-should-be-great-at-handling-900-million-debt">Asmodee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (or the tabletop sub-segment) was commended for having a "strong execution" between July and September. Asmodee's decrease in publishing partners was said to be balanced out by a growth in the games published during the quarter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking ahead, Embracer expects growth in earnings for Entertainment/Services during the third quarter, along with lower earnings for the larger 2024-2025 fiscal year. Growth in the Entertainment division is expected to come from the Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim anime film, which bows on December 13.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the losses, that can be owed to adjusted expectations for the first half of the fiscal year, and several PC/Console games that have already been (or are expected to be) delayed, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Breaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

After working in game development for over 5 years—designing the economy and balance for projects that have generated over $150 million in revenue — I decided to disappear for the last six months to consolidate all my knowledge in game economy, balancing, and monetization into one work and share it with other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are very few materials in this field; as of writing this article in the fall of 2024, there are only about 20 scientific articles and a couple of books, one of which is an 800-page tome by Brenda Romero and Ian Schreiber.

Professor and PhD Edward Castronova argues that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>currency stability</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>price rationality</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>proper resource distribution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are the three pillars that will help you create a sustainable economy [2]. Let’s examine each of them in more detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To illustrate key principles of economic design, we will sometimes refer to "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Budget Adventure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"—a fictional game whose developers didn’t really care about the economy and just made things up randomly.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Pillar 1. Currency Stability">Pillar 1. Currency Stability</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your in-game currency is the lifeblood of the economic system. If the blood circulates irregularly, the body cannot function properly. The same thing happens with a game economy: unstable currency leads to chaos and player dissatisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the currency to be stable, it must fulfill three main functions:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Medium of exchange</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — it should be used for transactions. Imagine a game where a player can easily propose: "I’ll give you 50 gold for that helmet." This is important because it allows players to trade goods without barriers, even if their items are not directly comparable in value (e.g., trading a horse for a staff).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unit of account</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — the currency should allow for the valuation of goods and services. This simplifies the process of trade and makes meaningful discussions about the value of different items in the game possible. A player should be able to ask, "How much is my house worth in golden dragons?" A stable currency gives players and developers a clear understanding of how much each item is worth in the game world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Store of value</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> — players should be able to save currency with confidence that its value will be preserved. This allows them to set aside earned funds, making the game world more persistent and reliable. Players need to know that even if they take a break from the game, they will be able to use their savings when they return.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In "Budget Adventure," the currency fluctuates so wildly that players never know how much their loot is worth. One day a sword costs 100 gold, and the next day it’s 10,000. Player "PoorPlanner" decides to save 10,000 gold to buy a legendary sword. After many days of farming, he finally collects the required sum, but by the time of purchase, the sword’s price has soared to 500,000 gold. Now he’s running around with a carrot instead of a sword.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take a real example: in Diablo 2, by the end of the game, gold had become so devalued that players stopped using it and switched to a more stable item — the Stone of Jordan.

But to understand how it works, let’s turn to the science of the brain—neurobiology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our brain, the result of millions of years of evolution, constantly seeks balance between stimulation and satisfaction. Two neurotransmitters play a central role in this process: dopamine and endorphins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dopamine</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the "anticipation hormone" that motivates us to keep going in hopes of a reward. It is activated during moments of expectation, whether it's waiting for a new level, a rare item, or defeating a tough boss. In an evolutionary context, dopamine was crucial for survival. Imagine our ancestors: searching for food, avoiding predators—these activities required constant effort and activity. Dopamine in such situations "turned on" motivation and maintained interest in seeking rewards, even when they were just beyond the horizon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Endorphins</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, on the other hand, are released when the reward is received, causing feelings of joy and satisfaction. It’s like an internal "prize" for achieving a goal. Endorphins also have a pain-relieving effect, which literally helps us "forget" the difficulties we faced on the way to success. In games, as in life, endorphins encourage us to return to what brings pleasure and fulfillment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, understanding how these neurotransmitters work, it becomes clear why emotional swings are not just about playing with resources, but about the science of keeping the player in a constant state of seeking and satisfaction. It’s important not only to reward the player but also to skillfully create moments of anticipation, so dopamine drives them to new achievements, while endorphins reinforce success and the desire to continue.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a player named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BeautyQueen278</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stuck on level 189 of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Candy Crush Saga</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every time BeautyQueen278 gets close to the final combination, but the candies don’t quite line up, her brain is literally bathed in dopamine: "Just one more try, I’m almost there!" It feels like victory is just around the corner. At this point, she’s ready to buy a booster... but here’s the interesting thing: this balance between frustration and anticipation is what keeps her playing. Finally, on the 11th attempt, BeautyQueen278 beats the level, and her brain is flooded with endorphins. She’s so happy she could soar like the candies on the screen. But you know what makes the difference here? BeautyQueen278 is not only given the victory but also a small gift—another life after so many attempts. This is the perfect balance: you’ve won, but they give you just enough resources to keep you playing without feeling totally drained.</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players should experience two or three different emotions in a single session. This helps maintain interest and motivation. If players experience frustration several times in a row, they may lose interest in the game.

At the beginning of the game, you should generously distribute content to grab players' attention and give them the chance to feel successful. In the first few sessions, players should receive rewards quickly and easily. This allows them to familiarize themselves with the game’s resources and become accustomed to them.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a puzzle game where the player has just started.

Your task is to translate all in-game values into units of time.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Example: Imagine a game where players need to complete 300 levels. If an average player completes 10 levels a day, we can assume that the entire game will take about a month to finish.

It wouldn't be a stretch to say there was almost no monetization back then. :) People’s understanding in this area also varies greatly — some know the basics, since we all visit stores and see red price tags, while some readers are more advanced in this topic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yes, I mentioned red price tags for a reason — the methods used by giants like Amazon and Walmart are not much different from those used in Candy Crush Saga, Royal Match, or Diablo IV.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, the sales market is one of the oldest out there, with real user data filling vast data centers, while millions of specialists work daily to find ways to sell you just a bit more.

The answer lies in player psychology and behavior. Using virtual currency reduces the psychological barriers associated with spending real money. Studies show that players are more willing to spend virtual currency as it’s perceived as less valuable than real money.

Let’s look at some figures for 2024 (according to AppMagic):</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $12.3 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $8.5 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Genshin Impact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $4.4 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brawl Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: $1.76 billion from in-app purchases (IAP).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these games use loot boxes and other casino mechanics, and in some, they are the core of monetization. For example, in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brawl Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, without gacha (loot boxes), you can’t unlock new characters, meaning you can’t fully play without spinning for chests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players love the thrill and uncertainty. Every time they open a chest or spin the gacha, they get a dopamine rush, dreaming of a legendary reward. It’s not just a random prize—it’s a whole psychological ritual. The anticipation of a reward, rarity of the drop, and time limits increase engagement. Every gamer has a little hamster inside, trembling with excitement for unique loot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there’s a flip side. Studies show a consistent correlation between loot boxes and problematic gambling [23]. A study commissioned by the UK Department for Culture, Media, and Sport noted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>15 studies</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirmed a link between loot box spending and signs of problematic gambling. This issue raises concerns, and in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, loot boxes are already banned by law.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers I’ve spoken with feel that casino work is undignified. I exist in game dev to create new worlds, captivate players, give valuable experiences, and help people grow and improve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the truth is, this monetization model will continue to thrive because it’s incredibly effective.

A sword for 100 gold, a dragon for 5000. But what do we forget? Economics doesn’t like dictates. It needs to operate independently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine telling a farmer his carrots must cost 5 silver, and an immortality potion 5000 gold.

No one goes to market and says, "So, chicken eggs will cost 50 today, and coffee, 300." The market decides for itself. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Supply creates demand</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and when someone starts artificially controlling prices, as governments sometimes do, the result is often disastrous. History offers many examples: a country tries to set fixed prices on goods, leading to shortages and black markets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So why do we so persistently try to dictate the price of dragons and potions in our game worlds?</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Let the Virtual World Have Its Freedom">Let the Virtual World Have Its Freedom</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if we allowed the world we create to set prices on its own? Imagine setting base parameters and then launching a simulation. For instance, if you’re creating an MMORPG in a fantasy style, all prices are set by us, the game designers; at best, players set their own prices at auctions or exchanges. Take EVE Online, where wars destroy game assets worth </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hundreds of thousands of dollars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in real money. But it’s still child’s play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>world lived on its own</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?

This is where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>multi-agent AI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> comes in.

A mage crafting a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rain of Fire Tome</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might sell it for a fortune if demand is high. Running such a simulation thousands of times would create a natural </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ecosystem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where the economy lives by its own rules, not requiring your intervention.

I remember how my university professor, Igor Vereninov, told us about the problem of solving binary trees. It’s a mathematical structure where each branch contains branches and nodes that can be solved in two ways: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>top-down</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (starting from the root) or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>bottom-up</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (starting from the leaf nodes).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you start from the tree’s “leaves” (i.e., the lowest elements) and try to work your way up, the complexity of the task grows exponentially with the tree size, as does the chance of error.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why does this happen? Because each branch depends on the nodes above, and the nodes depend on the root. If you start from the bottom, you lack the data to make the correct decision because you can’t see the big picture; you’re solving problems in a vacuum.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now imagine that your game economy is a massive binary tree with millions of branches. Each branch of the tree represents the price of an item in your game, from a can of pickles to a dragon steel hoe.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">From a tree worth 1 copper comes a wooden plank worth 2 coppers;

But what is 4X? It’s a genre where players complete four main tasks: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>explore</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>expand</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exploit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exterminate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>Left: Ad for Frozen City. Right: Ad for Whiteout Survival</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 4X genre is one of the most monetizable on mobile platforms, with numerous games exceeding $1 billion in revenue. Examples include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rise of Kingdoms</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lords Mobile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game of War</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the recent hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Whiteout Survival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, many developers are already incorporating 4X elements into their games, even if they’re not strictly strategy titles.

Suppose you design a system full of paywalls, preventing players from fully accessing the game. This forces players to pay to gain an advantage over others. Just like that, you’ve created a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>pay-to-win</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game—a model players despise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, purchasable items should be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>bonuses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and, more importantly, players should be able to finish the game without needing to pay. This makes in-game purchases a luxury, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not a requirement</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. After all, players should pay not because they’re </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>forced</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to, but because they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>want</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to support the game and enjoy additional content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, remember that excessive focus on monetization can make you forget the main purpose of creating games. Why are we in this business? First and foremost, to provide an exceptional experience for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Major game studios, which once produced fantastic games remembered by players decades later, sometimes devolve into bureaucracy and business, forgetting their original purpose. They turn games into lifeless, dull copies of the original. You download such a game—the graphics are beautiful, there are no bugs, and the story progresses along familiar lines, but something feels </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>off</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. You may not realize it right away, but subconsciously, you sense: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the game has no soul</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It’s just another product on the conveyor belt, created to maximize profits but not to give players a truly engaging and memorable experience. The goal is to create something that touches players, that they’ll discuss with friends and want to relive.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s not just about ‘games,’ for me, personally, it never has been.
