Primarily, its purpose is to create a framework that "maps how the design of children’s digital experiences affects their well-being and provides guidance on how informed design choices can promote positive well-being outcomes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In essence, LEGO and UNICEF want game designers to implement features that make online games safe for children to be themselves, connect with others their own age (and of different backgrounds and living situations), and grow their skills and as people. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/1036/file/RDT-Framework-Poster-A4-nmarkup.pdf">suggested framework</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was developed in consultation with nearly 800 children across the globe, and covers key areas such as autonomy, safety, creativity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</span></p><p>The key aspects of Lego/UNICEF's RDT framework.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, if a designer wanted to use the framework to develop experiences based around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/media/1121/file/RDT-CardsDesktop.pdf">autonomy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">? They need to make sure the experience lets kids "feel in control and make decisions about their gameplay [and] develop their own strategies to survive and progress."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Likewise, DEI-focused experiences should allow children to see themselves through their custom-made in-game avatars, including options for different skin tones and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/bioware-pulls-back-the-veil-on-dragon-age-the-veilguard-s-magical-hair-tech">hairstyles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or "assertive technologies" like wheelchairs and other mobility aids. It may also mean designing experiences for kids who do not have consistent internet access, or who have limited hardware and funds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quotes from children surveyed further show they have thoughts on each aspect: in the Autonomy section, a group of Bulgarian children (aged 12-15 years old) say they enjoy titles that give "opportunities for a child to make different choices." A 9-year-old in Australia added that games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Goat Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have helped her process her emotions: "If I’m feeling angry, sometimes I just go headbutt a tree or something."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Concerns about video games' effect on kids have always been a talking point, and become more prominent within the past decade. It's only been relatively recently that the industry has made a greater effort to address this, as large game platforms like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have increased their child safety measures to ensure their young players are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-adds-more-parental-overwatch-to-its-revamped-child-safety-procedures">interacting with the right people</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or know what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-fortnite-i-brings-in-game-age-ratings-to-player-made-content">player-made content</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they're getting into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The risk of young players enduring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/adl-warns-that-sexist-and-racist-in-game-harassment-is-continuing-to-rise">harassment or witnessing supremacist ideology</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has also been an issue in recent years.
