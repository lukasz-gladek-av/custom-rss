In a pre-trial brief filed by the conglomerate earlier this month (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/951321200/Defendant-Krafton-Inc-s-Pretrial-Brief-11-14-25">uploaded by Game Developer on Scribd</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), Krafton accused the former execs of becoming "absentee landlords" after purportedly downing tools and stealing confidential information on their way out of the door.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-store-enables-gifting" target="_self" data-discover="true">After seven years, the Epic Games Store enables gifting</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testifying in court on November 18, 2025, Kim stated that Krafton was unaware Cleveland and McGuire had stopped contributing to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He also claimed both former execs were given the opportunity to return to their posts but rejected the offer, and that Cleveland specifically was determined to pursue unrelated movie projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Kim repeatedly stated that Krafton would never have spent an initial $500 million on Unknown Worlds in 2021 had it known the leadership team would allegedly seek to abandon their posts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There wouldn't be any deal," replied Kim, when asked what would have happened if Cleveland had informed him before the acquisition that he wanted to stop making video games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There wouldn't be any deal, I don't think," replied Kim, when asked what would have happened if Cleveland had informed him that, post-acquisition, he would play no part in the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, Kim was asked whether Krafton would have granted the trio operational control of Unknown Worlds had it known Cleveland and McGuire would allegedly abandon </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "The single purpose of Unknown Worlds is to make games. And if they are not making any games, I don't think—there is no meaning for them to have any operational control. I don't think I would have given it to them," he replied.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hypixel-acquires-hytale-back-from-riot-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hypixel acquires Hytale back from Riot Games</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I believed that the fans would eventually get disappointed&quot;">"I believed that the fans would eventually get disappointed"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim also questioned why Krafton would now allow the former executives to return to their posts. "These are the people who rejected our proposal for them to return to their post. So why they would like to return now, and what are they going to do, I'm not sure about that," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And currently the development team is pretty stabilized, and they are working on the development in earnest. So I am concerned about if—about their potential return, if they do return. And, thirdly, the trust is, I think, already broken, so I don't think we're in a state that we can—we are or can be ready or can work with them again."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was primed for a 2025 early access launch as the former leadership team claims, Kim said Krafton could probably have generated some sales had it pushed ahead with the original plan, but suggested the title lacks "freshness" in its current guise.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because the fans already had a lot of expectations for the sequel, so there might be some sale that would occur initially," continued Kim. "But because of the lack of the content, the lack of freshness, I believed that the fans would eventually get disappointed. And if that is the case, then actually the future of the franchise would be greatly impacted, was what I was thinking."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/u-s-congressman-calls-out-alleged-ai-usage-in-call-of-duty" target="_self" data-discover="true">U.S. congressman calls out alleged AI usage in Call of Duty</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim's testimony chimes with the below statement provided by Krafton when approached for comment on the trial:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The trial is currently ongoing where we are making the case that the decisions we have made were all about ensuring the best possible experience for our players.
