We work closely with developers to create an environment where ideas can mature without drifting off course, helping teams focus their efforts and make the most of their time and resources."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Three Friends publishing philosophy:">Three Friends publishing philosophy:</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label will employ a publishing model built on three key principles: get in early, build it right; pick the right battles; and guidance, not control.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Co-founder Daniel Kaplan said the label won't rush games to market or attempt to solve problems by simply throwing money at them. Instead, it wants to work hand-in-hand with indies from the outset to help turn strong ideas into standout games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some of the best indie games–like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valheim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deep Rock Galactic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–took the time to refine their core gameplay before scaling up," he added. "That's why we partner with developers early, helping them figure out what makes their game special so they can double down on what works."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Three Friends will start unveiling its publishing slate in spring 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
