"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," they said. "This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The day after the third round of mass layoffs, I walked into the office, and when I tried to open the door to the cafeteria, my badge was denied. For a moment, I wondered if getting breakfast was how I'd find out I was part of that round," added game designer and organizing committee member Ryan Littleton.
