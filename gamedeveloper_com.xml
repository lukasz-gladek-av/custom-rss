Game Developer can now confirm that show organizers are not planning a new Future Class for 2025, and are not planning any programming for future or past honorees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This information was provided to Future Class alumni in a Discord server established to host networking and mentorship opportunities for the program. Previous honorees (some of whom requested anonymity for fear of retaliation) told Game Developer this update was the only message they've received from show management in the last year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Last year we completed our promised cycle of programming for the 2023 FC with our TGA mixer, and did not induct a new Future Class," said Future Class organizer Emily Weir. "At this time, we are not planning a new Future Class for this year and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Weir said the organization will keep the Discord server online for alumni to stay in touch with each other, but said she and Keighley are not actively monitoring the server.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/book-excerpt-the-game-needs-to-change-towards-sustainable-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: The Game Needs to Change: Towards Sustainable Game Design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards has also removed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thegameawards.com/future-class">the Future Class page on its website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, eliminating the definitive record of previous honorees. The 2023 cohort </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">is not named on the program's Medium page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (this may be an oversight, organizers did update the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43570315-The-Game-Awards-Future-Class/">Game Awards Future Class Steam Curator page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with games from the most recent class).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Future Class honorees say they feel &quot;neglected&quot;">Former Future Class honorees say they feel "neglected"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game writer and 2023 honoree (and former Game Developer contributor) Emma Kidwell explained to Game Developer that she repeatedly tagged Weir and Keighley in messages this year asking for updates on the program, only to receive no response. "I felt disrespected as someone who has spoken with Emily in person," she said. "It makes everything feel disingenuous and it sounds and feels like they want us to go away quietly. I know not everyone in the Future Class Discord feels like this, but what do they expect from a group of hurt marginalized folks?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kidwell was one of the honorees </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/dT2t3gJcBiI?si=rs06tdviVODBjfUj">spotlighted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that year's broadcast. Fellow writer and cohort member Anna Webster concurred, saying she wished the organization was "up front" about the state of the program. She said a 2024 networking event before that year's Awards now feels like it was "a last hoorah."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-wizards-of-the-coast-exec-resurrects-canceled-game-at-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Wizards of the Coast exec resurrects canceled game at new studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Malek Teffaha, who was recognized by the group in 2022, told Game Developer that the news "honestly hurt." "I, among others, thought that the Future Class program was not just a platform for celebration, but a means to bridge the gap between industry workers and leaders and help shape the future of the game industry."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm disappointed, but not surprised," said JC Lau, another 2022 alumni. When asked if she felt supported by the organization after organizers said they would determine the program's "next steps" after the 2024 show, she replied "how could they have supported us in the last year if they literally had no contact with us at all?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These sentiments were shared by other anonymous former honorees who spoke with Game Developer, one of whom called Weir's statement "minimal and evasive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards faced internal pressure from Future Class members from 2023 into 2024 on two fronts. Honorees called on Keighley to use the show as an opportunity call for a ceasefire as Israel mounted its invasion of the Gaza Strip following Hamas' October 7 attacks (a United Nations commission described the invasion as "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166201">genocidal</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" in an October 2025 report). Keighley made no statement during the broadcast.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-rolls-out-new-teen-safety-and-moderation-tools-for-guardians" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord rolls out new teen safety and moderation tools for guardians</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-hasn-t-the-game-awards-announced-a-future-class-for-2024-">In 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> honorees lobbied The Game Awards to improve their post-nomination support for Future Class members, saying they received inadequate accommodations at the ceremony and that there was little support for alumni after the spotlight faded away.

The news comes as the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding teens who allegedly suffered grooming and sexual exploitation on the platform, as well as in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/safety/family-center-is-getting-an-update">blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that went live yesterday, the company stated that the update is meant to help guardians stay informed and play a more active role in their teens' online experiences, while also giving teens autonomy to shape their "digital environment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The features, which will roll out over the next week, allow guardians more visibility over weekly activity, including all purchases made, total minutes spent on voice and video calls, and the top five users and servers a teen most frequently messaged and called in the last week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, if a teen submits a report on another user or piece of content to Discord, they'll have the option to notify their guardian. If they do, the guardian will receive an email with the notice, but this won't include the details of the report. Similarly, while guardians can now filter who can DM a teen and whether sensitive content is filtered, the exact content of conversations isn't shared.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/book-excerpt-the-game-needs-to-change-towards-sustainable-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: The Game Needs to Change: Towards Sustainable Game Design</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The new teen safety tools roll out amidst lawsuits pertaining to allegations of Discord being unsafe for underage users">The new teen safety tools roll out amidst lawsuits pertaining to allegations of Discord being unsafe for underage users</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The blog post includes bulleted lists aimed at both teens and guardians, with the former noting that "your voice matters" and that "privacy is protected." For guardians, Discord advises they "play a more active role in safety," to "nurture trust," and "start better conversations" with teens. "We’re focused on making it easier for you to offer guidance, not surveillance," the announcement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in April, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-discord-sued-for-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor">Roblox Corporation and Discord were sued</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over allegations that each company facilitated the sexual harassment and exploitation of a minor across both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord. The lawsuit was filed in California on behalf of an underage plaintiff referred to as 'Jane Doe', taking aim at both platforms for allegedly enabling an accused sexual predator to harass and exploit Doe during interactions on each.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The accused individual allegedly targeted the teen through two games within the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem, sending her messages through the "whisper" function even though her Roblox account "clearly displayed" she was a minor. Over time, the plaintiff was convinced to share her Discord username with the accused predator, leading to conversations on the popular chat platform where she was then coerced into sending sexually explicit images. These events took place over the course of six months.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-wizards-of-the-coast-exec-resurrects-canceled-game-at-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Wizards of the Coast exec resurrects canceled game at new studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back then, Discord declined to directly comment on the case in a message sent via a spokesperson. "Discord is deeply committed to the safety of our users and we take decisive actions when we detect violations of our policies, including removing content, banning users, shutting down servers, and engaging with law enforcement," the company said in a statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/roblox-discord-sued-15-year-old-boy-was-allegedly-groomed-online-died-rcna231049">via NBC news</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the mother of a 15-year-old California boy who took his own life sued Roblox and Discord over his death, alleging the son was groomed and coerced to send explicit images on the apps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit was filed by Rebeca Dallas in San Francisco County Superior Court, accusing the companies of "recklessly and deceptively operating their business in a way that led to the sexual exploitation and suicide" of Ethan Dallas. The son started playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the age of 9 with his parents' approval and with parental controls in place. The alleged targeting by an "adult sex predator" who posed as a child in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> began when he was 12, attorneys for Rebecca Dalas said in a statement to NBC at the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-subsidiary-bad-brain-game-studios-is-shutting-down" target="_self" data-discover="true">NetEase subsidiary Bad Brain Game Studios is shutting down</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversations "gradually escalated to sexual topics and explicit exchanges," and the son was allegedly encouraged to turn off parental controls and move conversations to Discord, the lawyers said. On Discord, the man "increasingly demanded explicit photographs and videos," and threatened the son that he'd post or share the images. The son complied out of fear, the complaint says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lawsuit accuses Roblox and Discord of wrongful death, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and strict liability. It argues that if Roblox and Discord had taken steps to screen users before allowing them to register on the apps, or implemented age and identity verification and other safety measures, the aforementioned events wouldn't have transpired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding Discord specifically, the suit said the platform is "overflowing with sexually explicit images and videos involving children, including anime and child sex abuse material."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A spokesperson told NBC that the platform is "deeply committed to safety," and that it wouldn't comment on legal matters. "We require all users to be at least 13 to use our platform. We use a combination of advanced technology and trained safety teams to proactively find and remove content that violates our policies,” the spokesperson said. “We maintain strong systems to prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming on our platform and also work with other technology companies and safety organizations to improve online safety across the internet."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the new features and moderation tools are helpful on paper, Discord makes the clarification that communication between teens and guardians is a key element throughout the announcement. But as seen with regulations like the UK Online Safety Act, people will always try to bypass verification systems. Less than 24 hours after the act came into effect in July, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-details-how-uk-online-safety-act-will-impact-xbox-players">PCGamer reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that some people were able to bypass Discord's verification by using the face of Sam Porter Bridges in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Stranding 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in Photo Mode.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
