The 'Inappropriate Content' policy prohibits content which 'contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.' The 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2. If you believe we made a mistake, you also have the ability to appeal this decision. You can appeal by replying to this email or creating a private discussion on our Developer Support site. Select 'Epic Games Store' as the topic. 3. You cannot change the title or content to repurpose it for another game. If you choose not to move forward, we'll refund your submission fee for this product."</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/american-company-is-overcharging-japanese-devs-for-japanese-language-fonts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Monotype accused of overcharging Japanese devs for Japanese language fonts</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Santa Ragione explained it immediately appealed the decision through the suggested channels.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-publisher-outright-games-confirms-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">UK publisher Outright Games confirms layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It said the title does not contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour.
