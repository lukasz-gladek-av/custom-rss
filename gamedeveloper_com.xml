Games that list in-game hours in Origin will list the same hours in the EA app. Anything you've saved through Origin’s cloud will also transfer," explained EA.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can't promise that mods will transfer to the EA app. Check with mod creators to see if your content can be transferred."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Origin users with cloud saves enabled will be able to bring over existing save game data "without any action," although EA acknowledged that some titles don't have cloud save capabilities. Players will need to manually transfer those saves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also worth reiterating that the EA app doesn't support 32-bit versions of Windows. That means users will either need to upgrade to a 64-bit operating system or switch to newer hardware to access their games.&nbsp;It's a requirement that could leave some out in the cold.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
