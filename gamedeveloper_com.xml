The response regarding the in-game design, however, wasn't as positive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The criticisms around Anran, a character of Chinese nationality, revolved around what fans call the "same face syndrome," pointing out that character design in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overwatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, especially for East Asian women characters, has gotten homogeneous.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-prickly-protagonist-serves-a-powerful-purpose-narrative-notebook-1" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cairn's prickly protagonist serves a powerful purpose - Narrative Notebook #1</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-kiriko-juno-face-edit-reaction-change-2000666138">Kotaku</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reported last week, Anran's final design ended up being fairly similar to characters Kiriko and Juno, discarding the sharper facial features and longer nose seen on promotional videos. The final result included a much rounder face, with a shrunken-down nose in a similar fashion to Kiriko and Juno.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via her personal </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@askfareeha/video/7604291246865141010">TikTok account</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Fareeha Andersen, the voice actor behind Anran, expressed her disappointment over the character's design differences. "I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for her and the design we ended up with," Andersen says in the video. "Because I think in her comic and the cinematic Elemental Kin, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, 'We are going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing, ransacking media these days,' right? The Ozempic-chic, the 'contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose,' and I think because of that precedence, people feel understandably let down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Andersen added that she shared the community's concerns with the Blizzard team, and encouraged others to do so as well with "boldness and kindness."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yesterday, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overwatch's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021058375337791653">released a video update</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on social media addressing the concerns. "The team is currently discussing what it'd take to make Anran look and feel more like the fierce older sister that we all envisioned her to be," Keller said. "We're so proud of the work that our team has put into Anran and the rest of the five heroes launching in season 1, and we agree that she can be even better if we get this aspect of her right in game."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: Designing the User Experience of Game Development Tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The director added that the team is hoping to make an update to her design at some point during season 1.
