            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-machinegames-wants-players-to-improvise-like-indy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Indiana Jones film series has been an iconic part of pop culture, brimming with a pulp-style sense of action and spirit of adventure. However, there haven't been many modern video games starring the globetrotting explorer, even as the series has undoubtedly inspired other well-known games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's changing with the upcoming</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, helmed by developer MachineGames, who've previously worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein: The New Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The New Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A first-person action adventure game focusing on the events between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> puts a more immersive spin on the escapades of the famed adventurer as he explores tombs and pummels fascists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After playing the opening hours at a recent hands-on event, I got a clearer view of MachineGames' take on an Indiana Jones game, which emphasizes player agency and open-ended exploration. I also spoke with design director Jens Andersson, where he explained how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is all about letting players come up with in-the-moment solutions for the game's challenges. .</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indiana Jones and the change of perspective"><span>Indiana Jones and the change of perspective</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> positions itself as a new adventure during the peak of Indiana Jones' career as an archeologist and occasional college professor. With that conceit, the game focuses on building up the atmosphere and heightened reality for its core combat, stealth, and exploration gameplay sequences, all focused on a protagonist who has to scrape and improvise his way to success. For instance, using Jones' whip was incredibly satisfying for disarming foes or softening up targets to set them up for a finishing blow with an empty rifle used as an improvised club. Many encounters feel like they came out of a movie, and that kind of scrappy and sometimes comedic energy is what design director Jens Andersson wanted to recreate for the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phil-spencer-says-indiana-jones-ps5-jump-good-for-xbox-s-health" target="_self">Phil Spencer: Indiana Jones' PS5 jump good for Xbox's health</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That sense of improvisation is very 'Indy,' isn't it? All of the actions you can do in the game have to make sense for the character, and how we've built it up is something we're very proud of," said Andersson. "Player agency is really important for us, so if an enemy has a gun and he drops it, you should be able to pick it up, and you have a revolver. It's iconic for the character, but in this game, there are many times when you don't want to use it. My favorite part is seeing testers play the game, and there's like a rifle here, and there's a banjo here; everyone picks up the banjo instead because it's just more fun to beat up enemies with, and it also fits the character that you want to play as."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the theft of a mysterious artifact from Marshall College, the titular hero (played by Troy Baker) embarks on a new adventure that'll take him to Northern Africa, Vatican City, and other locales as he uncovers an ancient conspiracy that puts him in the crosshairs of the growing Nazi empire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This setup is very much in line with the film series, but as a video game, there are more opportunities to explore and interact with the characters within the setting. What surprised me most about the opening hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that the game is not a totally linear story experience, but rather, it features some fairly open-ended levels that offer up different ways to acquire knowledge and fight bad guys as Indiana Jones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with the design director, he stated that the developers were not interested in making a standard licensed game adaptation but wanted to dig deeper into an immersive experience that lives up to the classic LucasArts games—such as the seminal 1992 adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fate of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I really love the whole legacy of LucasArts, and we're trying to evoke that sense of adventure from those games," said the design director. "We're doing something very different with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but because we're building off such a legacy of classic adventure games, we have a little more confidence that we can do a modern adventure game as well. It's proven to fit well with the Indiana Jones IP, and now we get to do it on a grand scale in 2024, and that's very exciting for us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Along with being able to walk around the environment to examine notes and artifacts, you can explore to find hidden passages, clues to side activities, and open-ended combat encounters that can be cleared with fisticuffs or stealthily knocking out foes with whatever players can find. There was a strong sense of player agency, and it reminded me of a similar feeling I play an immersive sim like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deus Ex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, Anderson stated they were trying to avoid going too deep into that sort of flexibility, rather focusing more on prioritizing improvisation within sandbox environments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Looking to the past for inspiration"><span>Looking to the past for inspiration</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer MachineGames is mainly known today for the bombastic and surprisingly introspective </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">games. However, the studio is made up of developers who previously worked at Starbreeze, building games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showed more of a stronger pull from the dev's early games, which the design director stated has been a part of the studio's signature ethos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost this kind of muscle memory that MachineGames has been growing consistently from project to project, and many of us have worked together since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> [going back to Starbreeze]," said Andersson. "You build up a way of going about things—which can be hard to do, as game development can feel like turning an aircraft carrier. But what it came down to was that the story needed to come first, and that turned into building the kind of adventure we want to take you on and then building the game features, the pace, and the characters all based around you being Indiana Jones."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feels like a successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, mainly its focus on balancing first-person action and stealth within an immersive story-driven experience. The Chronicles</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s video game adaptation was particularly successful because it didn't directly adapt the film material. Instead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was more interested in capturing the moment-to-moment experience of being an action hero protagonist that was unique to the interactive experience of the video game medium—and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to carry on with that same approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my favorite sections from the opening hours, one that encapsulates the structure of the game well, was the Giza Pyramids, the game's first open sandbox level. While you have a clear goal to get inside a secure tomb, surrounding the ruins are Nazi base camps on the lookout for Jones, along with settlements filled with civilians going about their routines. This section felt very much like an Assassin's Creed-style social stealth sandbox. After gathering intel and scouting ahead with a camera, I had to acquire a disguise or cover to sneak into closely guarded areas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it came to building out these levels, Andersson admits it was a bit risky and scary to design levels with this sort of variation, as the prevailing worry was that players would opt to skip the side activities that help build the world. Still, he reasons that it was worth having them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a bunch of sections that are linear and more story focused, but there are a number of larger areas like the Vatican and Giza that feature a ton of content there that are entirely up to you to engage with it or not," he said.</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From a developer point of view, it's a little bit scary for us to have open-ended levels with side content because we spend so much time on it and players might end up skipping it, but that's also why we have this revisit feature in the game. So even when you complete it you can jump back to earlier chapters and then sort of play the content that you didn't discover the first time around to see the little mysteries and encounters you missed. That's one of the things I'm most happy about with the game, and I'm interested to see what people think about it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="On the next adventures of Indiana Jones…."><span>On the next adventures of Indiana Jones….</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I found most interesting about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it's an action adventure game that's all about getting players to feel resourceful and cunning in their approach to overcoming the odds—like picking up a banjo to clobber fascists. Given the large scope, and the density of its locales, it's an ambitious take on bringing the full Indiana Jones experience to a video game, and I was impressed to see how much detail and variety there was packed into the few areas I got to explore. .</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far, Indiana Jones' big return to the world of video games shows a new side to the character and its pulpy sense of adventure, and for the design director, he believes that the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have already nailed its most important goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's all coming together nicely, we're still working all the way to the end," said the design director. "I'm less scared about the riskier design choices we have made, because we've kind of proven that they work. We have people play through the full game now and I just really love how the story has turned out. The whole point of this game is to get you to feel like Indiana Jones, and that's the thing I feel we most succeeded at."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-they-weren-t-very-good-to-use-panic-halts-development-of-playdate-stereo-dock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Playdate Stereo Dock has been consigned to the realm of dreams (for now) with Panic struggling to realize its vision for the audio accessory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://play.date/stereo-dock/">In an update shared on the Playdate website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Panic said it hopes the Stereo Dock will still launch "someday" but noted its current production plans have been placed on hold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said that birthing the dock had become "almost more challenging than making the Playdate itself," and explained that fraught partnerships and spiraling development costs have left the current iteration of the project dead in the water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What happened? Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time—a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers—could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to another company in another country," wrote Panic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often–rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn't sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic eventually took over the audio production process and hand-tuned the speaker's EQ curves to bolster its output. It also negotiated a buyout of the bluetooth chipset source code with a view to taking over development and improving the user experience, only to be met with some "gnarly code" that made life even more difficult.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hitting pause on the stereo dock">Hitting pause on the stereo dock</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kept pushing forward. We got a number of beautiful finished prototypes, in beautiful final packaging, that look incredible on our desks. But they weren’t very good to use. And if we’re going to ship a product, it has to be, at least, good," continued Panic. "Eventually we hit that painful line: we’re spending more to make this product than we are likely to ever make back from it. And so, we hit pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company still hopes it will have the time and resources to reboot the project in the future, but for now remains focused on Playdate itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-devs-have-earned-over-500-000-through-catalog">sold over 70,000 units of Playdate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since launching the console in 2022, although it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-launch-delayed-until-early-2022-">encountered plenty of challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> along the way. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-launches-catalog-a-curated-digital-storefront-for-playdate">It also launched Catalog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bona fide storefront for Playdate developers and players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-recovers-stolen-playdates-worth-400-000-after-lots-of-detective-work-">retrieved around $400,000 worth of Playdate stock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that vanished in Las Vegas in rather suspicious circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
