Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a bleakly funny look at dieting and eating, exploring a teenager’s life and how every element of it is affected by the strange, sometimes alarming ways dieting makes people look at food. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Jenny Jiao Hsia and AP Thomson, co-directors of the multi-IGF Award nominated title, to talk about the design decisions that went into creating food-based minigames that would explore the challenges and effects of dieting, why they chose to explore this subject with humor, and the steps they took to try to keep their game from triggering those who have complex reactions to dieting and disordered eating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jenny Jiao Hsia, co-director:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Hello, I’m Jenny Jiao Hsia, co-director of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as my capstone project during my undergraduate degree. Years later, I somehow managed to convince a bunch of other talented people to help make this video game with me. I do everything from protoyping the mini-games, storyboarding the narrative, figuring out the visual direction, drawing most of the characters in the game, tweaking the UI, and putting together most of the non-interactive sequences in the unity inspector with custom tools built by AP (Thomson). I guess I also technically lived through the experience of what the game and its story is based on… Does that count? &nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/silent-hill-2-remake-proves-that-remakes-aren-t-the-easy-option" target="_self" data-discover="true">Silent Hill 2 Remake involved finding the 'good enough' and 'not enough' elements of a classic</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AP Thomson, co-director:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Hi, I'm AP Thomson, and I'm one of the co-directors of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> alongside Jenny.

When it was clear that I was not cut out to Become A Doctor, video games somehow became my back up plan. What I mean by that is: during my second year of undergrad, I stumbled into Games 101 (an art history but for video games course @ NYU), met AP, began collaborating on projects, switched my major to Game Design, and the rest is pretty much history.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedic-cheat-sheet-that-helped-build-tactical-breach-wizard" target="_self" data-discover="true">The comedic cheat sheet that helped build Tactical Breach Wizards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I've been making games independently basically since I was in high school?

The two of us went on to make and release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Smooch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (nominated for Student IGF in 2015) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beglitched</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which won the Student IGF in 2016) along with a bunch of smaller projects over the years.

I wanted to play around with the idea that you could attempt to reach your weight loss goals very much like a video game and felt that it could be cool to design consequences for the player to experience that go along with that.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I didn’t.

But while you're here, let me take the opportunity to shout out some specific plugins we made heavy use of: Super Text Mesh is how we got all the bouncy animated text in there, Rewired was an indispensable tool for setting up the gamepad controls, and (this one is kinda obscure) "Advanced Event" by ByteSheep Digital was an essential building block for making various editor tools we used throughout development.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns food and calorie counting into an array of minigames meant to simulate the challenges around dieting and how it can reshape your perception of food. Can you tell us about your process in taking these thoughts around dieting and food and turning them into a minigame? Can you walk us through this process for the design of one of the specific minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Jenny’s dieting is something that places pressure on her life in a multitude of ways and we wanted that represented properly in the game. Key to that is that there’s more than one way to “fail” at dieting: you can eat too much, overshooting your calorie budget, or you can eat too little (or in a way that’s “unsatisfying”) and end up hungry, OR you can counterintuitively do BOTH of those things at the same time. Additionally, eating is something you generally do everyday, so we needed to have a reusable mini game that wouldn’t get old too quickly. The resulting “food </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” mini game mostly emerged from trying to reconcile all those constraints. Each food puzzle piece gets a fake calorie value, but that’s unrelated to how it impacts hunger and craving (which is ultimately determined by the shape of the food) allowing for the aforementioned multitude of outcomes. Anyway, we had to iterate on it a ton before we arrived at the current design [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">].&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores the ways in which dieting attempts to turn food into a mechanical, countable process despite many difficult-to control needs and feelings within the human body. What thoughts went into capturing this battle with the self within the gameplay and the player's limited controls within the minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">There’s definitely a balance between what the player can control vs not control, but more than that, there’s a distinct contrast between systems the player is aware of (i.e. the fake calorie counting system, how hungry Jenny is) and systems that are hidden from the player. We ultimately wanted to trick the player into behaving like teenage Jenny by limiting information in this way. A lot of the hidden systems are built around the “random encounters”. Basically, the way these work is that there’s a big deck of event cards and when the player gets a random encounter it just draws a card randomly from this deck. But actions the player takes can secretly add or remove cards from this deck. For instance, if Jenny goes to bed hungry (with her guts at &lt; 50%), it’ll add a “snack attack” event to the deck where, if it gets drawn, Jenny gives into her craving and eats a big snack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Food-based games are not the entire experience as players must also carry out the protagonist's life and duties as well. What thoughts went into crafting the narrative and turning the main character's various activities into other minigames?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dieting doesn’t end the moment you’re done with lunch. We wanted to explore the ways dieting overlaps with other aspects of Jenny’s life (how she balances it with school work, social obligations, keeping her mom off her back, etc.). To do that, we basically had to simulate the rest of Jenny’s life [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>laughs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]. But even beyond that. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t just about the ways dieting “Consumes” Jenny’s life, it’s about how she jumps from obsession to obsession, piling more onto her plate with each chapter, following an arc similar to the one she followed in real life, so all the non-dieting parts of the game become more and more essential as the story proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's art style? What appealed to you about creating something playful and animated around this serious subject?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The current art style is basically the same art style I used to prototype the original mini-games. Back then, I basically tried to keep the decision-making simple: pick a limited color palette, the pencil tool in Photoshop, a few brush sizes. What mattered to me back then was getting the prototype working so I didn’t have a lot of time to focus on the art side. As I continued developing the game, the look of the art changed, too. I think most artists would agree that as they evolve themselves, so does their art style.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Kelly joined the project to help me out on backgrounds it was a really fun opportunity to see what they could do with my guidelines from the prototyping phase. Since this game has been in development for many years, you can see how the character is drawn in many different styles. It’s hard to stick to 1 style without feeling the need to redo it and I guess we just left my old art in the game alongside the new art styles. I also like to joke that the art looks like it had been made by a whole team of like 20 people when really it’s just 2 artists who have worked on the project for a number of years whose art styles constantly evolved and who felt too lazy to redo the old scenes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, why was it important to you to explore dieting in a darkly humorous way? What benefits and challenges came from looking at this subject with bleak humor?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Life’s depressing. Especially right now. Lots of things look hopeless. Don’t you want to laugh a little and make some jokes before you die? &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is actually one of my pet takes. Basically, I think art that’s completely devoid of humour is also incapable of being serious. Now I don’t mean that everything should be a comedy, exactly, but more that “humor” as “emotional lightness” contrasted with “emotional heaviness” is a really important part of the texture of any narrative. My go-to example here is that even Shakespeare’s famous tragedies (e.g. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hamlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are suffused with humor throughout even if they aren’t “comedies.” Which is just to say, when making something about a serious subject, finding humor somewhere is a very important part of telling a “real” story, for whatever that’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The itch.io store page for this game mentions that this game came about from personal experiences with dieting and disordered eating. What difficulties did you face in exploring these memories and feelings while creating the game? Did you feel that creating art around these experiences has helped you or affected you in any way? Do you have any concerns about how this game may affect others who play it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hsia:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I got more emotional rereading my diary entries about my high school relationship and failing my classes in freshman year than I did about the dieting stuff. I actually feel like, as we expanded the game’s scope, formed an actual team, and turned this personal project into an actual video game, I became less attached to it, emotionally. Regarding my concerns about the subject matter, I don’t want my experiences to trigger other people who are in a bad mental space with food and how they see their body, so we put a content warning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thomson:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We were definitely concerned about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consume Me</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being triggering or upsetting for anyone with a history of disordered eating. For that reason, we put a pretty hefty content warning at the front of the game. We also attempted a few maneuvers to detach it from “real” dieting and disordered eating while still evoking the feeling of those things (Stuff like removing specific weight numbers from the game and replacing “calories” with a fictional unit of energy called “Bites”). That said, we’re well aware that these interventions are insufficient for at least some portion of the audience, so we absolutely won’t begrudge anyone for giving it a pass!&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
