Several Space Ape employees are transferring to the new studio, including co-founder Simon Hade as its CEO and product manager George Yao as head of live games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Per </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/nextbeat-wants-to-make-the-new-guitar-hero/">MobileGamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, 30 staffers currently make up NextBeat.

As such, Hade said they had to "address this immense opportunity, now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BeatStar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">taught us that there is huge per-user monetization potential for music in gaming," said Barnes. "The vast mobile gaming audience and ARPU insights from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Country Star's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> genre-focused approach underscored the need to launch a fully resourced company dedicated to this opportunity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Hade told Music Business, NextBeat is considered more of a "dedicated, music-focused venture" than a mobile game developer like Space Ape. His ultimate hope is for the new studio to "expand into more experiences, games and apps that showcase the inspiration and creativity of our artist partners." Such plans, according to the outlet, potentially include entering the educational tech and mental health sectors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, the focus is on growing out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BeatStar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">into other genres via potential standalone games. Barnes told MobileGamer the next "most obvious evolution" would be nostalgic rock, a la Guitar Hero. Hade showed similar interest in Latin, anime music, and EDM, but said some genres might require "slightly different" monetization approaches.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
