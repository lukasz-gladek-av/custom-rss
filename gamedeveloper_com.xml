The features, which are centered around giving parents a remote way of monitoring and managing their children's activity, include options for playtime, visibility into what kids are playing, approving extra playtime requests, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the app, parents will be notified what game a child is playing in real time via notifications. They can opt to restrict certain games if they so desire, as well as accept or decline a child's request for extra playtime. Parents can also access daily and weekly activity reports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other features are less game-oriented and involve the overall experience of children using a PlayStation 4 or a PlayStation 5. Parents can manage spending activity by adding funds, viewing balances, or even setting a monthly spending limit for a child to make purchases on the PlayStation Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also content filters, which parents can choose and configure to decide on age-appropriate content. The company says that it has included presets that "automatically apply recommended settings for different age groups," but every setting can also be customized individually. In addition, there are also options available to customize privacy settings and how children connect and play via social features.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/testronic-confirms-closure-of-madrid-and-belgrade-studios-affecting-4-point-8-percent-of-the-total-workforce" target="_self" data-discover="true">Testronic makes 4.8 percent of its total workforce redundant, closes Madrid and Belgrade studios</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PlayStation joins Epic and Roblox in the recent parental control moderation tools spree">PlayStation joins Epic and Roblox in the recent parental control moderation tools spree</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recent examples of increased parental control include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/parental-controls-for-nintendo-switch-2-and-nintendo-switch-overview-faq/">the app for the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which parents can use to restrict new features like GameChat, as well as filtering the download and use of certain content. But it's far from the only one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In October 2024, Epic launched two new parental controls in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and UEFN, meant to restrict and track playtime.

In April of this year, the company made it possible for parents to moderate their child's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/parents-can-now-moderate-their-child-s-friend-list-and-block-experiences-in-roblox">friend list and block specific experiences</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Last month, it introduced the "sensitive issues" tag for social, political, and religious experiences (Roblox Corporation's catch-all phrase to describe player-made environments on&nbsp;Roblox). This is meant for developers to label experiences that include mentions or imagery of "issues such as immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, prayer in schools, racial profiling, affirmative action, vaccination policies, and reproductive rights," to name a few.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-heads-to-latin-america-to-help-launch-browser-native-demo-platform-spawnd" target="_self" data-discover="true">Square Enix heads to Latin America to help launch browser-native demo platform Spawnd</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know that adapting to new guidelines can take time, and our goal is always to equip parents with the best tools to manage their children’s experiences while still allowing creators to innovate and express themselves," the announcement read at the time.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
