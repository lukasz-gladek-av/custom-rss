Software sales fell by 27.6 percent over the same period to 70.28 million units.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo noted that hardware and software sales were largely driven by the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during the previous fiscal year, and said the lack of a similarly impactful release this year has caused a decline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, the company stated that sales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made a "good start," with the title shifting 2.58 million units since September. Other sales highlights over the past six months included </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paper Mario Thousand-Year Door</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1.94M units) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1.57M units).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lifetime Nintendo Switch hardware sales have now eclipsed 146 million units, while software sales have topped 1.3 billion units. The console could still usurp the Nintendo DS as the best-selling Nintendo system in history if it can surpass 154.02 million lifetime sales.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo now expects the Switch to sell 12.5 million units during the current fiscal year, having downwardly revised its forecast by from 13.5 million units.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Glancing briefly at Nintendo's digital business, digital sales fell by 26.5 percent to 159.9 billion yen over the past six months. Nintendo said that downturn was mainly due to a decrease in sales of digital software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sales within the company's mobile and IP related business declined by 43.3 percent year-on-year to 31.2 billion yen. Nintendo noted the last fiscal year saw the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which brought huge engagement but in turn contributed to a decline this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consolidated net sales for the first half of the fiscal year decreased by 34.3 percent year-on-year to 523.2 billion yen ($3.44 billion). Operating profit declined by 56.6 percent to 121.5 billion yen ($798.6 million), and profit attributable to owner of parent decreased by 59.9 percent to 108.6 billion yen ($713.8 million).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking that into account, Nintendo has lowered its full-year forecast and expects to deliver net sales of 1.28 billion yen (down from 1.35 billion yen) by March 31, 2024. Operating profit is now expected to total 360 million yen (down from 400 million yen). Net and ordinary profit forecasts remain unchanged.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
