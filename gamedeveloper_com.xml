That group includes major players like Activision Productions, Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts Productions, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, and WB Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Negotiations have been protracted, with SAG-AFTRA previously lambasting those studios for including "alarming loopholes" in their AI proposals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-strike-to-continue-due-to-alarming-loopholes-in-ai-proposals-from-major-game-studios">said SAG-AFTRA in March</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Substantial progress has been made since then, however, with SAG-AFTRA explaining the tentative agreement "puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-spins-up-new-fighting-game-studio-quarter-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Skybound spins up new fighting game studio Quarter Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher applauded the resolve of striking performers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the worldâ€™s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal," she added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA members will remain on strike until a strike suspension agreement is finalized with employers.
