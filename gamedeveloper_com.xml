Now, Fontworks' new US-owned parent company Monotype is charging $20,500 a year for the new plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As reported by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemakers.jp/article/2025_11_18_123775/">Gamemakers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/30/160034.html?">Game*Spark</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and translated by Automaton, this started when Fontworks discontinued its Leading Edge Type Solution plan (LETS) on November 28. In short, the plan allowed developers to integrate Japanese font families, also known as typefaces, into their game builds for around 60,000 yen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some notable examples include Atlus with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Persona 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Etrian Odyssey V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Capcom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Ultimate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Type-Moon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fate/Grand Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, according to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.monotypefonts.com/pages/content/plans-enterprise-subscription">Monotype site</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the standard yearly plan has a cost of $20,500, which is roughly 3.2 million yen. Moreover, the plan can apply to up to 5 applications, but each app can only have "an aggregate of up to 25k registered users."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In summary, as of November 28, Fontworks has ceased supporting further extensions of the LETS license, and it will now be redirecting all existing subscriptions to Monotype's own fonts service.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="US-based company Monotype acquired Fontworks in late 2023">US-based company Monotype acquired Fontworks in late 2023</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monotype acquired Fontworks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.monotype.com/company/press-release/monotype-completes-acquisition-leading-japanese-foundry-fontworks">back in September 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has been one of the most renowned companies for typefaces in the Japanese game industry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-publisher-outright-games-confirms-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">UK publisher Outright Games confirms layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Japanese web and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/KY_creator/status/1993926902277616015">UI/UX designer Yamanaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who's worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Attack on Titan VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Soul Covenant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developers of ongoing live-service games are poised to be substantially affected by the service change. If they decide to switch to a different company, for example, this will require redoing the font integration, which would result in another QA pass and a re-release, something that can be especially taxing for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fate/Grand Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which have been running for over ten years now.
