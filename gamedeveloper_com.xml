Regardless, our registrar's automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Itch.io appears to be back online at the time of writing. The company noted its servers weren't impacted by the situation and said it reached out to iwantmyname to ask "WTF is going on."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Itch decided to hold tight before taking any drastic measures, such as putting up a new domain, but did offer a workaround. "There are implications with third party services that make [switching domains] not a trivial swap. In the meantime, if you know how to tweak your hosts file use: 45.33.107.166," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866049560411566495">the company added in a follow-up post.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you do edit your hosts file, please remember to remove all the lines after domain is restored. Although we typically hold an IP for a while, it can change if we update our back-end infrastructure. If the downtime exceeds 8 hours then we'll likely prioritize deploying a new domain. Hopefully things are able to get sorted out before then."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Brand Shield, Funko, and Itch.io for more information.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
