There were no disciplinary hearings," added Eccles. "The claimants were not given the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing before the decision was taken to dismiss them. Comments relied on by the respondent to dismiss the claimants were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as :covert monitoring."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a statement issued to press following the decision, IWGB described the result as "disappointing" but said it remains confident of securing a positive outcome at a full hearing.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/detroit-become-human-tops-15-million-sales-worldwide" target="_self" data-discover="true">Detroit: Become Human tops 15 million sales worldwide</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have always been clear that Interim Relief is an incredibly high bar to meet as a temporary measure before the substantive tribunal, and it would have been almost unprecedented for a Judge to award this to a group of this size," said an IWGB spokesperson.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That we did not secure an interim relief order means the especially stringent conditions required for this kind of hearing were not met, but does nothing to suggest that Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal when the case goes to trial."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
