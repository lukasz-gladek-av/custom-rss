Netflix and Comcast were the two other major bidders, and last week Netflix seemed to win the race.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Paramount, in an unusual move, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-letter-netflix-comcast-warner-bros-1236442793/">protested the process</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and rallied over the weekend to launch a hostile takeover, offering a $108 billion deal at $30 per stock, slightly ahead of Netflix's $82.7 billion deal. It is also attempting to purchase all of Warner Bros. Discovery, not just the Warner Bros. studio assets.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Axios unearthed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000119312525310708/d92876dex99a1a.htm">a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that showed the Kushner-owned Affinity Partners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and investing groups representing Abu Dhabi and Qatar are backing Paramount's offer.

Games is a lower-priority asset being bandied about between investors. But the reappearance of two parties involved in the purchase of EA is a humbling reminder that these corporate megapowers can upheave the lives of thousands of game development professionals with just a few days and a truckload of financial paperwork.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada is leaving Bandai Namco</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
