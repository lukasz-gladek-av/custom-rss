I broadly enjoyed the game even if I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">found parts of it underwhelming</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Why worry about whether it not it sold well, even if </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=star+wars+outlaws+sales">a seemingly endless array of YouTubers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via YouTube</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet something itched at me. I've had my eye on the game for the last year and kept up with all the moments leading up through its release. I couldn't have done anything to predict its sales prospects but hindsight being 20/20, the variables were all right there. Could this poor performance have been avoided?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps. It's too late for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but its sales struggles make for a fascinating case study for other business and marketing professionals who want their game to sell well. There were three main warning signs leading up to release—all of them variables Ubisoft had plenty of time to react to.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-recovery-from-weak-half-year-to-involve-addressing-polarized-comments-about-company" target="_self">Ubisoft's recovery from weak half-year to involve 'addressing polarized comments' about company</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Star Wars fatigue&quot; is real">"Star Wars fatigue" is real</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the resident Star Wars fanatic at Game Developer, it brings me great shame to report that yes, audiences are experiencing what some are calling "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/fix-star-wars-fatigue-isnt-making-movies-1145847/">Star Wars fatigue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." The underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the recent Disney+ series The Acolyte are the measuring stick we have to work with. For the sake of my sanity, let us again skip past debating the quality of these works, I ultimately liked The Acolyte even if it was flawed as hell.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reason to push aside concerns over quality here is that quality is not the sole marker for success in this series. The Star Wars prequels were widely derided as they released but were all blockbuster hits. Solo: A Star Wars story reviewed well and is a solid little heist film but also whiffed at the box office. Andor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/andor-star-wars-viewers">is the most critically acclaimed entry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi but didn't set the world on fire. Quality doesn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> matter but we have data indicating it's at least a little disconnected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My personal opinion is that quality, marketing strategy, and release timing all mix into the stew here. But whichever one you prioritize, we're left with an unfortunate status quo for Ubisoft: that the Star Wars name wasn't enough to send players rushing to pre-order the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This fact is relevant because for the last few years we've been in an era where supposedly Hollywood and the video game community have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>finally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/story-kitchen-teams-with-dreamworks-animation-to-adapt-video-games-to-film-and-tv">cracked the adaptation code </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">and freed us from the era of terrible licensed games. We've heard so much about flywheels and comarketing and other business words that seem to forget works across both industries are creative works that do not sell like physical products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There've been some big wins, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the warning sign that we may be bracing for big losses too. Execs everywhere will assure you they know the brand name isn't enough, that quality has to be delivered, but let's state plain and clearly, we now have a big data point showing that softening enthusiasm for a series can have a big ripple effect.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The traditional open-world action adventure genre is glutted">The traditional open-world action adventure genre is glutted</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft really needs a wake-up call on this one because CEO Yves Guillemot and other executives have repeated over and over again that the company is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-wants-to-extract-more-cash-from-120-billion-live-service-market">narrowing its focus</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to live service multiplayer games and open world singleplayer games. Great, do what you want, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a big red flag that this strategy is running up against a crowded market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has unfortunately done much of that crowding over the last decade by releasing a buffet table of high quality games across the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry series. If a player says "I'm in the mood for open-world action adventure," they can dive into Ubisoft's own archives and pick up, say, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on sale for $10-$20 and be satisfied through the upcoming release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers are already </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-should-prepare-to-contend-with-decade-old-games-says-owlcat-publishing-head">aware of this phenomenon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and adapting to it, but Ubisoft got caught off guard at a poor moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Ubisoft Massive/Ubisoft</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does this mean all open world games are doomed? No. I think what we're seeing is data that players will drop $60-$70 for new kinds of open worlds, and are champing at the bit for games that shake up the experience. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turned a cult series into a blockbuster bonanza, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> adapted the Dark Souls model for a larger environment. Both games avoided the traditional model of "enter a new area, go through its main quest, explore checkpoints, pick up sidequests, and do small activities where appropriate" and experimented with making exploration a more friction-filled activity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's open world strategy seems to have unfortunately come with a desire to industrialize game production—to create central sets of mechanics that all of its global studios can work with and create slight variations on. It's led to some fun games, but when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> previews started landing our own contributor George Yang </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-ubisoft-s-open-world-model-work-for-star-wars-outlaws">noted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the game's goal seemed to be to adapt this well-worn model to the world of Star Wars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However well it did so (I found this was actually a major high point of the game), it was running headlong into a brick wall of Ubisoft's own making: Ubisoft offered players a type of game that it's already released so many versions of, and it was fair for them to say "I'll wait for it to go on sale."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Star Wars Outlaws"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span> struggled to earn great word-of-mouth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/">well-received by critics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—shouldn't that have boosted the odds of it having strong sales? That positive reception landed in a more complicated media environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would not say </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "bad" word-of-mouth. What I will say is that word-of-mouth was...complicated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, there was the "anti-woke" backlash, but who cares, fifty or so weirdos yelling on Twitter doesn't represent the blockbuster game audience </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ubisoft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so maybe you shouldn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820">bend the knee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to them. But it was certainly in the media ecosystem, so let's count it as a tiny negative for word-of-mouth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Ubisoft Massive/Ubisoft.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, there was the brouhaha over the game's pre-order model. This was fairly justified, as poor communication and high prices were good reason for sticker shock from prospective players. For a hot minute it was c</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-the-hutt-preorder-1851412755">ompletely reasonable</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to interpret access to Jabba the Hutt's mission as being locked behind a paywall. Ubisoft rushed to clarify it, but the damage was done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'd rate this as a high negative point for the game's word-of-mouth because it drove conversation about the game's high price point. That doesn't pair well with the genre glut described above.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally there was the launch window word of mouth. This was a moment where positive reviews had their best chance to boost the game, but content creators and players encountered two issues that shifted the conversation: the game's early forced-stealth sequences, and a game-breaking bug that led to Ubisoft warning PlayStation players to delete their save files.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The difficulty of the early forced-stealth moments (which don't feel great, they seem to be a compromise between other interlocking game systems) became a complaint on social media. It was so prominent that creative director Julian Gerighty </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">admitted in an interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with GamesRadar that it would soon be fixed. Now you have a conversation about a game not being fun, and a director saying a fix will come soon. So you'll just wait to buy it, right? Oh whoops now you've been distracted by another game and...that sale is gone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be clear I don't blame Gerighty here, this was a very difficult needle to thread. Unfortunately the difficulty itself is the issue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's decision to not launch on Steam likely also hurt its ability to spread hype through word-of-mouth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It had a deal with the Epic Game Store," you'd reply. "Surely eager players would have gone there" The most passionate PC users probably did make the jump, but not renegotiating its Epic Game Store deal to support a PC launch here was a bad, bad move. Ubisoft seems to have realized this and is racing to get the game up on Steam and making sure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launches on Valve's platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can debate if the existing (if confounding, to me, personally) distaste for the Epic Store dampened enthusiasm there, but I find skipping Steam to be more about the missed opportunity than the sentiments about its competitor. How do you drive people to wishlist if you aren't on the platform where they build game wishlists? How do you get the algorithmic benefits of the Steam front page? If a friend tells a friend about the game, how do they quickly share it when they're on the same platform?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft should have taken the L here and figured out whatever money they had to give back to Tim Sweeney to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Steam. This wasn't just about missed PC revenue—it was about a missed way for players to engage with the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What should Ubisoft do next?">What should Ubisoft do next?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First: greenlight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and work with LucasFilm licensing to get a broader creative palette to work with. Ubisoft Massive has a team of talented people who know what makes the game work, and they could absolutely build on what shined in the first game and make something better. Remember, it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that put the series on the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second: figure out whoever did see these problems coming from a mile away, and find out why they weren't heard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've referred to "Ubisoft," the corporate entity in this story, but that phrase doesn't capture the nuance of a situation like this. Ubisoft the company is the one that lost out, but it's Ubisoft's workers who make the product, market the game, etc. etc. They're the first ones to know about soft discussion on social media, problems in the game that might dent reception, etc. I'm sure people knew about the problems. I suspect they weren't heard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investigations into Ubisoft's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-allegations-show-the-cycle-of-abuse-and-misconduct-runs-deep-at-ubisoft">alleged culture of sexual harassment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse">revealed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that said culture went hand-in-hand with a power structure that regularly punished anyone who spoke up against leadership. Supposedly, bad actors at Ubisoft have been shown the door. But does the culture they enabled remain?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that Ubisoft Board of Directors is launching a "review" of its practices signals they were badly caught off guard by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' underperforming.
