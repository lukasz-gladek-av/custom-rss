After the trailer debuted, viewers—many of them game developers—began speculating that the game or the trailer are using generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As internet sleuths dug through the business profiles of SuperAuthenti and its executives, some began to wonder if the game might also use blockchain technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company (like a cat) played coy at first, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/catly-announcement-game-awards-2024/">first telling Digital Trends</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it would share more details on the game in 2025. That seems to have changed. Today, a SuperAuthenti PR spokesperson told Game Developer that there is no generative AI in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or its teaser. Additionally, they said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is "not a blockchain game," and there are no </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamestop-s-crypto-plans-collapse-as-retailer-prepares-to-shut-nft-marketplace">non-fungible tokens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (NFTs) or other blockchain currency affiliated with the product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We did not use generative AI to produce the video and the game," the spokesperson said. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculation. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that could produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SuperAuthenti shared a work-in-progress video of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trailer with Game Developer, which contained a number of before-and-after shots showing the pre-rendered kitties bouncing around their playroom.
