Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nuovo Award nominee </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an experience in movement and transformation across stunning,&nbsp;alien worlds that you're tasked with bouncing, flinging, and leaping through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Sam Atlas, the Nuovo Award-nominated game's creator, to talk about its surprising origins in body horror, the thought and design processes that go into shaping the game's colorful landscapes, and the challenges that come from creating visual accessibility features in a game that can sometimes border on visually-overwhelming with its shifting cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Sam Atlas! I did everything except the music and some other sound effects for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which were composed and recorded by DL Salo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is my 4th standalone game and the follow-up to the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Space Hole </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trilogy. Before my own games, I made mods especially on the Source (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) engine (I generally made level pack style single-player mods).&nbsp;I've got a background in general software, so I approach game development from a holistic/ synergistic approach (i.e. mix tech and design).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It started as a vague project called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flesh</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was going to be more of a horror game about an organism seeking humanity through the mechanical accumulation of human parts.&nbsp;It was a brain in a void, and the game would have been in first person, with real-life footage of hands/organs as the tools you use. These tools would be used to, for example, paddle your hand to swim the psychic-brain around.&nbsp;Accumulation and the imitation of humanity were themes; but it was more body horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity, chatGPT, VSCode, Blender (lightly for certain 3d), Unity ProBuilder (the majority of custom 3d meshes), Paint.NET, Davinci Resolve, Audacity, and my camera phone! I take videos/photos of natural patterns, such as waves or light reflecting on water, or fire, and loop those in the video editor (by flipping and tessellating the videos).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores many different forms of movement as you explore its dizzying visual landscapes. What thoughts went into creating the various ways players could evolve to move around? What made a form of movement feel interesting to you to include in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One core design idea for the game was "a platformer where every pickup extends your range."&nbsp; The main design idea here was to begin stumbling—a speck of dust or a pebble rolling/shambling—and by the end to be a maximally-empowered platformer (i.e., fling yourself, drive up walls, hang in the air indefinitely etc). So, a lot of the form design derived from trying to find a middle ground between "can go anywhere" and "can only tumble along the ground."&nbsp; The name "Extreme Evolution" alludes to this: starting at the most basic (a clunky, oblong egg) and eventually the most obscene (Deity, a hovering orb that spits out projectiles that seek pickups and count as part of your body). "Drive to Divinity" is also a reference to this, and another literal description of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Movement often comes with unique shapes that feel alien, but also convey some of their capabilities to the player through shape and form. What thoughts went into making movement feel somewhat clear while also keeping things mysterious?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this, I think the key is to make the rules of the world consistent and to use visual cues to explain how objects interact. Furthermore, I have a short flavor text for each form, which, when combined with its name, was intended to convey some efficient expectation to the player. For example, "Cor" is "the oblong car," and it is both a corrupted motorcycle and a corruption of the word "Car."&nbsp; But as is the case in nature, the "Car" remains around in the world as well. I wanted the world to have a sense of logic and consistency to it, as well as a mix of earth-references and references that seem alien.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You put a great deal of thought and work into the visuals of your games, crafting this sense of moving through higher realities of color and shape. What feelings were you looking to evoke in the player with the cosmic visual work in this game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal is to create an environment that you haven't seen before. I think the fun of the game is a repeating cycle of "what's over there?" and following intuition. I want to encourage the player to feel in control of their experience. I make games essentially by playing through them extremely slowly, making the levels in front of me as I go. So, whichever game I make tends to represent my feelings during development, or the feeling that I wanted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into birthing this whole new visual cosmic universe? How do you craft whole worlds to platform in that capture this sense of being otherworldly and alien through your use of color and shape?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iteration, willingness to cut ideas/areas, and gradually narrowing the focus of my work as a level progresses. It takes many, many coats of paint (and sometimes major cuts) to make sure each zone has a good feeling.&nbsp; For this game, the whole overall thing was "playable" a year before release in an alpha form, but everything went through major revisions following that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basically, I become more focused/editorial as I get deeper into development, but every level starts with some kind of simple idea (for example, "Thyroid" was conceived as "Jump," a delta where you are given many exits to choose between; the name "Thyroid" was chosen due to the geographical notion of the thyroid as a gateway to the body from the head). Sometimes, the name of the level is a remnant of that original idea and separate from the actual level (which sometimes is funny, so I leave it in). Often, levels become most extreme at some middle point in development—the most visual elements, the most pickups, etc. Then, over time, like a sine wave, I cut/uncut stuff until it feels right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face in creating visuals that can be so powerful they border on overwhelming? What is it like to pore over these visions as you weave them together while developing the game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I like to develop the game intuitively, so the border between "too much" and the right amount is always revealed only by the end of the project (but really, many years after).&nbsp;I also will sometimes revert to an earlier version but keep a single element from the newer (cut) revision, resulting in a hybrid that is mostly the old but with some specific improvement. I also have learnt to be sensitive (and un-offended) to the way people respond to visuals; people respond in a very specific way (they avoid playing) if it's making them nauseous, so I do mix my own feelings with the (sometimes visceral) player reactions. If you go too far everywhere, it also reduces the sense of change when entering spaces that are more or less intense.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have put in some systems to help players who may have difficulties or health issues that are affected by the game's visuals, but they cannot be turned all the way off. What ideas go into balancing the need to protect the player with preserving the vital visual style of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think of accessibility as a natural tool to make games better. I think it's absolutely a balance; another element of this issue (ensuring people don't have a physically painful experience playing the game) is to represent the game as accurately as possible in marketing materials. And, while you can turn lots of the effects off, there is a limit because I wanted to make sure every version of the game at least emphasized the separation of foreground and background.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the Mod menu (unlocked about an hour into the game) you can go further into untested effects. However, because of the large amount of complex color correction, there are cases where turning an effect off might result in the ground and sky being too close in color. The major effect which produces nauseous feelings in my game is using uncleared buffers; this results in pixels which can change each frame as their behavior becomes so unpredictable. To balance this, I've tried blurring in the past, but now I use blur (and motion blur) as sparingly as possible because I find it tends not to be worth its nauseousness-to-budget, so to speak.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The representation of nothingness as infinitely-complex static feels too perfect and fitting for the game and the game's themes (nothingness/everythingness) to not be on by default in my mind, but I also have no qualms about the idea that some future playerbase might prefer it off. Ownership and setting your own goals is an intention of the game. I mostly focus on making sure the geometry of the level still reads and making sure the default modes reflect what I personally prefer when enabling accessible graphics options. I'm happier with how I've managed the accessibility features in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Hole 2020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about for future projects.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nc-america-ceo-hopes-the-industry-and-her-company-is-on-upswing-after-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the nascent period of online games in the late '90s and 2000s, publisher NCSoft and its massively multiplayer online role-playing games have been a mainstay. The company's one significant edge against competitors like Blizzard Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was its focus on bridging the divide between Western and Eastern MMORPG audiences with a cross-continental portfolio including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Aion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As live service games have become increasingly high risk for the industry, the long-running publisher sees a path through the turmoil, with its sights on company expansion. In 2025, the publisher intends to double down on its live service business in the wake of layoffs and restructuring to reaffirm its position on the global market—all with a focus on its MMORPG pedigree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current CEO of NC America Jeonghee Jin said she hopes the industry—and the company—is on the upswing after laying off workers. According to her, NCSoft is recalibrating its approach to supporting Western game developers, with the hope of not repeating mistakes from years past.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a new NCSoft">Building a new NCSoft</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While NCSoft has maintained steady success with legacy titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company has struggled across other ends of its portfolios. During the 2010s, NCSoft made efforts to expand in the United States, but that ultimately led to the shuttering of the sci-fi MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wildstar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and its developer Carbine Studios, and the online music-rhythm game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fuser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from developer Harmonix (now owned by Epic Games). In recent years, it's laid off workers and underwent a general restructuring in late 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The last two years have been pretty bad for many game companies, including NCSoft, but honestly, I've seen cycles like this in the game business, and most other businesses," said the CEO. "We are always seeing these ups and downs, and especially right after the COVID lockdown period. We're now seeing a lot of layoffs and cancelations of promising projects, but I'm still actually very hopeful because I feel like we're kind of at the bottom of that cycle, and that a rise is happening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, Jin was named CEO of NC America following her time as the former senior vice president and CEO of Pearl Abyss America, where she helped expand the reach the South Korean MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Desert Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Since she joined the company, NCSoft has made numerous investments within European and Korean development studios for new IPs, including a new first-person shooter from Moon Rover and an RPG known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breakers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from Vic Game Studios, respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin acknowledged the publisher's past misfires, saying she joined the company with the hope of learning from its mistakes. "When I joined, I had a lot of thoughts on where we can do things with NCSoft," they continued. "This publisher has such a rich history within the MMORPG space across the Korean and western markets, and that makes it such a unique company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going back to the '90s, NCSoft was one of the first MMORPG developers, and they've done a lot of experiments with trying to break through to other markets. Generally those titles have been doing great mostly in Asia, but to a lesser degree in western regions, which we want to work on more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There have been a lot of investments with NCSoft over the years, and a lot of experiments, and some of them went great, but others not so much. I think a lot of people only remember failures, but there are a lot of achievements as well which definitely paved the way for other Korean companies and Asian developers who wanted to go global. I feel very optimistic now as we invest more within the western market, which we see a growth opportunity for."</span></p><p>Image via NCSoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NCSoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now in 2025, Jin is heading up the new NCSoft office in Southern California following a notable restructuring effort. According to Jin, her current vision for NCSoft is a publisher that releases modern games that are more approachable for wide audiences—which includes the online shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project LLL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NCSoft will also lean into its steady successes within online live service games, which they still see growth potential in. Along with titles from Moon Rover and Vic Game Studios, a recent investment in Mistil Games and their upcoming third-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Takers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show how NCSoft is heading into new territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's good for us to have more diverse genres in the portfolio, and with NCSoft America and the Western divisions, we are now in a better position to bring these titles to a broader audience."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding success within the live service model">Finding success within the live service model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry within recent years has been a volatile and challenging space for developers to operate in. With record layoffs and studio closures, studios are also juggling ballooning development budgets and expectations for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think there are still a lot of successful titles right now, and they're still being loved by so many players, and not really having a really negative impact on their communities," she continued. "So I see a lot of bright and some dark sides of the business right now. But I know we're going to see that rise once again, and we'll do it all together as industry comrades. I'm also really looking forward to all the projects that we are working on, so I'm very positive and optimistic about the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin explained that NCSoft still thinks its central publishing role supporting a wide variety of studios has advantages over being a studio supporting one game. Live service games need "happy" players, and tracking player behavior can be a task that's too big for one dev team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be very stressful...for any publisher and developer working on live service games, they hear a lot of harsh comments and feedback all the time," she said. "But that's why a core publisher exists for [live service games]. A really good team has to support that and figure out how to engage the community and guide the game over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For online games, the communities they foster can be a driving factor in future success. Along with maintaining a successful launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> NC America also has the western launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blade &amp; Soul Neo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a visual and gameplay remaster of its popular martial-arts action MMO—aims for a "nostalgic" trip back to a classic MMO experience for long-time fans, and the type of game that NCSoft plans to spotlight in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm feeling great about the current projects we are working on, like one potential project we are preparing just made me feel very optimistic about the future of NCSoft's business in the West, and I feel I have a clear vision about how I want to run the business at this point," said Jin. "In the first few months while I was here, I did a lot of studying and reflecting on the history of NCSoft—what did well and what didn't, and I talked to as many people as possible at the headquarters to figure out their perspectives about the Western regions and the growth opportunities there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm in a very good place where I can plan confidently for our next projects—I feel good for what's ahead."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
