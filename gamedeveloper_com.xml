Until now, Steam has largely not received its due attention as a de facto major social network where its users engage in many of the same activities expected of a social media platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[...] It is reasonable to question how committed Valve is to effectively implement and enforce Valve's own, self-created Conduct Policy for its users, in light of the 1 million Steam user accounts and 100,000 user-created groups glorifying hateful ideologies that ADL found."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Warner stated that "lax enforcement of the letter of user conduct agreements" on other social networks, combined with a "seeming reluctance" by those companies to embrace the spirt of those same agreements, has elevated harassment and abuse. With that in mind, he claimed Valve should be doing more to protect users, rather than leaving them vulnerable to harassment, intimidations and ridicule.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As Black Friday and the holiday buying season approaches, the American public should know that not only is Steam an unsafe place for teens and young adults to purchase and play online games, but also that, absent a change in Valve's approach of user moderation and hate type of behavior that it welcomes on its platform, Steam is playing a clear role in allowing harmful ideologies to spread and take root among the next generation," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Valve must bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards or face more intense scrutiny from the federal government for its complicity in allowing hate groups to congregate and engage in activities that undoubtedly puts Americans at risk."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Warner has requested Valve and Newell answer a series of questions before December 13, 2024, so he can better understand how the company is approaching content moderation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/4/84b68bc0-e6dc-4ecc-a148-592f9e7a4d1b/F48B5B4549C67C9692B2A787F7A485C57AF2BD64A1DE1154CFE274C3327A6096.241115.warner-valve-steam-content-letter-final.sign-1-.pdf">You can read the full letter here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
