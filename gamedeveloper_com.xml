It was apparently granted an extended grace period after Santa Ragione appealed the decisionâ€”even though those appeals were ultimately denied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio has decided to make the title available free-to-download on the platform for the next 10 days to ensure as many people as possible can experience it before it is yanked from digital shelves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva said Apple has so far failed to provide an adequate explanation as to why the award-winning title has been marked for removal. "Despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification, Apple has not provided clear justification for this removal, citing only their policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated,' despite the game being fully functional and compliant with current technical standard," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products. Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-tried-to-choke-us-from-the-start-secret-6-madrid-workers-slam-owner-testronic-ahead-of-impending-closure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'They tried to choke us from the start:' Secret 6 Madrid workers slam owner Testronic ahead of impending closure</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form&quot;">"This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After his initial email appeal was quashed, Riva explained his second appeal resulted in a phone call with a member of Apple's team who instructed them to file another appeal via a different form. In that instance, Riva underlined that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheels of Aurelia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "continues to function properly and meets all expectations of users, including full compatibility with Game Center and the latest screen ratios."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also emphasized that certain video games and other creative works "do not inherently require continuous updates beyond ensuring functionality and compliance with current regulation and technological requirements."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Updating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheels of Aurelia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at this stage would demand very significant resources solely to refresh engine and SDK elements without providing meaningful enhancements to user experience or artistic value," he added in that second appeal, the contents of which were shared with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For smaller development teams, such forced updates represent a substantial financial burden, diverting limited resources from new projects or critical ongoing work. Alternatively, removing these titles from the App Store impacts developers' portfolios and visibility, ultimately affecting their sustainability and recognition in a very competitive industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva then received a message explaining that Santa Ragione's appeal was being evaluated. He claims it was rejected five minutes later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva feels Apple's approach to delisting titles it has deemed "outdated" leaves smaller developers at risk of needing to continuously update projects to meet vague demands, costing them time and money that might otherwise be spent supporting other projects or kickstarting new endeavours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, he says Apple's "dominant position in digital distribution makes those practices especially troubling" and reinforces the importance of diversified ecosystems. "We commend recent EU regulations designed to prevent monopolistic behaviors, fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether the situation will impact Santa Ragione's plans to support Apple platforms moving forward, Riva said the team was already discouraged by the company's shift away from human curation and questioned whether it is actually committed to helping game developers succeed.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ousted Unknown Worlds founders, former CEO sue Krafton for breach of contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form," he added.

The shuttering will purportedly result in 42 employees eventually losing their jobs. The news comes less than three years after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.testroniclabs.com/testronic-owner-catalis-expands-its-service-offering-into-art-and-game-development-through-the-acquisition-of-secret-6/">Testronic purchased Secret 6</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which also has an office in Manila, for an undisclosed fee. To date, Secret 6 has worked on a litany of notable projects including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part IIâ€”Remastered</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo IV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the days since we published that report, Secret 6 Madrid employees issued a scathing press release with backing from the Spanish labor union CGT that accuses Testronic of sentencing the Madrid office to a slow death by neglecting to provide any contract work, dismissing their CEO in December 2024 and failing to hire a replacement, and outright ignoring the team's repeated requests for support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Testronic acquired Secret 6 at the end of 2022, with the promise of providing the necessary support to help it grow in the outsourcing market," reads the press release. "Two and a half years after the acquisition, the Madrid studio has not received a single contract from Testronic. The employees suspect that the initial intention was to drain the studio of its content and offshore the work. Along with CSVI and CGT union, the workers believe may be no valid reason for the redundancy plan."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid and CGT allege that Testronic wants to shutter the studio so it can focus on Secret 6 Manila, where they claim working conditions are "much more precarious and wages much lower." Those factors, they say, will enable Testronic to commit "more unchecked labor exploitation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As soon as the Madrid studio was acquired, the new leadership failed to take on the necessary responsibilities and tasks for client acquisition, a role that had been effectively managed by the previous CEO, who was dismissed after fulfilling his sales contract," continues the release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Secret 6 Madrid is dedicated exclusively to art development for video games and lacks a department for actively seeking new clients, as it was assured that this responsibility would fall entirely on Testronic and its sales department. In this way, the Madrid studio was left to survive solely on the contracts it had maintained due to its strong reputation with previous clients.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ousted Unknown Worlds founders, former CEO sue Krafton for breach of contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given these circumstances, the managers of the Madrid studio tried to coordinate with Testronic's sales team to develop joint strategies that could bring new contracts to the studio. The proposed meetings never took place, and the email exchanges on this matter led nowhere; on several occasions, there was no response from Testronic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the face of those issues, Secret 6 Madrid's management team claims it actively sought to attend industry events and contact studios directly to secure contracts and in turn their future. Testronic allegedly refused those requests and even prohibited Secret 6 from directly contacting potential clients.&nbsp; What's more, the Madrid team alleges that only Secret 6 representatives from Manila were allowed to travel to events, leaving them unable to effectively promote their arm of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the press release, Testronic also told the Madrid team to raise their fees to increase profit margins "despite repeated warnings from the Madrid managers that this decision would harm the studio and could lead to the loss of contractsâ€”something that, in fact, occurred with two clients the studio had been collaborating with for several years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Testronic's response was that if the clients did not agree to these price hikes, the contracts should be terminated immediately, even if this meant not having other projects for the Madrid studio to work on. These price increases were entirely unrealistic and risky, given the current state of the video game market, which is why workers and unions consider it to have been a 'suicidal decision' in every sense."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/exploring-sabotage-studio-s-strategy-for-balancing-creativity-and-sustainability-game-developer-podcast-ep-50" target="_self" data-discover="true">Exploring Sabotage Studio's strategy for balancing creativity and sustainability - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 50</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secret 6 Madrid claims it proved to be "financially solvent" in terms of production capacity and earnings despite those challenges, and suggests it has a number of clients who wish to continue providing the studio with work.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it&quot;">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Four members of the Secret 6 Madrid team, including two studio managers, have now spoken to Game Developer to discuss the impact of their fight against their parent company. All four sources chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, but explain how Testronic effectively abandoned Secret 6 Madrid as soon as it was acquired by the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From day one it was quite clear what sort of intentions they had," said one source. "It's that they wanted [to expand their] presence in the Asian market. [...] That's the reason we were feeling a little bit afraid, because we could see that our offices in Manila were more attractive to them than usâ€”even when the strong arm [of the business] is here in Madrid."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say Testronic's treatment of Secret 6 Madrid is like purchasing a plant and then refusing to water it, and emphasize that the only person at the company who was searching for new contracts under the Testronic banner was their former CEO. We're told how Secret 6 Madrid has received very little support or contact from their parent company, but that their first meeting with a Testronic sales exec made it clear they were "selling smoke" and had no intention of nurturing the Madrid studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, multiple sources claim that when Testronic did eventually hire a sales person to assist the studio, they brought in someone who "didn't know the difference between 3D and 2D art." Given Secret 6 Madrid specializes in art outsourcing, it was a confusing decision that left the studio high and dry. "They couldn't sell art, basically." adds another source. "But that's what they told us: 'hey, you've got this person in case you want to use them.' But they didn't do anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source claims that, the day after Testronic told staff Secret 6 Madrid would be closed, the studio was approached by a client who wanted to sign a contract worth a purported â‚¬800,000, but that Testronic remained entirely focused on dismantling the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those aforementioned price hikes, one person says that Testronic didn't advise the Madrid office to raise its prices but rather mandated the move. There was no room for discussion or compromise. "[We were told] 'you are going to raise the rates for every single client by at least 15 percent, and if they say no you are going to stop working for them immediately.' This is not a real strategy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source describes that approach was like being forced to play poker without the ability to do anything but go all in on each hand. "It was really, really dangerous for us," they add, noting that relationships with some clients turned sour as a result.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has culminated in a dire situation that has left Secret 6 Madrid workers fighting for their livelihoods. In an ideal world, the team want to continue developing video games under the Secret 6 bannerâ€”but given the precarious situation they have been placed in are also attempting to secure solid severance packages in tandem with CGT.&nbsp;Right now, they haven't ruled out striking if discussions stall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The first thing we want is to continue doing our labor. To continue being able to create games, and to continue having this amazing team of people creating games in the future," adds one source. "They don't want to let us continueâ€”and they are saying 'no, we are going to close you down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another employee agrees and says Testronic has never made a "serious" proposal that will enable the team to continue working. All four explain that watching Testronic slowly put their studio to the sword over the course of years has massively impacted their wellbeing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For me personally it has been awful," says one person. "You could actually see that we were running out of projects for a long time and we couldn't do anything. [...] It has been exhausting, because at some point we realized that we were trying to save something that someone else had decided should be left to die. That was very hard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I feel like they took the opportunity for us to be able to keep growing as a team, and that really hurts because there are exceptional people here with a lot of talent and we are very close as a team. I admire every single person here that's in the office and all of our colleagues that are online, and they are great. The humanity that's here is exceptional."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source feels Secret 6 Madrid wouldn't be facing closure if Testronic had "wanted to do their job" and claims that lives are being upended because their parent company has abandoned their responsibilities. Such is the feeling of injustice at the decision to shutter Secret 6 Madrid that at least one member of the team has traveled from another region in Spain to Madrid "to fight and sit on the negotiation table."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I fight for my team and my studio because I believe that we are worth it," they say. That passion is evident no matter who speaks upâ€”although one source explains their frustration has now turned to anger. "They tried to choke us from the start of this whole processâ€”and this is very very frustrating," they add. "[I'm feeling] both stress and fear. A mixture of emotions and feelings, but most of it is rage. We are raging about this whole redundancy process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The real kicker, according to one person, is that Testronic "will most likely get away with it." As is so often the case when major conglomerates and corporations make sweeping cuts in the name of sustainability, growth, or whatever other buzzword they roll out to appease investors, the executives making those decisions are left unscathed and often escape accountability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of Testronic, we have reached out multiple times to the company since word of the closure began spreading on social media. So far, we haven't heard back. One source explains they "would love" to hear what the company has to say publicly on the matterâ€”not least because it seems the firm has been decidedly unresponsive when discussing the situation internally.&nbsp;"To be honest, I think they know what they have been doing is wrong," they add. "[But] it's quite clear they don't want to talk."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has once again reached out to Testronic for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
