The team was tiny—with only an artist, programmer, and producer—so they were planning for the Eldritch fishing horror to be story-light.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can't really make a narrative game," read a quote by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> programmer Joel Mason on an early slide in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Yarn Spinner: Building Narrative with Open Source talk at the Game Developers Conference. Jon Manning, narrative technologies lead at Yarn Spinner, spoke about how the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team used the program to develop what turned out to be one of the best narrative games of 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made use of Yarn Spinner, an open source dialogue tool used by a number of award-winning games, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Night In The Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It helped Black Salt Games develop the majority of their narrative structure once they discovered that players loved the creepy lore of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Islands of Grief">Islands of Grief</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The original plan was that each of the islands in the archipelago that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is set in represented the Kübler-Ross stages of grief," Manning said. "Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The characters at the islands represented these different stages of grief. The fishmonger on greater marrow represents depression."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-star-wars-outlaws-poker-style-mini-game-helped-to-define-its-tone" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Star Wars Outlaws' poker-style mini-game helped to define its tone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this idea was eventually abandoned midway through development, it helped solidify the structure of the story and shaped many of the characters found in the 10 hour base adventure. Black Salt Games began writing out their story in a word processor, but found that they would need to work directly within the engine once they created a massive amount of dialogue.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now, dialogue systems are deceptively complicated. I happen to think that they are probably the second most complex system in a game, and certainly the most complicated user facing system," Manning said. "[Many people] write out lines in a spreadsheet, but [don't realize] that if you do that, then you're kind of not quite seeing the larger collection of gotchas that exist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Manning brought up how writing the entirety of your game in something like Microsoft Excel or Word could lead to a number of issues with localization, asset management in relation to specific lines, and event synchronization. Yard Spinner is a tool meant to streamline and make those problems easier to resolve.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hook, Line, and Sinker">Hook, Line, and Sinker</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gameplay revolves around the player as the protagonist—a new fisherman that has come to the archipelago—sails to different fishing spots and islands, talks to the characters there, and completes tasks for them. The story is told primarily through the dialogue in these conversations. Other narrative vehicles exist in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">messages in a bottle, quest descriptions, etc—but those were not hosted in Yarn Spinner.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedy-first-approach-to-thank-goodness-you-re-here" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We write good stuff in the pub:' the comedy first approach to Thank Goodness You're Here</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Black Salt Games had specific guidelines for successful dialogue within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">They didn't put more than 4 or 5 text boxes in front of the player in a row, they limited each text box to 3-4 lines, and set out that each bit of text should do one of three things:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tell the player what they're doing</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Advance the story or world</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yarn Spinner helped the team take that text and integrate it with other systems within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Lines would have different prompts and commands that brought up a variety of features to pair with dialogue. Names prompted a specific character portrait to come up, colors would highlight certain words based on importance to the player, and while there was no voice over, a command would prompt characters to make a variety of noises.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The whole idea behind Yarn Spinner is you write a screenplay and then the game reads and interprets it, and then sends content into the game," Manning said. The way that it does this is via a mechanism that we call the dialogue view."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/pentiment-director-explains-how-going-all-in-on-fonts-helped-elevate-the-medieval-detective-rpg-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pentiment director explains how going all-in on fonts helped elevate the medieval Detective RPG.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the beauty of Yarn Spinner is these prompts and commands are able to connect the dialogue with so many other narrative elements. It could track how long the player had gone without talking to a certain character, prompting a specific response when that character finally pops up on their screen again. It could trigger visual elements—like a lightning strike—in the background for dramatic effect at exactly the right time. It also lets the developers add and remove other elements by editing text in Yarn Spinner, making iteration a simpler process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Seeing the dialogue happen inside the overall gameplay exposed a lot of issues, because seeing it happen live just made it reveal weird connections or janky expositions in a way that you simply don't see when you're reading a linear document," Manning said. "Which meant that iterating on that content was absolutely essential [and] having a tool that lets you iterate quickly and reduce iteration time was really important for the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My first formative memory of Valve was in 2009, when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Left 4 Dead 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was released on consoles and PC. At just barely sixteen years old, I didn’t think about the developer who made the game, or how long Valve had been shaping the lives of players. I just knew I really enjoyed hunting zombies, and that the game itself was amazing to play.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2025, Valve carries a completely different weight, as the maker of the Steam Deck, and some of the most iconic online games of our time. From </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Portal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve has challenged and shaped the game industry, but its success was hard-earned, as Monica Harrington explained at GDC 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Harrington, the retired CMO of Valve, explained how the company got its start in the late 1990s. While some of this story has been given via Mike Harrington and the Valve documentary Half-Life, Harrington dived into elements of the company’s inception with more detail, including the steep costs that can come with throwing everything into a startup company.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Success Can Mean Starting Over">Success Can Mean Starting Over</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Harrington became involved with Valve, she was actively working in the marketing department of Microsoft’s software and growing games department. She had a vision of what the future could hold, and how the consumer games market would grow. She was a driving force behind iconic Microsoft products, including Microsoft Office and the original Flight Simulator.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-microsoft-ea-and-others-unite-to-make-accessibility-messaging-a-priority" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo, Microsoft, EA and others unite to make accessibility messaging a priority</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, when Mike Harrington became involved with and helped found Valve, Monica Harrington found herself pulled into the fray by her then-husband’s venture. Valve was picked up by Sierra Entertainment, and production began on the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Harrington explained that the path was grueling. They quickly tapped the bottom of their resources, and she found herself struggling to balance her work at Microsoft while keeping up with Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team was stretched thin, with every member making sacrifices to see Valve succeed. That might be tough to believe given the publisher (and storefront)'s status in 2025, but the beginning was indeed humble.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Harrington explained that, as she got to know her team, she became painfully aware of what was riding on the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It wasn’t just about shipping a good game, it was about honoring the team that had built it, and respecting the families and livelihoods at stake if they didn’t manage to recoup costs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of this, Harrington and the Valve team decided to scrap their first attempt at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, starting from scratch after being unhappy with where the game was headed. This added extra pressure and anxiety around deadlines, but the choice likely secured the success </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enjoyed when the reimagined version was launched in 1998.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-boss-says-the-streamer-must-seek-to-cause-disruption-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix Games boss says the streamer must strive to cause 'disruption'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fighting For Success In a Flawed System">Fighting For Success In a Flawed System</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Harrington didn’t just face troubles with development and deadlines, however. She quickly realized that Valve had bigger problems when dealing with Sierra Entertainment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a resounding success, with fans and reviewers celebrating its groundbreaking gameplay. Harrington was prepared to tackle a “game of the year” edition for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> following awards and accolades when Sierra announced it was pulling all marketing for the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“We hadn’t come close to making back our money, and with that move, we never would,” Harrington explained. She marched back to Sierra and demanded they continue to push the marketing. At this point, Harrington had walked away from her job at Microsoft, and she and her whole team were completely dependent on the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s sales.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I left the office that day not knowing what Sierra would do,” She said. Despite her fears, Sierra agreed to do the game of the year marketing push. Doing so turned it into a “marketing juggernaut”, with sales skyrocketing as the new edition hit the shelves.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-prioritizing-ai-workflows-enhanced-performance-and-expanded-platform-support-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity prioritizing AI workflows, enhanced performance, and expanded platform support in 2025</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Madness Behind The Method">The Madness Behind The Method</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Valve’s story sounds romantic and empowering, several elements struck a chord with me and left me wondering if the mentality behind the mega-company’s inception was actually inspiring.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At one point, Harrington recalled when a member of the Valve team needed to step away for a wedding. It wasn’t something luxurious or planned, but an emergency to keep the person’s partner from being deported.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She explained that the team was so desperate they couldn’t spare the person. Instead of granting the leave and working around the situation for the mental health and safety of the team member, Harrington recalled that they instead threw a wedding ceremony in the office.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To some, this might sound cute, but to me, this illustrates a deeply unhealthy mentality that has been built into the foundation of the industry. Developers of all disciplines have been caught by messages (implied and otherwise) that sacrifice is the key to success. We’ve all put in long nights, skipped vacations, gone in sick, or pushed ourselves to burnout to meet the demands of an industry moving at warp speed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Harrington told this story, and continuously mentioned the demands she had for her team, I couldn’t help but wonder, "Was it worth it?" Valve’s success today has brought so many players memorable titles, but do we remember or talk about the devs and programmers who gave up chunks of their lives so those games could exist?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One thing is clear, after listening to Harrington: the sacrifices she and her team made were the key to Valve’s success.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, I’d be curious to know if she and all those original team members truly felt it was worth it.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.
