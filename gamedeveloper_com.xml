And not just the dozens or hundreds of workers it takes to make great games come to life—around the show, you could feel the excitement for every other game nominated that evening.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That excitement was so palpable that we happened to overhear Bethesda Softworks creative director Todd Howard explaining to IGN reporter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/person/duckvalentine">Rebekah Valentine</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that one of his personal favorite games of 2024 was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>EA Sports College Football 25</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Howard was explaining that it takes so much great, often unseen work to make great sports games, which often cater to an audience that only plays that particular genre (given that Howard's enthusiasm for Bethesda's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wayne Gretzky Hockey </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">helped him land a job at the studio, he clearly has reason to be so passionate)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Minutes after he passed by, Sony San Diego product development communications brand strategist Ramone Russell took to the stage to accept the Sports Game of the Year award for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MLB The Show 24</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a repeat achievement at the awards for the branded baseball series.

"A lot of these sports games are the reasons why other games get greenlit," he explained. "If your sport game is good, and it's coming out every year, and you have these fans that are supporting it, it allows for us and other companies to greenlight other games that wouldn't have been made."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Sports games are a very important part of the video game ecosystem."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sports games can drive big wins—or big losses—for studios">Sports games can drive big wins—or big losses—for studios</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Russell's words land at a particularly apt moment, because mere weeks before he laid down these facts for us, his peers at EA were scrambling over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-warns-investors-of-slowdown-after-ea-sports-fc-and-dragon-age-underperform">a shortfall in revenue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>EA Sports FC 24.

The studio didn't just add players to the game's roster, it produced a bona fide campaign called "Storylines" packed with polished documentaries that laid out the story of the leagues, and why their success was more than just a compelling spectacle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We needed to be able to tell a story [with this game mode] because 95 percent of our audience has no idea what the heck the Negro Leagues are," Russell </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mlb-the-show-s-negro-leagues-inclusion-needed-to-tell-a-story-">explained to us</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That Sony San Diego was able to take such an ambitious gamble while pressing ahead on the next annual entry in the series remains a feat and makes this year's win all the more impressive.
