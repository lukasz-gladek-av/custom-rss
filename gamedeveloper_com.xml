Via a press release at the time, co-founder Oscar J-T Holm said that while the 10 Chambers hadn't conducted any closed or public playtests by that time, the co-op shooter had already accrued over half a million wishlists. Yet, the studio is yet to announce a release date.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTFO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was delayed multiple times," Hom said. "We don’t think it's fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
