After the trailer debuted, viewers—many of them game developers—began speculating that the game or the trailer are using generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As internet sleuths dug through the business profiles of SuperAuthenti and its executives, some began to wonder if the game might also use blockchain technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company (like a cat) played coy at first, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/catly-announcement-game-awards-2024/">first telling Digital Trends</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it would share more details on the game in 2025. That seems to have changed. Today, a SuperAuthenti PR spokesperson told Game Developer that there is no generative AI in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or its teaser. Additionally, they said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is "not a blockchain game," and there are no </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamestop-s-crypto-plans-collapse-as-retailer-prepares-to-shut-nft-marketplace">non-fungible tokens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (NFTs) or other blockchain currency affiliated with the product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We did not use generative AI to produce the video and the game," the spokesperson said. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculation. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that could produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SuperAuthenti shared a work-in-progress video of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trailer with Game Developer, which contained a number of before-and-after shots showing the pre-rendered kitties bouncing around their playroom. The cat's models did not appear to contain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models">telltale signs of generated 3D models</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (no unusual symmetry, no melded limbs, and no baked-in textures), and the environment also appeared to be created with traditional 3D animation. Some shots featured the cats rendered with full fur, others showed models implemented before fur animations were added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models" target="_self">How devs can spot AI-generated 3D models</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5954_rF8tU" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cat models did appear to have been fully mapped and rigged before these clips were captured, but it otherwise didn't seem that different from other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/H7pbEKZmYj0?list=PL2e4mYbwSTbbHAJT7OdK5mv-idhlLOTl0&amp;t=433">behind-the-scenes clips of CG animation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="SuperAuthenti says any there isn't any blockchain technology in ">SuperAuthenti says any there isn't any blockchain technology in <span>Catly</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As spotted by Digital Trends, Speculation over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s possible use of blockchain tech was based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/tenthplanet-unveils-two-ambitious-blockchain-games/">a possible connection</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to blockchain game developer TenthPlanet.
