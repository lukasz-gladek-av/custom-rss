Rather than following what the co-founders call traditional agreements, in which publishers prioritize recouping their investment before a developer sees a royalty check, the publisher wants to operate on a "developer-first" structure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our model is simple: we place the financial health of the studio above our own short-term ROI," co-founder Jacek Pudlik said in the announcement. "Most publishers act like banks that need to be repaid immediately. We act like partners who only succeed when the developer is already winning. If the developer doesn't survive, the industry doesn't survive."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-studio-ares-interactive-secures-70-million-investment" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mobile studio Ares Interactive secures $70 million investment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The final straw for us was seeing too many brilliant games get rejected or homogenized because they didn't fit a template," co-founder Nic van 't Schip said. "We built Pixel Doors to be the antidote to that 'pencil pusher' culture. We are opening doorways for the breakthroughs, not just the blockbusters."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label's first title is roguelite beat 'em up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mad King Redemption</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is being developed by Secret Mission and is slated to launch in early access in Q1 2026. According to Pixel Doors' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pixeldoors.com/about-us">official site</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the services include handling the go-to-market strategy, platform relations, and business operations, claiming to provide the "big publisher" infrastructure without the "corporate politics."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via email, when asked how Pixel Doors measures success—as in, how they decide when it's time for the revenue share to take place—Schip said it's the moment when "the game launched and the developer has made enough money from it to keep the lights on."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The most positive reading from the 2024 Steam Data reads that one in 24 games made [$]250,000 or more on Steam... and the majority of the other[s] didn't make 1,000 bucks," he continued. "So if a game launches and the developer makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>any</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> money from it that can sustain them to allow them to continue to work on their project, it is success for us as we've already helped that dev beat those dreadful odds. Us being paid, our revenue share, kicks in later."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pixel Doors will be attending GDC 2026 and is actively seeking to meet with independent developers "who are tired of traditional publishing politics" and have a "clear, unique vision for their game."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amd-boss-indicates-next-gen-xbox-could-land-in-2027" target="_self" data-discover="true">AMD boss indicates next-gen Xbox could land in 2027</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina. Video games helped him to learn English, so now he covers them for places like The New York Times, NPR, Rolling Stone, and more.
