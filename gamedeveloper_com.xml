In annual financial results posted today, the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest developer reported an 8 percent decrease in net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, diving from ¥356 billion (about $2.5 billion) billion to ¥324 billion (about $2.2 billion).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Operating income decreased accordingly, dropping from ¥40 billion to ¥32 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes—and a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-reviewing-production-pipeline-amid-spluttering-sales">steady stream</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of sagging </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-final-fantasy-xvi-and-final-fantasy-rebirth-did-not-meet-our-expectations-">quarterly financial results</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over the last year—prompted the company to announce a 3-year business plan promising a "reboot for long-term growth." Its strategy centers around reorganizing its development studios to operate under one management group, expanding revenue opportunities by "strengthening customer contact points," and other corporate initiatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This plan began taking shape in 2024 with the shuffling of its internal studios under one "franchise management division." This means all Square Enix developers working on online games, "HD games," and "SD games" are in one business unit. Its AI and engine development divisions, as well as its audio, QA, and other "development-related specialized organizations" now sit outside these studios. The company says this shuffling led to "discontinued development" of some games (including a Kingdom Hearts mobile spin-off), and increased investment in titles that "require refinement."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-considering-to-pass-on-trump-tariffs-to-hardware-prices-and-sees-us-manufacturing-possible" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony may 'pass on' Trump tariffs to customers, is considering US manufacturing on hardware</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This reorg has already led to decreased spending on advertising and promotion for its portfolio of free-to-play mobile games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Quest Tact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
