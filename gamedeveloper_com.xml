It appears someone with access to Activision's Slack channel is sending screenshots and photos of these messages directly to these users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Activision Senior QA tester Sam Hudson appeared to confirm the ongoing harassment in a post on LinkedIn on January 25 and stated several of their colleagues had been "doxxed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This employee took screenshots of ABK wide discussions about the safety of our protected information (like name changes and visa statuses) and sent them to an an extremely racist, sexist, and transphobic individual on Twitter who has over a 100 thousand followers," they added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is even more dangerous to be trans or an immigrant at Activision now apparently, as someone who works with us has no problems doxxing people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reviewed the leaked message and identified the names of several current employees of Activision and its subsidiaries.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mad-mushroom-cofounder-asmongold-to-step-away-from-company-after-islamophobic-remarks" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mad Mushroom cofounder Asmongold to 'step away' from company after anti-Muslim remarks</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These leaks raise questions about what Activision is doing to protect its employees, and what action it will take against the person or persons who shared the screenshots if they work for the company.

In follow-up posts, he singled out a technical artist at the company for posts they had liked on Facebook and called for veterans groups to cut ties with Activision over these policies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other far-right users on X and YouTube have circulated these screenshots, ridiculing the employees and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/C1O5fM1pSqg?si=ivRMgWwlub7u2922">encouraging others to join in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Online harassment campaigns continue to target developers in 2025">Online harassment campaigns continue to target developers in 2025</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers have endured a resurgent right-wing harassment campaign lashing out over the depiction of underrepresented characters in games since early 2024.
