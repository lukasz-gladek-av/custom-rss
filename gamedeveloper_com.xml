Discord pledged that its approach to age-assurance would ensure video selfies used for facial age estimation never leave a user's device, and that identity documents submitted to its vendor partners would be swiftly deleted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite those assurances, the recent data leak raised valid questions about Discord's ability to protect their confidential information. There are also simply widespread concerns about the prospect of handing over personal data to huge corporations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-radical-entertainment-hothead-games-devs-form-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ex-Radical Entertainment, Hothead Games devs form new studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord CTO and co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy has now admitted the company failed clearly explain its process and rationale to address those fears.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Let me be upfront: we knew this rollout was going to be controversial. Any time you introduce something that touches identity and verification, people are going to have strong feelings. Rightfully so. In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">he wrote in a lengthy blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we're requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That's not what's happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why. That's on us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After missing the mark, Discord is pushing back its global age verification rollout until the second half of 2026 and adding more verification options, including the ability to use a credit card.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-discord-confidentially-files-for-ipo">IPO-chasing company</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has also pledged to be fully transparent about the third-party vendors involved in the age verification process—and insisted it will not work with companies that do not ensure biometric facial data remains on a user's device.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Discord co-founder accepts criticism but insists 'teens need real safeguards'">Discord co-founder accepts criticism but insists 'teens need real safeguards'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vishnevskiy stated that over 90 percent of Discord users will never be asked to verify their age because they do not access age-restricted content.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/kingdom-come-deliverance-director-steps-away-from-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Kingdom Come: Deliverance director steps away from game development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also explained that many who do will be automatically processed by an internal system that uses information like account-level signals (how long an account has existed) and payment methods on file to estimate a user's age.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The idea is simple: we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult. And it works both ways: a vendor has no way to associate your identity back to your Discord account either. That's by design," added Vishnevskiy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know many of you are skeptical of how we handle partnerships, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">security incident last year involving our third-party customer service provider</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only adds to that skepticism. To be clear, we do not use that vendor for age assurance. In fact, we no longer work with them at all, and we've taken the lessons from that incident seriously.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every vendor we work with goes through a security and privacy review before integration. That includes contractual limits on data use, and strict retention and deletion requirements. Information submitted for age verification is stored only for the minimum time necessary, which in most cases means it's deleted immediately. If a vendor doesn’t pass, we don’t work with them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Vishnevskiy claimed that only around 10 percent of users will need to actively age verify, but stressed the ability to accurately determine a user's age remains paramount.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-shutting-down-ugc-dungeon-brawler-king-of-meat-after-six-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Amazon shutting down UGC dungeon brawler King of Meat after six months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you. We also know these changes carry different weight for different communities, and that for some, questions of privacy and identity aren't just preferences but safety concerns shaped by real experience. That's not lost on us, and it directly informs the choices we're making," continued Vishnevskiy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We also know, from running this platform for more than 10 years, that teens need real safeguards. The number of teenagers on Discord has significantly increased since the pandemic, and they deserve an experience appropriate to their age. At the same time, we believe adults should be able to have a full content experience on Discord. Doing both responsibly means having safeguards that help ensure age-restricted content stays in adult spaces."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
