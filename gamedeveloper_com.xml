Google will charge a 20 percent fee on in-app purchases that provide "more than a de minimis gameplay advantage, and a 9 percent fee for other purchases like in-app subscriptions and purchasing premium games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Google can still charge another fee for transactions that take place through Play Billing, though developers will now be able to include alternative payment options that can be shown side-by-side with Google's in-game purchasing platform. They would be free to set different prices for transactions on alternative platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a compromise on Epic's part.
