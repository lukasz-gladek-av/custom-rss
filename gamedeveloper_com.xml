Crucially, however, the discount history page will split out data to align with timeframes covering past discounts.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the developer or publisher of a game, pricing and discounting is in your hands, so you may find this information useful when considering your future discounting opportunities," explained Valve.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Steam developers can access the discount history for a specific package (which is the purchase option used to buy a product) by hitting the "%" button on an application's landing page. From there, they'll be shown a table containing all of the past discounts implemented on that package.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted by Valve, that table now includes four new columns:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"#" — This column shows the number of times that you've run a discount with the same % discount for the given USD base price&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Revenue" — The total revenue for the timeframe of the discount.
