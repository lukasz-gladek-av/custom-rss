These downloads were, by far, the largest downloads for each of the three Key Employees at any time since at least 2022."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unknown Worlds said those downloads included confidential information of "nearly every type" including business records, intellectual property, internal communications, Subnautica concepts, game design files and other items that were redacted in the public version of the lawsuit.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The scope of the projected release was degraded time and time again&quot;">"The scope of the projected release was degraded time and time again"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unknown Worlds also restated claims that at least two of the aforementioned leaders "checked out" in all but name.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-shuts-down-questions-about-layoffs-and-israel-ties-at-gamescom-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Microsoft shuts down questions about layoffs and Israel ties at Gamescom 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Cleveland was the first to stray," reads the lawsuit. "Despite publicly holding himself out as the Chief Executive Officer and Game Director of Unknown Worlds, he was gradually becoming disengaged. In 2022, the lead developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a franchise and project supposed to be led by Cleveland—openly complained that the project had no creative leadership, and 'I haven't been able to get much of Charlie's time lately and sort of don't know what he really thinks or wants to hear.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By 2023, Cleveland announced to friends and some colleagues that he was leaving videogame development to learn how to produce movies and explore other interests. He later changed his LinkedIn profile to “part-time” and, by 2024, he abandoned all creative or other leadership roles with the Company."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unknown Worlds then alleges that McGuire became buried in his passion project, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Moonbreaker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, even after the turn-based strategy title (also developed by Unknown Worlds and published by Krafton) had been deemed a "commercial failure."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Eventually he, too, abandoned any pretense of technical involvement in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

"Worse, the scope of the projected release was degraded time and time again. What originally was projected to be a limited scope, 'early access' release, was limited to little more than a sandbox."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, Unknown Worlds claims all three former leaders pushed for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to be released before it was ready in pursuit of that seismic earnout. It alleges their termination was a result of that transgression, and ultimately sparked the legal battle we find ourselves watching at this very moment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unknown Worlds has requested the court prevent Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill from disclosing its trade secrets, confidential, and proprietary business information or using that information to benefit themselves or a third party.
