It's an exciting launch for us. We're still in the early stages of this rollout. Roughly a third of our members&nbsp; have access to TV-based games as a process of upgrading the TV technology and TV clients to be able to handle that," said Peters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And recently, with our party games on TV—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Boggle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pictionary</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LEGO Party!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—we've seen really strong uptake. So, it's off a small base—I think about 10 percent reach into those eligible members—but our TV-based games have enjoyed quite a significant engagement uptick after that Party Pack launch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Peters said Netflix Games will be expanding its "cloud-first strategy" over the next year with the addition of new titles such as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix">recently-announced soccer simulator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Delphi Interactive and FIFA.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-goty-at-the-new-york-game-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wins GOTY at the New York Game Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That title will debut exclusively on Netflix Games in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026, and according to Peters will be "more accessible" than its competitors.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're going to ramp our investment based on demonstrated value to members and returns to the business&quot;">"We're going to ramp our investment based on demonstrated value to members and returns to the business"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Netflix Games has struggled to carve out a clear identity since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-is-launching-on-november-3">launching in 2021</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The division roared into life with a huge investment and M&amp;A spree that saw Netflix establish an internal triple-A studio and acquire notable developers such as Boss Fight Entertainment, Night School Studio, and Spry Fox.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, around five later, the company has either </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-closes-its-only-aaa-game-studio">completely shut down</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-netflix-to-sell-spry-fox-back-to-founders">divested from</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">downsized</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the majority of those teams in an effort to refocus and adopt a "less is more strategy" to expanding its video game business (although it could soon </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">become the owner of Warner Bros. Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery proves successful).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that reset, Netflix has focused on expanding its slate of games with social party titles, recognizable properties from third-party studios (such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and more casual titles based on its own IP.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/should-triple-a-sequels-have-smaller-budgets-than-their-predecessors-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Should triple-A sequels have smaller budgets than their predecessors?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hope is that Netflix subscribers—all of whom have access to Netflix Games—will either choose to play those titles on mobile devices,&nbsp;web browser, or on compatible televisions (while using their smartphone as controller, in some instances).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Netflix boasted over 325 million paid members during the fourth-quarter of the last fiscal year, it's not hard to see why the company is keen to make video games as accessible as possible. According to Peters, however, there is still some way to go on that journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are just scratching the surface today in terms of what we can do in this space, but we are already seeing multiple instances of how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the service and with the story, but it also creates synergies that reinforces both mediums. So the interactive and non-interactive side. That drives more engagement and more retention," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Bottom line: we're very bullish on the opportunity side. We're seeing progress, but we still have a lot of work to go do. And I should say, like all of our developing initiatives, we're going to ramp our investment based on demonstrated value to members and returns to the business."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
