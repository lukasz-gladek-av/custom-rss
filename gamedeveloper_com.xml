We found that&nbsp;more studios adopt Generative AI, even though it’s increasingly unpopular among developers. Layoffs have continued, to the point where one in 10 developers have lost their jobs over the past year.

Developers pointed to intellectual property theft, energy consumption, a decrease in quality from AI-generated content, potential biases within AI programs and regulation issues as the main factors behind their discontent with the technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More than half of developers surveyed (52%) work for companies that have implemented generative AI and one-third (36%) personally use them. Respondents within Business and Finance Roles in companies were most likely to use Artificial intelligence tools (51%), followed by Production and Team Leadership (41%) and Community, Marketing and PR (39%).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PC Game Development Skyrockets">PC Game Development Skyrockets</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, 66% of developers reported that they were working on games for PC; this year, that number climbed up to 80%. While the reason for this is unclear, it could be at least partially attributed to the rising popularity for Valve’s Steam Deck. While the Steam Deck wasn’t specifically listed as an option for developers to list as a platform they’re developing games for, of the respondents who chose the ‘Other’ option, 44% of them wrote in Steam Deck as a platform they’re interested in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, web browser games are also climbing in popularity, as 16% of developers noted that they’re working on releases for web browsers (compared to 10% last year and 11% the year before).

That’s nearly double the next most option of project-based or publishing deals, which 28% noted was where their funding had come from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those who reported that they had utilized self-funding appear to be a good option, as 89% of respondents listed it as being at least somewhat successful for them. Co-development contracts have observed the highest rate of satisfaction, with one-third (37%) calling the method “very successful.” Accelerators were seen as the least viable option, with 43% calling the option “not successful at all.” This was followed by Venture Capital at 32% and crowdfunding at 31%.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Climate Change Impacts A Notable Number of Developers">Climate Change Impacts A Notable Number of Developers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, the impacts of climate change continued to be felt across the game industry, with 16% of developers saying they or their company have been impacted by natural disasters. 76% said they haven’t been impacted whereas 8% opted for the didn’t know option.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked to specify what natural disasters they or their company faced, 73% of respondents referenced floods, hurricanes, storms and other water-related events.
