In its own statement, the VGHF said it was "disappointed" by the Office's decision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preserving games has been a longstanding issue in the industry both in and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-australian-game-industry-significant-loss-preservation">outside of the US</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the VGHF has previously </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-video-game-history-foundation-is-fundraising-in-the-name-of-preservation">made moves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-video-game-history-foundation-is-working-to-save-our-source-code">preserve</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, celebrate, and teach the history of video games." Last year, the Foundation released a study saying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/study-finds-nearly-every-pre-2010-video-game-is-unavailable">87 percent of games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> released prior to 2010 in the country were virtually inaccessible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In page 191 of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">Registers' Recommendation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Office cited comments from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) which claimed preservation supporters like the VGHF "[did] not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game." Likewise, it suggested those lack of requirements meant supporters aimed to "reserve almost complete discretion in how they would provide access to preserve[d] games."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ESA and game preservation">The ESA and game preservation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ESA has repeatedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-org-won-t-cooperate-game-preservation">pushed back</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> against game preservation efforts, and continued to do so here. In its argument, the organization said a "substantial market" still exists for classic games, including secondary markets. "Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market," it wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comments like those echo the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-expects-companies-to-fix-preservation-problem">organization's stance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in 2023: preservation is an issue to be handled by the publishers and their affiliates, not historians or archivists of any kind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, the Register sided with the ESA, saying the VGHF "have not met their burden of showing that reproducing works to allow for multiple simultaneous use in the computer program class is likely to be fair." Additional criticism was levied at the VGHF's emulation stance, which was deemed "inconsistent and incomplete and the technologies are not addressed in the exemption text."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response to the Office's stance, the VGHF said it was "not done fighting here. We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We encourage people in the game industry who are disappointed by the Copyright Officeâ€™s decision to ask their leadership to push for greater support for the work of libraries and archives within their industry groups," it concluded.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire. In addition to Game Developer, his writing can be found at io9 over on Gizmodo. Don't ask him about how much gum he's had, because the answer will be more than he's willing to admit.</span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
