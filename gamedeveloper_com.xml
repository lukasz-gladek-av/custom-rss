It's a compelling if somewhat morbid approach—and one that might require frequent updates in order to accurately reflect the current state of the world.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ziff Davis lays off IGN staff after months-long acquisition spree"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-lays-off-staff-affecting-12-percent-of-the-union-s-bargaining-unit">Ziff Davis lays off IGN staff after months-long acquisition spree</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">IGN parent company Ziff Davis just posted its "strongest quarterly revenue growth since 2021," with gaming and entertainment revenue increasing by 7.5 percent year-over-year. Huzzah! Bonuses and champagne for everyone! In another reality, maybe. In this timeline, the conglomate instead chose to make eight members of the IGN team redundant, including some members of the IGN Union. 23 people were laid off across the board. Oh, those cuts also come after a massive acquisition drive. Go figure.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastercard Denies Pressuring Steam To Censor ‘NSFW’ Games (but Valve pushes back)"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Mastercard Denies Pressuring Steam To Censor ‘NSFW’ Games (but Valve pushes back)</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Kotaku //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Payment provider Mastercard has been catching flack for seemingly forcing Valve and Itch to curb the sale of adult and NSFW content on their platforms. The company was accused of pressuring both to adapt their policies at the behest of a anti-porn movement called Collective Shout. Confusion and anger understandably ensued. Mastercard eventually commented on the matter and said it hasn't imposted restrictions "of any activity on game creator sites and platforms" and all was forgiven. Wait, scratch that last part. Valve quickly cast doubt on those claims in a statement to Kotaku and explained that while Mastercard did not communicate with it directly, the company did express concerns "through payment processor and banking intermediaries." Feud reignited.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'We fought hard:' Raven QA union secures contract after three years of bargaining"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-fought-hard-raven-qa-union-secures-contract-after-three-years-of-bargaining">'We fought hard:' Raven QA union secures contract after three years of bargaining</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Amid mass layoffs at Microsoft, a handful of QA workers within the company's Raven Software subsidiary scored a massive victory this week after securing their first union contract. 19 members of the Game Workers Alliance-CWA ratified a contract after three years of bargaining, securing wage increases, crunch and layoff protections, expanded disability accommodations, and more. "Going from organizing to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there,” said Autumn Prazuch, QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path." Hear hear. &nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
