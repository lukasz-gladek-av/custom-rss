"AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Verdu suggested figuring out how to harness generative AI technology is the next big challenge facing the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I can't believe how lucky I am to be alive when a wave this big is about to hit the game industry. Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights. Yes, we'll have to adapt and change, but when have we failed to meet that challenge as an industry?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Major game companies continue to board the generative AI bandwagon">Major game companies continue to board the generative AI bandwagon</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Verdu isn't the first executive to whisper sweet nothings into the primordial ear of generative AI.
