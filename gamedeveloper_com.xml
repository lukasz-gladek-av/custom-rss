It also, however, believes Tencent only made that approach after starting work on Light of Motiram and continued to "secretly" develop the title even after failing to secure the Horizon license.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SIE's lawsuit includes multiple screenshots of the pitch deck (shown below) presented by Tencent during that 2024 meeting. The Japanese company says Tencent suggested the title would have "potential for Gaas adaption" and would look to incorporate gameplay elements such as survival, crafting, pet taming, and multiplayer game modes.</span></p><p>Image via Sony</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The pitch deck included mock-ups of Eastern-inspired designs and settings, including one of Aloy—Horizon's lead female character—standing on the Great Wall of China," continues the suit.

Tencent announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Light of Motiram</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> later that year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, SIE claims Tencent has violated the Copyright Act and is causing irreparable harm to its business.

It is also seeking damages, including up to $150,000 for each "separate work in the Horizon franchise infringed, and for Tencent to be ordered to deliver all infringing materials to SIE's attorneys for destruction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/894233039/Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-v-Tencent-Holdings-Ltd-Et-Al-3-25-Cv-06275-No-1-N-D-cal-Jul-25-2025">You can read the full lawsuit on Scribd (via Game File)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
