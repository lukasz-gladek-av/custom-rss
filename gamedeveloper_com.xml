His lack of games experience showed as studios reportedly spent months seeking his approval on various matters, from their next game project to whether or not they would appear at a trade event like E3.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Staff at WB Games Montreal and Monolith Productions expanded on those thoughts, telling Bloomberg they felt "stuck in limbo" while waiting for Haddad and his team to provide answers.
