Microsoft has clearly scrutinized each part of the ZeniMax portfolio after a major launch, and now one week out from the debut of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's starting to feel like the studio's fate rests on the shoulder of one new gameplay feature: the parry mechanic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is hardly the first game to demand players carefully time their blocks to stun or counter their enemies, but it may be one of the first big-budget first-person shooters with that game mechanic. Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom Eternal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the market has been flooded by a number of Doom-inspired games earning praise and drawing dollars for a fraction of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' budget.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-s-time-for-gaming-awards-to-rethink-the-strategy-sim-category" target="_self" data-discover="true">It's time for gaming awards to rethink the strategy/sim category</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A decade ago, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would roll over the competition. Today it's worth asking—is the crowd interested in games inspired by the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the same playerbase that's grown to love parrying in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the recently-released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Will they find this to be the right new direction for Doom or will this sole divergence make it easier to shrug off the rage of the Slayer?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Doom: The Dark Ages"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span> is designed around the parry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When players boot up their Xbox (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">whatever form it takes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) with a craving for first-person demon slaying, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be just a click away from the faster-paced, parry-free forefathers. And players will quickly find in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the entire game is rebuilt around that one button.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The changes are quite complex—the rank-and-file developers at id have put a lot of work into answering the question "what if Doom Guy had a shield?" and the answers don't just all come down to the timing of a simple button click. Gone is the "dash" seen in the last two Doom games, replaced by a shield charge that closes the gap between the player and monstrous foes. Parryable attacks are telegraphed with a glowing green visual effect, and most of them take the form of slower-moving projectiles inspired by the "bullet hell" genre—and of course the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/doom-the-dark-ages-development-details-shine-light-on-the-state-of-modern-triple-a-production">conversations with the press</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, game director Hugo Martin and executive producer Marty Stratton referenced a desire to revive gameplay where players weave around slow-moving shots moving in geometric patterns, a trend that vanished in the shift to ever-more "realistic" shooters).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-stakes-its-claim-to-pc-gaming-handhelds-with-steamos-s-arrival-on-lenovo-legion-go-s" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve stakes its claim to PC gaming handhelds with SteamOS’s arrival on Lenovo Legion Go S</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That design decision is where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stands out from its FromSoftware-inspired peers, but the gravity of that dynamic stretches into the architecture itself—Environments are more tailored for circle-strafing around enemy creatures than racing forward to stay one step ahead of the bullet that might kill you.</span></p><p>Image via id Software/Bethesda.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The digital architecture is also shaped by this feature. Microsoft's admirable commitment to accessibility is present here in the form of deeply-configurable difficulty controls that let players adjust the parrying window to one that fits their ability. It also lets them modify everything from enemy aggression to bullet speed, to general gameplay speed, and beyond. These settings that can stretch the game so far it raises the idea that two players might go through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and have two very different experiences.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-last-humble-bee-postmortem-staying-sane-in-solo-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Last Humble Bee postmortem: Staying sane in solo development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the biggest gamble: the decision to prioritize parrying over online multiplayer. Mechanics that monitor precise timing are a perilous thing in online environments. It's not impossible—FromSoftware has made its name on allowing players to visit each other's games, either to help or hinder them in their quest for power. But the foundation of the Doom multiplayer doesn't favor collaborative monster-slaying or careful one-on-one duels. Ejecting the multiplayer element allowed id Software to build out unique control schemes where the player switches to piloting a giant robots and heavy metal dragons, but those setpieces are supporting acts for the main game loop—made possible by eliminating online networking, but not the point of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And forgoing online multiplayer is where we return to the business of investing four years of multimillion dollar development in a parry-heavy game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Without the feature that usually drives ROI on titanic games like this—will this direction prove to be the right one for the next Doom game?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Doom: The Dark Ages"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span>'s surprising competition: "boomer shooters"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the id Software team heroically toiled away for four years making the next great Doom game, a sea of other titles inspired by the original 1993 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have flooded consoles and PCs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These games—sometimes called "Boomer Shooters" include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">Selaco</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/">Warhammer 40k: Boltgun</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/DUSK/">Dusk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and beyond. Plenty others have been flops, but the growing reception to them signals audiences have plenty of options to take in the gunplay of Doom games, but are drawn in by low-budget gameplay twists and unique settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If one of these "boomer shooters" hit the market with a parry system built from the ground up, it would be less noteworthy—another swing at innovation from a small team. But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' parry system is an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>expensive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> parry system, recalibrating years of code, animation, and design to match a popular emerging trend. The R&amp;D into this tech came with improvements to the quality of 3D models (and an amazing reduction in load times), but those advancements don't have the same time to shine.</span></p><p>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">id's other unique hook here is the promise of a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prequel, telling the tale of the Slayer's time in captivity before the 2016 game. Given that boomer shooters have also played around with setting and minimalist narrative, there may have been room to search for a unique hook here too. If </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom: The Dark Ages</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> used the new setting to springboard a more ambitious story—one that gave its silent protagonist more to do than glower at his captors—that hook could drive word-of-mouth enthusiasm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The medieval sci-fi/fantasy aesthetic is fresh, but still not that different than the straight sci-fi/satanic art direction of the last two games. The cinematics are traditional, not even packing the dark humor of the 2016 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where the player character had comical disregard for all the powers that be issuing directives in his ear. That isn't necessarily a knock on the story's quality or direction, but the familiar tone and framing seem in service of keeping players focused on a new kind of combat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's amusing. Just like the Doom Slayer, id Software is now trying to precisely time a big action in order to land a major blow.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
