The answer is—complicated. But everyone agrees that large companies being too brittle to survive a multimillion dollar game underperforming play a huge role in our current plight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Everyone’s fishing for ways to solve that. Some people say AI will speed up game development and bring budgets down. Some people are building studios for UGC platforms. And some people, like Midwest Games CEO Ben Kvalo, want developers to completely rethink the financial structure of how games are made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today on the Game Developer Podcast, we’re quizzing Kvalo about his vision for the game industry’s future, why elevating developers from underrepresented regions plays a part in that role, and how his love for the midwest United States plays a part in this big project.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Games can learn from Hollywood (just not in the way you think)">Games can learn from Hollywood (just not in the way you think)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you want to understand Kvalo’s vision a little better, look at the number of production companies and financial entities behind most major motion pictures.

Right now one studio or publisher bears most of the financial risk for a game, at best pulling in outside contractors to manage some of the overhead cost of development.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fall-guys-veterans-establish-new-studio-panic-stations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Fall Guys veterans establish new studio Panic Stations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if game developers could do a better job than Hollywood at bringing financial entities together to sustainably fund and make games?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About the Game Developer Podcast">About the Game Developer Podcast</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Developer podcast is a bi-weekly podcast chronicling the triumphs, catastrophes, and everything in-between of game development, sharing lessons and strategies fellow developers can use to hone their craft.
