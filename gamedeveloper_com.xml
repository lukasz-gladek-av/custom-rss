All were part of a private trade union Discord channel and members of the IWGB.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IWGB organizers explained some of those impacted had been relying on essential workplace healthcare schemes and visas sponsored by Rockstar, which is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">said IWGB president, Alex Marshall, in a statement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marshall said IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure its members are reinstated and receive interim relief.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/midwest-games-ceo-ben-kvalo-s-vision-for-a-more-sustainable-game-industry-game-developer-podcast-ep-58" target="_self" data-discover="true">Midwest Games CEO Ben Kvalo's vision for a more sustainable game industry - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 58</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?embedded-checkout=true">In a statement handed to Bloomberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Take-Two Interactive head of global communications Alan Lewis said the firings were "for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer earlier today, an IWGB spokesperson said there was no evidence those fired were guilty of "gross misconduct." Notably, they said employees were not made aware of that purported reasoning at the time of their dismissal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IWGB is still in the process of exploring what sort of legal action can be taken. Game Developer understands the union currently represents around 10 percent of Rockstar UK.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news comes just months before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is scheduled to launch in May 2026. Analysts believe the open-world title could generate $10 billion in lifetime revenue (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">via The Telegraph</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Its predecessor, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, remains hugely lucrative for Take-Two despite launching over a decade ago and has sold over 215 million copies worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IWGB Game Workers Union chair, Spring Mcparlin-Jones, said Rockstar's "attack" on the rights of those responsible for crafting one of its most valuable franchises makes it clear that "money matters more than people."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reached out to Take-Two for comment and was provided with the following statement by spokesperson Alan Lewis:&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fall-guys-veterans-establish-new-studio-panic-stations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Fall Guys veterans establish new studio Panic Stations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities.
