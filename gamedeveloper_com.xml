It's also worth noting that Peak is currently available for an introductory price of $5—a 38 percent discount on its $7.99 retail price. It's an offer you'd imagine has convinced groups of friends to nab the title in the hopes of summiting its titular peak.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
