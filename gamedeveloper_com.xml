I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To Lee, the strategy is "human creativity."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nexon has been working on AI tools for eight years">Nexon has been working on AI tools for eight years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the CEO was talking about future Nexon projects, it's unclear how or in which capacity AI will be implemented during the game development process. In 2017, the company launched Intelligence Labs, an in-house AI research and development team, which can help paint a picture.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstart-hit-with-legal-claims-by-iwgb-over-firing-of-unionizing-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3296675">The Korea Herald</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Intelligence Labs has used machine learning and deep learning to "come up with more engaging and immersive games," spearheaded by a team of around 700 engineers that is now "zeroing in on generative artificial intelligence research to create original, personalized content for players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more practical example, the team publicly launched Gamescale in April 2023, which offers a game matchmaking algorithm based on user preferences and playstyles, posing an alternative to skill-based matchmaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other tools include the Nexon Voice Creator, a text-to-speech system that creates voices in different accents and pitches for nonplayer characters without separate recordings. The team has also been testing the "AI NPC" function, allowing NPCs to "directly communicate with users beyond a single script." As noted by The Korea Herald, this opens the possibility of creating "false, biased, discriminatory, and abusive remarks." To this, Intelligence Labs said it's committed to "putting effort into building ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI in gaming."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lee's comments on the use of AI at the company took place amid a wave of criticism around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arc Raiders</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the extraction shooter developed by Embark Studios and published by Nexon. Over at the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the studio has an AI-generated content disclosure, which states the following: "During the development process, we may use procedural-and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/california-court-postpones-approval-of-proposed-settlement-between-epic-games-and-google" target="_self" data-discover="true">Federal Judge casts doubt on Epic v.

That is, we hire and contract voice actors for it—it's part of their contract that we use it [AI] for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like our ping system, where it's capable of saying every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions. That's how we can get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game," Watkins told PCGamesN.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-unveils-japanese-language-only-playstation-5-at-350" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony unveils Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 at $350</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders">Eurogamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Embark CCO Stefan Strandberg said the studio uses "AI as tools to assist in some content creation, but it's always in the context of creativity, as an expression of the team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on the text-to-speech model specifically, Strandberg said that the tool allows the team to "increase the scope of the game in some areas" where Embark thinks it's needed, or where there's "tedious repetition" in situations where voice actors "may not see it as valuable work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CCO's justification, then, is that these tools are allowing smaller teams to scale their operations. "We started this studio with a massive set of procedural tools when it comes to world building, and we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are today without those investments," he said."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
