The now-deleted post on the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1825110/discussions/0/4760955164872606515/">forums</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> claimed the studio "used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene "doubled back" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were "kicked off" the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Per </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/IanMitchell0/status/1898871515543748729">Mitchell</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple "voice filter," and they "make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us," he continued. He also revealed one voice actor had agreed to Serene's terms just hours before they and everyone else were let go, and Serene "told us they're switching to their original plan."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Castle of Secrets' </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1825110/Castle_of_Secrets/">Steam page</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> acknowledges the game has "sometimes generated voice acting." According to Nerida, that acknowledgement was on the page prior to actors being booked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a followup </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ItsNotMika/status/1898391303131390256">post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nerida said Serene Questworks "doesn't have any content of mine that would allow them to steal, take, or sample me." She also made her feelings on the technology clear: "Fuck AI. Shit's stupid. Create authentically."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has also reached out to Serene Gameworks and publisher Wandering Wizard for comment, and will update when a response is given.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
