From there, a designer would "augment or refine the prompt based on the model output...to iteratively design the game, or its initial version."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In November 2023, Microsoft struck a deal with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-to-bring-generative-ai-design-tools-to-xbox-devs">AI developer Inworld</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create a multi-platform AI toolset and character runtime engine. As it pertains to its various first-party teams, the latter was pitched with the possibility of generating stories, quests, and dialogue, which are key features to narrative-focused studios and their projects.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microsoft hopes you L3+R3 to accept genAI">Microsoft hopes you L3+R3 to accept genAI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025006277">patent's</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> description also notes how genAI could allow players to become a game's "co-creators...as a result of their exploration of and interaction with the game." It posits that genAI could use player tracking as a form of "implicit feedback for the next iteration of the game." As such, players could diverge from the developers' curated game experience and "explore new possibilities" which are then incorporated into subsequent iterations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar language about genAI's impact on games, and players in particular, has been used by executives at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/netflix-games-exec-prepares-bowl-of-word-salad-to-announce-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">Netflix Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/ea-ceo-60-percent-of-dev-processes-could-be-impacted-by-generative-ai-">EA</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
