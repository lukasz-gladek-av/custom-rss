It will also be dependent on internal resources and other projects that are in development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to the more experimental projects Relic intends to develop, Dowdeswell said the hope is to bring them to market in under two years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're looking to operate with smaller teams on shorter timeframes, which means likely getting a game in market roughly in the 1-2 year range," he continued. "Budget costs will vary depending on scope, but these titles will have a notably smaller budget than the big Relic RTS games we will continue to work on."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
