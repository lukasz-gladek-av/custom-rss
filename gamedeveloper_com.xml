            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-pokemon-go-ai-model<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Niantic recently announced a Large Geospatial Model (LGM), which uses machine learning to "understand a scene and connect it to millions of other scenes globally." But according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/">404 Media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the LGM was possibly made by conscripting unaware players into doing the studio's work for years through games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Go</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel?hl=en">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Niantic expressed hope the LGM would "implement a shared understanding of geographic locations, and comprehending places yet to be fully scanned." It's built on the studio's Visual Positioning System (VPS), which lets players "position themselves in the world with centimeter-level accuracy" and see or place digital content in their exact location, even after they've left.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Go </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ingress </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are augmented reality (AR) titles, and collect geolocated images as players explore locations to find Pokémon or player-made art. By Niantic's admission, its VPS has over 10 million locations scanned globally from the past five years, and "receive[s] about 1 million fresh scans each week," which are collected from its games—one of which has been quite popular for nearly a decade, meaning players may have unknowingly participated in helping build its LGM.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to a Large Language Model (LLM), Niantic's model scrapes data from real-world locations, and it hopes to use the technology to "enable computers not only to perceive and understand physical spaces, but also to interact with them in new ways." And what makes its data more substantial than something like Google Maps or Street is the point of view: as Niantic notes, the data is "taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of July 15, 2024, Niantic's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy">privacy policy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirms it uses geospatial technology and player recordings to "build a 3D understanding of real-world places, with the goal of offering new types of AR experiences to our users." The feature is opt-in and can be disabled by players at any time, but appears to be a "critical component" of Niantic's goals for AR and its model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The path from LLMs to LGMs is another step in AI’s evolution," its blog concluded. "The world’s future operating system will depend on the blending of physical and digital realities to create a system for spatial computing that will put people at the center."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The games industry wants to go in on genAI, for better or worse">The games industry wants to go in on genAI, for better or worse</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI have previously come under criticism for using what or whoever they could to build their AI technology.
