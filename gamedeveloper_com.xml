But EA didn't greenlight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> just to sell millions of $70 games on Steam. It's counting on post-launch in-app spending from millions of players to drive years of revenue. Developers across the globe know players will only open their wallets if they're enjoying their time online, and soon after launch, producer Alexia Christofi faced a significant challenge: players weren't having fun with the "meta progression" system meant to reward their time with the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It needed a little bit of a rework" she said in a conversation with Game Developer during the 2026 DICE conference. That admission echoed what we saw players posting on community platforms like Reddit in the months after launch: they were enjoying the game, but felt worn out and frustrated by having to unlock certain items through repetitive or unwanted tasks.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/clair-obscur-keeps-riding-high-at-2026-dice-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 rides high at 2026 DICE Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a high-pressure situation many developers are familiar with. Player feedback can come fast and furious, and fixes for their pain points take time. Christofi seemed unfazed as she recalled those early post-launch moments. "Players didn't like feeling they were forced into specific modes," she recalled, noting one particular problem. "We took a step back, re-evaluated, and as we're launching future seasons, we've changed our ethos a little bit to challenges and player progression in general."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That new ethos also applies to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Battle Pass—a key revenue driver for EA and mile marker for player progression.

For now. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched its "Season 2" content pack earlier this month, and players have had time to respond to the work from Christofi and her colleagues. She's the first to admit her job involves testing new ideas in limited groups that are likely to be received differently when encountered by millions of players. But with the triage scenario out of the way, they have a chance to build the future of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s live service vision.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ">The <span>Battlefield 6</span> progression team is spread across four game studios</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Battlefield Studios made a fascinating decision when building its live service management team. Christofi is technically employed by DICE Studios in Sweden (the game studio, not the conference, just to be clear), but works at the Criterion Games office in the UK. Her team consists of developers from all ends of the company, including Motive in Canada and Ripple Effect in the US.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/blizzard-agrees-to-redesign-overwatch-hero-s-appearance-after-backlash" target="_self" data-discover="true">Blizzard agrees to redesign Overwatch hero's appearance after backlash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s meta progression system is effectively under near-continuous development. "There have been times when I've woken up in my morning, we've seen something, we've got some bugs we need to fix for the next patch, and we haven't got around to fixing it by the evening... and then we've been able to hand it over to someone in LA to take that on and carry on working on that," she said.</span></p><p>Photo via Alexia Christofi</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Near-24/7 development doesn't solve all conventional live service update problems. Her team does have to grapple with the challenge of being able to recognize problems faster than they can fix them, leaving an uncomfortable gap between when players report issues and when they can even announce a fix, let alone roll it out. "Some things take a little bit more time," she admitted. "Some things we kind of see instantly and want to change quite quickly, so we have a vigorous hot-fix patching process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had stuff that we wanted to do for launch that maybe we didn't have time for, but then we also see that feedback and we want to change existing things. Trying to get that healthy balance between the two is tough, but worthwhile."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-prickly-protagonist-serves-a-powerful-purpose-narrative-notebook-1" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cairn's prickly protagonist serves a powerful purpose - Narrative Notebook #1</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's worth comparing this structure to that of Activision's Call of Duty series and EA's other major live service first-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
