This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp;for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turns your personal living area into a spacecraft, filling it with strange machinery and alien plant forms. Whether you want to get to know your plants and their varied personalities or fly to entire worlds from your living room, this VR game offers striking places to visit and some interesting plants to care for.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Doug North Cook, creative director of the Nuovo Award nominated game, to learn more about how they came upon the idea to make use of the player’s living space within a mixed-reality world, the design decisions that went into carefully making use of the player’s living space, and what appealed to them about having players care for plants when they’re soaring through the cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am Doug North Cook, the CEO and creative director of Creature, the studio behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I can’t emphasize enough how much of a group effort this project was with our art director Ashley Pinnick and engineering director Mark Schram co-leading development with a much larger team. Their leadership, passion, creativity, and brilliance are what helped our team ship something that, at the start, felt impossible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of my background is actually in academia. I was a design professor focused on immersive technology leading a department at Chatham University in Pittsburgh until my friend Callum Underwood convinced me to leave to run VR at Robot Teddy (where we helped release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Clockwinder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No More Rainbows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and several others). I left Robot Teddy to focus on building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and to build an XR-focused game label which also released the Meta Quest Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Maestro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Apple Vision Pro Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THRASHER</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original concept for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one of those magical moments where an idea lands nearly fully formed in your mind. I spent an entire day furiously filling a notebook to capture what I saw. The core concept revolved around this idea that if we were making a game in mixed reality and we couldn’t control the context that the user played the game in, then we needed to embrace the context and make it a core part of the game. We turned whatever room you played in into a starship and then we launched that room into outer space. Your room comes with you on an adventure, and in that way, it is a character in the story and the game feels different depending on where you play it. There is some deep magic in that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few days after having the original idea my wife helped me translate that initial vision into a pitch deck that I quickly shared around with the people who became the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team—the idea being to pull together people who had made some of the most important contributions to novel interaction, narrative, and technical design for immersive projects to date and get them all to collaborate on one project.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We built the game in Unity exclusively for the Meta Quest 3 series. This allowed us to do some techno-magic—integrating platform specific features to build a type of experience that is only just now possible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns your home into a spacefaring craft. What appealed to you about taking the player's living space and adding fantastic elements to it? Why mix their reality with your creative alien technology and beings?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We often talked during development about the idea of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an “assisted daydream” and that by grounding the player in their environment and slowing building up a shared illusion we can tap into the player’s imagination to fill in the gaps. We go really deep on the interactivity and responsiveness of the objects we put into your space so that you feel like they belong alongside the physical products in your space. We often see users move a chair to position themselves as the captain of the ship, move books from a shelf to make space for one of our plants—it is a type of imaginative play that demands a childlike approach. We wanted to instill in users a sense of wonder, delight, and awe.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating elements that would connect with the player's real world living space? What thoughts went into designing the various ship parts, technologies, and plants in such a way that they could connect with the player's world when living spaces are so varied in shape and structure?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was one of our biggest hurdles—making a contextless game that feels meaningful in any environment. Early on, we built consensus in the team around a few core design concepts that Ashley Pinnick, our art director, solidified into concept drawings and design language that dictated much of what the game became.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These included surface awareness—the idea that every object should meaningfully interact with the floor, tables, shelves, and any surface we can define at the platform level. A great example is the plant pots. If a user moves a pot towards a surface, the pot has legs that reach out from the bottom of the pot that land the pot on the surface and we cast a shadow on that surface—but if the player lets the pot go in mid-air the pot will turn on small jets that hover it in place. We try to ensure that players can interact with objects in a variety of ways and that they can discover through the natural course of play—learning alien technology as they go.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, we had ideas to augment the player’s space in more ways and have more visual overlays, but in the end what we found to be the most compelling with the current state of the technology was to have fewer objects that have a higher level of detail and richness. The plants are also aware of the space, the player, and each other in ways that can be surprising—one of the plants has a long tentacle arm that, if in reach of the helm, it will occasionally reach out and hit buttons on helm to turn on and off our holographic star map. Some of those plants are real rascals.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into creating the various machines and ship devices so that they felt alien and creative, yet conveyed their usage in their design? How did you make a starship's controls feel intuitive?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Ashley nailed down our organic, drippy, goopy shape language that serves as the basis for everything. We wanted the ship to feel soft, alive, and familiar all at once. We borrow some items from classic sci-fi like levers, buttons, and holographic projectors, but other items like our fertilizer creatures, and the contraption you use to access the dreams of alien plants, required multiple rounds of iteration to find something that was novel while still remaining accessible. We tried to focus on interactions that were simple yet surprising.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about focusing on caring for various plants in the game? About giving the plants various personalities for the player to uncover?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were excited with the idea of making a game that encourages players to be caretakers and plant lovers—to find joy in nurturing. These are things we want to see more of in the world. With a mixed reality game, users are trusting us to build an experience in their home. We take this unspoken intimate contract really seriously and wanted to work to ensure that we created positive, magical memories for places. I think that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> imbues a little bit of magic into every space it is played in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The personalities of the plants are a big part of this—they respond to your touch, they each have different needs, and they respond to care in different ways. Every player has a favorite (which ends up being placed in a place of prominence). They are somewhere in between plants and pets—a space we’d love to explore even more in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design the plants in order to convey their unique personalities? How do you create something that looks like a plant from another planet? How do you then show the player that plant's personality through its behavior and visual design?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When approaching the design of each plant, we tried to think holistically about the end-to-end experience of the player. The planet they find the plant on, the dream of the plant you enter into, the music in that dream, the interactions with the player—all of this comes together to paint a full picture of a complex entity. We tried to only occasionally borrow shapes and concepts for plants from Earth (like the flower on the eyeball plant), but for many of them we tried to focus on an interaction-first approach—you feed this plant, this plant wants to poke things, this plant plays tones when touched—and then we designed the plant to encourage and foster those interactions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Finally, what thoughts went into the different worlds players could explore with their lander? Into creating whole worlds to amaze the player, and the ways in which they could interact with those worlds? When you were not bound by the limits of the player's living space, how did that alter your designs? &nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We went through several radically different concepts for the lander. We knew we wanted to keep the player in their room at all times but that we wanted to allow them to explore these worlds. We settled on the lander feed concept as something that would allow players to collect some lore, catch the vibe of the planet, and get a sense of the plant’s home world all while still keeping them grounded in their home environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do this, we close all the exterior windows of the ship, dim the passthrough, and focus the player's view on the feed. We wanted players to enjoy these scenes as interactive vistas. This, like many of the interactions in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are meant to invite the player to embody the narrative of the world where they are a researcher, explorer, and caretaker. We hope that players engage with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> less as a classic game and more as an adventure that they allow themselves to imagine going on. If you are willing to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that way, the journey is worth the trip.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During this time, we have created several titles of varying scale, but only one of them has received a full-fledged sequel. We're talking about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the FPP slasher released in 2020, which completely changed our fate, allowing us to set sail into broader waters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The year 2020 was a special time for the industry. On one hand, it brought development delays due to the need of adapting to remote work, while on the other, it increased demand for games because of home isolation. There's no denying that we benefited from this while working on the first installment of Ghostrunner. For us as developers, it was a break from the grim pandemic routine, allowing us to bring the game from prototype to release in just 1.5 years. Players appreciated our effort, and in October 2020, they jumped into the post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world we had created.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of ">Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of <span>Ghostrunner 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the success of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we quickly received a proposal from our publisher and current IP owner, 505 Games, to create a sequel. In the meantime, we also released a series of additional content supporting the original game, including a major expansion, Project_Hel, where we had the opportunity to test out some fresh gameplay ideas. These ideas influenced the design decisions made during the conceptual phase of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As examples, I can mention more frequent opportunities to use the protagonist's special abilities and a general focus on extending the player's lifespan in arenas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When preparing for the production of the sequel, we deeply looked for player feedback on forums, Reddit, and our Discord. Luckily, we received plenty of it, but as often happens with the opinions of such a large group of players, several suggestions started to contradict each other. Some players wanted even faster, more challenging, and competitive gameplay, while others requested it to be more organized and slower. We decided to focus on feedback from those who spent the most time in the game, while also keeping in mind the recurring concerns from more casual players, who were quickly turning away from our game because it seemed too difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players wanted us to expand the core combat and movement mechanics, and that's what we focused on. We created more complex level designs, added new enemies with new abilities, and modified those who didn’t fully suit the gameplay, like for example the Wardens—enemies equipped with katanas. The only way to defeat them was to wait for their attack and block it. We replaced them with Shinobi, who can also be outmaneuvered and killed with a strike to the back or disarmed using one of the special abilities. At the same time, they are extremely fast and can run on walls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to the tempo of the gameplay, we wanted to maintain the speed for players who wanted to rush through levels like pros, while also catering to those who complained about the frantic pace in the first game. We found a compromise by adding two very important mechanics – block and stamina – which allow less experienced players to stop, take a breath, calmly assess the situation, and move on. This action is not mandatory for the ultra-skilled players, who can still play the sequel exactly as they rushed through the first installment of the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel">From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's clear that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not a game for everyone, and it was never meant to be. However, aware of the potential benefits of expanding the target audience, we wanted to introduce new features that would make the game more accessible without straying too far from the core mechanics. After all, it’s these mechanics that earned the game the appreciation of a dedicated fanbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We quickly realized that, as a team, we had found ourselves in a completely new situation. We were making a sequel and for the first time we had to meet the expectations of not hundreds or thousands of players, but millions of people from all over the world. After all, each of those players had their own vision of what their ideal </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be. I didn’t expect that this pressure would weigh so heavily on us and, to some extent, even disrupt the creative aspect of game development. Every new feature had to go through a process of double verification—our internal review, followed by a clash with player expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an interesting behind-the-scenes tidbit, we can tell you that we tested a sword-throwing system, but quickly abandoned the idea in favor of faster and more practical shurikens. We also had concepts that never made it to implementation, like a survival mechanic that would appear during exploration of the wastelands outside the tower. It was built around the idea that the player would not be able to stay in the sun for too long and would have to look for the shade, but we abandoned it due to the potential risk of significantly slowing down the game, as it didn’t support our core gameplay. Some changes were obvious and necessary improvements, like fixing the save system to enable saving during missions, which didn’t always work correctly in the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and often frustrated players. However, these small but impactful changes were few and far between.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Offering players more of what they're looking for">Offering players more of what they're looking for</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What turned out to be a real challenge was our desire to add a motorcycle. The idea was simple, though it might have sounded absurd—our game is already fast, so let’s give Jack (the protagonist of Ghostrunner) a vehicle that allows him to move even faster. The goal was to carry over the rhythm that defines Ghostrunner onto a motorcycle. After months of tweaking the balance and controls (which we eventually made very arcade-ish) and gathering extensive feedback from tests, we managed to deliver a gameplay experience packed with adrenaline, rooted in the fast-paced, trial-and-error mechanic that perfectly aligns with Ghostrunner's core. It’s worth noting that not everything related to the motorcycle was perfect. With a vehicle and an open post-apocalyptic world, we were tempted to explore much larger areas than the levels inside the tower. Looking back, I have to admit it wasn’t the best idea, and although there is a group of fans who enjoyed this more sandbox-like experience, most players didn’t see this element as a good addition. Fortunately, it was only two levels, after which we return to the fast, more linear, and condensed gameplay tracks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, we attempted to achieve what was previously considered impossible, given the budget and the team we had at the time. Step by step, feature by feature, the size and complexity of the game grew closer to the AAA segment. We added elements like a hub with NPCs, dialogue choices, cutscenes blended into the narrative, and a separate roguelike game mode called Roguerunner.exe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To create this unique and complex mode, we drew from the experience gained from Arena Mode in the first game. As an additional mode, Roguerunner.exe offered players a lot: unique, dedicated levels (300 types of combat arenas and 80 parkour challenges), new (and sometimes downright crazy) upgrades to the protagonist’s abilities, and an entirely different emotional experience due to the limited number of attempts for each run. We also utilized some skills that didn’t make it into the main game, such as H.O.T., inspired by the famous Polish indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Superhot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where time moves only when the player does.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The dangerous trap of wanting too much">The dangerous trap of wanting too much</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all these new and additional features, along with the separate game mode ready for launch day, the entire project was a massive undertaking for our incredibly talented, yet still under 50-person development team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew that, despite efforts to reach a broader audience, we were still making a hardcore game, which always limits the player base. We introduced a number of changes to balance the gameplay, making it more accessible to newcomers, such as the previously mentioned ability to block attacks, shorter skill cooldowns, powerful special abilities, and a simplified character progression system. However, we didn’t compromise the core of the gameplay, which remains the most hardcore mechanic in our game – one-hit-kill. We couldn’t cross that line, so as not to disappoint the fans of the first game, and we’re proud that we were able to beat this challenge. While designing these adjustments, we feared that they might lead to a sense of blandness and weakness. We were walking on thin ice, but in the end, we stayed on the hardcore side, only slightly reducing its extreme nature. Even though the base version of the sequel may not be as difficult as the first game, the "Hardcore Mode" added shortly after the release is probably even more difficult than the one in the first installment. It offers a challenge designed to be nearly impossible for us, the developers, but we know that our most dedicated players possess skills that far exceed even the most experienced members of our QA team, who have spent thousands of hours in this title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also learned a big lesson from the bosses in Ghostrunner, who weren’t that well-received by players. While making the sequel, we set a goal: each new boss must require a different approach from the player. Our inspiration came from boss fights in FromSoftware games, where bosses telegraph their attacks, and the player must learn the timing and animation sequences. I believe we succeeded in delivering truly unique bosses, whose designs were based on diverse, challenging mechanics.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lessons learned from creating the sequel">Lessons learned from creating the sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting to the point—as they say, appetite comes with eating, and our ambitions have also grown since the release of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020. Every day, we asked ourselves whether adding one more feature, a skill, or an additional mechanic would be enough to call the game a true sequel. How much of the gameplay needs to change for players to feel it’s a genuine continuation and not just capitalizing on the success of the original?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s probably no simple answer to these questions, as it all depends on the product. For example, when creating another game in a sports franchise, not much needs to change to make a successful sequel. We made the decision to keep the core of the game intact while adding many premium features around it, effectively expanding the overall gameplay experience with new possibilities and experiences (such as the arcade-style motorcycle riding).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, we achieved our goals, delivering a high-quality product that received great reviews and a nomination for Best Action Game at the 2023 Game Awards. However, it didn’t replicate the commercial success of the first installment, leaving us with a sense of unfulfilled potential. Naturally, the question arises: What could we have done better or differently? Perhaps we should have revisited the core of our gameplay and implemented more drastic changes—shed the pressure of competing with AAA giants and instead focus on further elevating the fundamental mechanics. Only time will tell, as we’re certain we still have a lot to offer our players and the fans of the franchise we’ve created and cherished.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
