"That's one of the biggest challenges," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Currently, Sega's GAAS focus is on free-to-play mobile games, including the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic Rumble</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is free to play but offers in-app purchases. In a 2024 interview with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/sonic-rumble-20241003-313059/">Automaton</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-avoided-gacha-and-pay-to-win-mechanics-in-sonic-rumble-because-they-know-overseas-players-dont-like-them/">translated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Japanese, game director Makoto Tase said that "monetization models that use gacha mechanics have not been very successful when it comes to games targeted towards worldwide audiences of all ages," and that these mechanics "tend to be shunned overseas," leading to ultimately deciding not to include them in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rumble</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Utsumi didn't specifically mentioned gacha mechanics, he sees developer Rovio, which Sega </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sega-has-completed-its-acquisition-of-mobile-developer-rovio">acquired</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in August 2023, as the candidate for this business push. "Rovio has deep knowledge of the global mobile business, and very strong IP with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Angry Birds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” Utsumi said. "We feel like the fit between Rovio and Sega is good. We are working closely with Rovio to have a Sonic mobile game, and we are giving them access to IPs, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to come up with nice, welcoming GAAS titles."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-senior-client-partner-rod-stafford-jailed-for-sexual-offences" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity senior client partner Rod Stafford jailed for 22 years over sexual offenses</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sega's plans of expansion also include developing properties beyond games, with Utsumi referencing the success of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> movies, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-franchise-tops-1-billion-at-global-box-office">topped $1 billion</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the global box office on January of this year.

"But I was treated like… 'hey, video games is like a toy business'.

"Some really big efforts. But ultimately that title entered into a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. So we have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations—and to ensure that we are not going to make the same mistakes again."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/11-bit-apologizes-for-not-disclosing-gen-ai-use-in-the-alters" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Alters developer apologizes for not disclosing use of generative AI</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
