Others have either remained employed (55.6 percent) or left of their own choice (23.2 percent).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most affected by these layoffs worked in HR (by 32 percent) and QA (28 percent).

PR, founder/co-founder, and community were considered the least likely to be at risk. Tenure-wise, trainees and junior staff are the most at-risk workers, according to the results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ten percent of respondents said they ended up switching to work at non-games industries, and 31 percent of those were former junior staff at a game company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Layoffs have hit studios across the globe quite hard in recent years.

Workers outside those territories had similar sentiments: 61 percent pointed to burnout, then management (47 percent), and a lack of appreciation (24 percent).</span></p><p>The big challenges developers in and out of Europe are currently facing at their workplace.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another big challenge concerns discrimination: 32 percent of respondents say they have encountered gender discrimination, followed by discrimination of age (26 percent), and national origin or language (17 percent).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The full Big Games Industry Employment Survey, which also includes insight into salaries for European developers and the most-desired studios to work at, can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pr5DbVvbajXdViyd2zZQWBbUSSKfofVw/view">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

Senior franchise writer Ken Peters credited both Digsite's tools and the series' community with "unearthing knowledge to know why Bungie built things the way they did in the demo."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without them," he continued, "we would probably have only had a rather unceremonious drop of raw assets and that was it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was a big driver for Xbox at the time, and was its most-played multiplayer game until the arrival of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gears of War </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for the Xbox 360 two years later.
