"Prior art" here references existing published games and patent applications from before the priority date of December 22, 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These games include Pocketpair's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Studio Wildcard's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ark: Survival Evolved</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Square Enix's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and somewhat unexpectedly, Respawn Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titanfall 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As gamesfray points out, it's notable that Pocketpair doesn't just reference individual games, but also player-made mods for existing games like a 2020 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dark Souls 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mod "Pocket Souls" and a Pokémon-themed mod for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The mods appear to be cited as examples of types of gameplay available to Pocketpair as inspiration during the time period.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Titanfall 2"><span>Titanfall 2</span>, <span>Tomb Raider</span>, and <span>Far Cry 5</span> are surprising citations in the Palworld patent case</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The citation of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titanfall 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might surprise developers since Nintendo's patent claims had to do with the game mechanic of capturing in-game characters with capture balls and riding these characters. Gamesfray explains that Pocketpair's contention isn't that these contain the foundations for a combination of game mechanics that culminate in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gameplay—or in some cases, outright display the patented mechanics concerning "capturing" and "smooth switching" of rideable objects.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-switch-2-dodges-tariff-price-increase-but-accessories-will-experience-price-adjustments-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 dodges tariff price increase, but accessories will experience 'price adjustments'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titanfall 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Respawn implemented a mechanic for the player to "catch" incoming bullets and throw them back at the enemy. If a developer took inspiration from that mechanic and created a system that applied that "catch and throw" loop to creatures instead of bullets, Pocketpair's argument is essentially that even if the game was released after the December 2021 patent filing, its existence is based "prior art" and can't be considered a violation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, it's arguing that its own game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the "starting point" to arrive at the mechanics covered in the patent, and that one need only "combine" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with prior mechanics to organically arrive at the patented material without violating them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pocketpair also cited several pre-2021 games from Nintendo's library including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pikmin 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deluxe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games with mechanics that could be "combined" with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/removal-of-unity-6-from-china-not-tied-to-tariffs-says-unity" target="_self" data-discover="true">Removal of Unity 6 from China 'not tied' to tariffs, says Unity</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's difficult to tell if these arguments justify invalidating Nintendo's 3 patents. Though Pocketpair's reasoning makes sense on the surface, these arguments are taking place before a patent law court, which may take a more hard-and-fast view when it comes to patented game mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However things shake out, Pocketpair has raised one important point: the volume of video game releases in the last 10 years has created a situation where developers iterate fast and take inspiration from each other's game mechanics at a rapid-fire rate, meaning there are complex combinations of mechanics hitting the marketplace on a yearly basis. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/loading-screen-game-patent-finally-expires">Unlike the early days of restrictive video game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> patent filings, it's more difficult to argue that any developer has a unique claim on a specific mechanic.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
