The monsters absorb energy from downed bodies to evolve into greater threats, creating a combat loop where players don't just need to juggle threats coming in from all sides, but also keep an eye on the enemies they kill so they don't become food for the next enemy that spawns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a system like this juggles a number of unique disciplines—level design, AI programming, combat design, and more.

The aforementioned harvesting mechanic at the heart of the enemy AI systems allows for multiple evolutions. Enemies don't just get stronger, they can also learn new attack patterns and mutate into new character models. The pair showed off how basic enemies have two tiers of evolution, meaning players who can't knock down every enemy will face an entirely new kind of monster that could turn the tide in a fight.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that gunplay and traversal in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn't just an updated version of what Bloober made in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Player movement and shooting is meant to mimic what is often referred to as the "tank controls" of survival horror games from the late '90s and early 2000s. These games limited player movement, slowed down aiming, and used restrictive camera angles to make it harder to spot enemies at a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though novel for their time, advancements in video game combat as a whole make "tank controls" a less appealing experience for most modern players. To recreate that sensation without relying on decades-old restrictions, Bloober made two key design decisions. The more subtle one was to mandate that guns not fire with a simple trigger press. They need to be charged up, giving enemies time to close the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The more surprising choice—one that greatly diverges from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—was to not give players a "dodge" button. Players instead are given a resource-dependent flamethrower burst that can push enemies away or eliminate dead bodies used for power-ups. The resource-juggling is familiar to survival horror, but denying players a dodge button goes against recent trends. None of this, the pair said, could be done without Bloober increasing headcount and seeking out developers with specific skills.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-vicious-cycle-translator-unions-call-out-keywords-for-lowballing-contract-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A vicious cycle:' Translator unions call out Keywords for lowballing contract workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We bolster a team [with] specific people," said Zieba, noting that Bloober hired a dedicated "gunsmith" whose sole job would be making the charge-heavy guns.

"It's easier to get better specialists who love survival horror like us," he said. Zieba said the studio at large still operates in a "hybrid" mode. "But for some of them, we know there is no going back," he said. "There is no reason to go back because we are stronger because of it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="You can't make good games without the right people">You can't make good games without the right people</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bloober Team's policy of continuing to allow for remote work offers a clear example of what CEO Piotr Babieno meant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bloober-ceo-creating-a-safe-sustainable-workplace-takes-priority-in-studio-leadership">when he spoke to Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the process of sustainably growing a "safe" studio specializing in single-player horror games. If your studio is breaking into a new genre with complex systems no one on your team has experience with, you'll need to hire externally.
