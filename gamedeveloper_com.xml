Tencent said that process usually takes between three and seven days.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This results in an eightfold improvement in character skinning throughput and transforms animation into a fully automated process of 'keyframe generation + intelligent in-betweening,'" it continued.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent claims it doesn't want VISVISE to replace 'human ingenuity'">Tencent claims it doesn't want VISVISE to replace 'human ingenuity'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tencent Games VISVISE expert Zijiao Zeng delivered a keynote at Devcom (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev">soon to be rebranded as Gamescom Dev</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) and shared more details on VISVISE's two key core technologies: VISVISE GoSkinning and VISVISE MotionBlink.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/unity-promises-stronger-ai-copyright-guardrails-after-employee-conjures-mickey-mouse-on-stream" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity promises strong AI copyright 'guardrails' after employee conjures Mickey Mouse on stream</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GoSkinning works by leveraging a universal AI model to automatically adapt to different skeletal structures. Tencent told Game Developer the tool is based on an AI model developed in-house.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company explained GoSkinning achieves around 85 percent automation and uses a two-step process of bone chain prediction and weight refinement, while its proprietary 'Skirt AI' addresses "complex garment deformation issues."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">MotionBlink, meanwhile, uses a self-regressive diffusion architecture to rapidly generate keyframes combined with pre-trained CVAE and contrastive learning to produce smooth motion transitions that Tencent claims will rival optimal motion capture and eliminate common issues such as foot sliding and jitter.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VISVISE tools have already been integrated into the development of over 90 titles, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Addressing the widespread concerns surrounding AI technology and automation, Tencent said it doesn't envision a future in which VISVIE replaces workers and instead explained it views the technology as a "supporting tool."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"VISVISE is designed to automate repetitive tasks with human oversight, enabling creative teams to focus on core artistic and design elements that define a great game," a Tencent spokesperson told Game Developer. "Human ingenuity, intuition and connection continue to be pillars of our industry's success, and the keys to developing engaging, emotionally resonant games. With AI, we hope to accelerate creativity, building a collaborative environment where we can continue to create, play and sell&nbsp;quality&nbsp;games."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/keita-takahashi-sent-over-a-bunch-of-adorable-to-a-t-storyboard-sketches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the Scenes: Check out Keita Takahashi's adorable To a T storyboard sketches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
