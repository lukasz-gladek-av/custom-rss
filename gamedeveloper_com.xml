He says the pivot from 2D to 3D wasn't exactly a "walk in the park" and took longer than expected, not least because the team couldn't effectively assess how macro gameplay elements were taking shape until they had fleshed out a good portion of the playspace.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted this to truly be an open world that players could explore in any direction they wanted. It’s a technically challenging genre to work in, you don’t really get a sense of the macro gameplay until you've built quite a lot of stuff. We had a variety of strategies to edit things in rough broad strokes or edit localized areas at a time," says Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nailing the average bike speed was something we tried to get early on, because it impacted the distances between everything in the game, which also factored into the pacing. We did use some tricks like making the bike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faster using FOV (field of view) and camera angles. The kph gauge has a multiplier on it so that it was still in the realm of how fast a real bike can go."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essen says Messhof spent a huge amount of time reshaping the landscape to ensure that objectives and collectibles appeared at correct intervals. With so many moving parts, however, making even small tweaks became increasingly expensive. Spend too much time tinkering with an open world project and you might start unraveling the very fabric of your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how Messhof sought to gently steer players through their island realm, which can largely be explored at will (although that might present some challenges players aren't equipped for), Essen explains the core narrative—which requires players to outrace bike-riding bosses to collect sacred bike parts—provide some semblance of structure without feeling too on rails.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/read-up-on-new-guidance-for-implementing-accessibility-tags-in-storefronts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Read the ESA's new guidance for storefront accessibility tags</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-WUWFguRqY?si=kix-X18zjuV6YogR" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional bike parts can also be found scattered across the landscape, which pushes players to keep moving in search of shiny new components that can be used to trick out their cherished two-wheeler for specific events.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We encouraged players to explore quickly, but story beats naturally guide you to easier races in the Farmlands first—where you can also face the first boss. Velo City is the toughest area, with tight turns, aggressive AI, and heavy traffic, so we gated it with 'bike snobs' who won't let you in until you've upgraded all five bike parts," continues Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Beyond that, we left room for player strategy. The BMX track, for example, might be easier with a high-handling, high-power bike for sharp turns and quick acceleration, but you could also choose a drift build that grants boost on slides, or use the Cucaracha frame to jump rolling bumps. We made sure tracks varied in elevation, turns, obstacles, and surfaces so different builds felt viable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Messhof's ultimate aim was to craft unique and diverse open world that actually rewards exploration. "We wanted a large open world with towns, countryside, and lots to explore. The style had to be achievable by a small art team and feel like a cohesive, believable place—not something thrown together from stock assets," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-story-changes-were-made-to-sustain-player-interest-over-time" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth story changes were made to sustain player interest over time</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game's world is an alternate universe where life and death revolve around bicycles. Visual inspirations included old Tour de France posters and early 20th-century travel posters—thick, hand-drawn outlines and bold shapes. We also looked at comics including Moebius, John Singer Sargent's landscapes, David Hockney, and Pop Art in general. And of course other games too like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jet Set Radio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a lofty goal considering the studio's art team oscillated between two and three people throughout production, but I think it's reasonable to say Messhof delivered on that promise. There's plenty of fun to be had in hurling your haunted bicycle through breakneck races but, during my time with the title, I found nothing quite compared to simply taking in the sights under </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheel World's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gleaming topaz skies.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
