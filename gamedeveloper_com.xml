Price rises for memory and storage will touch many parts of the games industry, including hardware, software, and development costs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hardware margins will be squeezed">Hardware margins will be squeezed</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia's Memory and Storage research teams estimate that PC DRAM and SSD prices for mainstream configurations saw, on average, increases of nearly 100% and 40%, respectively, in 2025.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This trend is flowing into contract pricing and has only continued in the first quarter of 2026, where DRAM prices are expected to rise by a further 60% and NAND memory 70%.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Memory and storage are key components in dedicated games hardware such as games consoles. In 2Q25, Omdia estimated that the combined memory in a base PS5 accounted for at least 20% of the overall bill of materials of the console.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tencent-shutters-timi-montreal" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Tencent quietly shutters Timi Montreal</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once manufacturers run through their inventories, new devices will be built with memory supplies that will have been negotiated at a higher contract price. In the console market, this will apply across the board:&nbsp;GDDR6 for PS5, additional DDR5 for PS5 Pro, and LPDDR5 for Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The margins on console hardware remain thin – Sony Interactive Entertainment reported in February 2026 that steep discounting on PlayStation 5 hardware during the holiday season in 4Q25 led to "increases in losses from hardware."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Console manufacturers are best placed to offset hardware inflation">Console manufacturers are best placed to offset hardware inflation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, console manufacturers also sell software, services, and peripherals, giving them many levers they can pull to mitigate squeezed hardware margins. Figure 1 highlights how content and services are the bulk of consumer spend on games console platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, one likely event in 2026 is Nintendo adjusting the pricing of Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions upward. Omdia estimates average ASP growth between the end of 2021 and 2025 for all Nintendo Switch Online tiers was just 8%, compared with 40% for PlayStation Plus and 72% for Xbox Game Pass.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, we will see a reattribution of pricing of upcoming first-party content, subscription services, and peripherals. The launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during holiday 2026 could also help sustain demand in the event that 2025's discounting on PlayStation 5 hardware cannot be repeated.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There also already exists a sizable combined active installed base of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, which have just entered their seventh calendar year on the market. It is the publishing opportunity on Nintendo platforms that will be the most exposed as the vast majority of major new and upcoming first-and third-party software has transitioned to Switch 2, a platform in its infancy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embark-studios-ceo-patrick-soderlund-named-executive-chairman-of-nexon" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund named executive chairman of Nexon</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Entry-level hardware in the console market will be a casualty. Historically, the last-generation system could provide an affordable entry point into a games catalog for a platform holder. The price of entry-level platforms like Nintendo Switch is likely to rise on a global basis, following the North American model's lead after the introduction of tariffs on imported goods in the US.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With signs emerging that the spending power of middle-income households is declining in key console markets like the US, not having an affordable entry point into a console platform's ecosystem could affect the pipeline of future generations of enthusiast early adopters.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via Omdia</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PC vendors have less wriggle room, but games publishers can adapt">PC vendors have less wriggle room, but games publishers can adapt</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Major PC hardware vendors do not control underlying PC games software ecosystems such as Steam, making hardware profitability far more important. The rise in the price of components is likely to instead be passed on via both PC and PC component selling prices.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fate-of-console-pricing-uncertain-after-supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Fate of console pricing uncertain after Supreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the upgrade cycle will be affected. PC gamers may delay a full upgrade and PC desktop builders may delay component upgrades. Handheld gaming PCs, an emerging product category, may continue to only address an enthusiast audience. For gaming laptops, PC vendors are expected to focus on driving sales of high-end models to maximize revenue as supply is constrained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, this is likely to pose little challenge for most developers given pre-existing work optimizing games for power-constrained devices such as Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also a growing installed base of gaming-capable laptops that remain unaddressed by many games publishers. The capabilities of built-in processor graphics have improved significantly in recent years, providing performance that exceeds Steam Deck and, at the high end, exceeds Xbox Series S. Data from Omdia's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PC Horizon Service</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveals over 90 million gaming-capable laptops were sold in 2025. Publishers should consider addressing the subset of laptop owners that also plays games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sales volumes and value of PC games content is not expected to be disrupted – there already exists a huge and healthy audience of installed devices well-positioned to buy PC games content. Omdia estimates that in 2025, Steam alone had 321 million yearly active users.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected">The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the 1980s, chip shortages placed upward pressure on the manufacturing cost of Famicom cartridges and facilitated the creation of the Famicom Disc System, which used a cheaper proprietary floppy-disc format.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This situation is repeating itself with Switch 2 physical media, as the standard game cards are becoming prohibitively expensive to accommodate publishers' pricing strategies. Like its predecessor, Switch 2 remains a physical-first platform. When including bundled software, Omdia estimates 57% of Switch 2 games sold in 2025 were at retail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expectation in 2026 is that publishers shipping software in high volumes will continue to opt for the dataless Game-Key Card to protect margins and hit lower price points at retail—both at, and following, the launch of a title. The exception is niche titles that reach a highly engaged audience of collectors – this audience is less sensitive to price, so publishers should explore the possibility of charging a higher price to publish a game fully on the game card.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game-Key Cards do present one issue for the publishing opportunity on Switch 2. The device features just 230GB of useable internal storage – the lowest of any current generation console. With the cost of expandable SD Express storage also expected to rise, software attach rates could be affected once enough "forever games" supplant themselves on players' systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers will be forced to take action to control server costs">Developers will be forced to take action to control server costs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As outlined in Omdia's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2026 Trends to Watch – Games Tech,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competition for data center capacity from AI is going to make infrastructure costs a top concern for game studio CTOs in 2026. Games companies have already been rapidly ramping up spending on game servers in recent years, and the expectation is that studios will increasingly experiment with the use of bare metal and hybrid strategies to manage cloud costs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Smarter infrastructure strategies are increasingly seen as essential to counteract cost increases driven by the memory boom cycle. Developers have more options than ever in this regard with the growing range of bare metal providers and server orchestration solutions on hand, as hyperscalers also move to offer more cost-effective solutions.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A pricing reversal remains unlikely">A pricing reversal remains unlikely</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Memory manufacturers will continue to lean as much as possible toward serving the enterprise segment, and Omdia's Memory and Storage teams expect supply for consumer products to remain deprioritized. This pace is expected to cool off significantly in 2Q26, but suppliers still hold the upper hand with any forthcoming negotiations and a reversal remains unlikely throughout 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Long-term secured supply is no guarantee, so any potential fluctuations in price will be an ongoing concern for the launch of specialist products in 2026, such as Steam Machine and Steam Frame.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Boom and bust cycles in component pricing have occurred before, and the games industry has had experience in managing them, albeit typically in conditions of stronger growth when it was easier to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2026, expect a re-evaluation of pricing across first-party content, peripherals, and services from platform holders, a shift in focus toward high-end models from major PC gaming hardware vendors, and developer spend on game servers to further increase.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.
