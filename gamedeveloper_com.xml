That total includes a base salary of $1.3 million, $25.7 million in stock awards, $2.8 million via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 in other compensation that largely includes personal security benefits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a figure that made Wilson the highest-earner on the company's executive team by some margin. Notably, it also confirms Wilson netted a fairly substantial compensation increase on the $25.6 million he received the year prior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does Wilson's compensation package compare to that of your median EA worker? According to EA's pay ratio breakdown for the 2025 fiscal year, the annual total compensation of its "median employee" was $117,302. Or, to put it another way, Wilson earned 260 times more than the median EA worker over the past 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a notable shift compared to the 2024 fiscal year, which saw the median EA employee earn $148,704. In short, that means EA has handed more cash to its top executive while paying workers lessâ€”at least according to the methodology applied by the publisher.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-11-peak-hits-new-heights-layoffs-all-the-way-down-and-union-workers-make-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #11: Peak hits new heights, the layoffs keep on coming, and union workers make history</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less">Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA uses a consistently applied compensation measure (CACM) to identify its median employee, which it explains includes full time, part-time, regular, and temporary staffers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's CACM considers the base salary of workers as of March 15, 2025; discretionary bonuses paid to employees throughout the fiscal year; the grant date fair market value of equity awards granted to employees in fiscal year 2025; and exchange rates used to convert all non-US currencies into US dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other than annualizing base salary for permanent employees, we did not make any compensation adjustments whether for cost of living or otherwise in the identification process," added the company, which noted it's definition of "median employee" has remained consistent since 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, all of the executives listed by EA received compensation increases of varying degrees in 2025.

Union workers at Microsoft subsidiary ZeniMax this week voted to ratify their first union contract after years of negotiations. ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed in 2023 and has spent the past two years locked in negotiations with Microsoft. After threatening strike action the union finally made a breakthrough when it reached a tentative agreement with the Xbox maker. Now, it has ratified that agreement, which includes across-the-board wage increases, protections against arbitrary dismissal, and AI safeguards.

This time, the company collaborated with Facebook-owner Meta to release the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. The limited edition bundle comes with a 128GB version of the headset, a Meta Quest Elite Steam, an Xbox controller, and three months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Microsoft seems to think the unique selling point here is the ability to stream compatible Xbox titles on a virtual screen that'll float around your living room like an audio-sensory blimp.

That's because the title has surpassed 2 million sales in just nine days after being developed in around a month on a budget of under $200,000. That's a mean featâ€”but how was it accomplished?
