Its sequel debuted exclusively on iOS three years later before shuffling onto Android a few months after. Then, in 2024, ustwo decided to partner with Netflix for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> instead, making for a second (and more significant) collaboration after launching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Desta: The Memories Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a temporary Netflix exclusive in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sayans explains that the studio has been "extremely lucky" to be able to make games with both platforms. This, at the time, gave the developer a "lucrative and stable business," as well as a base to build an expansion into other platforms. Now, looking at 2026, it seems that potential is waning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"(...) ultimately you are one step removed from your audience, and you are dependent on their content strategy, so it is not a solid base to build a long term business around," the CEO says. "So ultimately we needed to wean ourselves off that dependency, by continuing to invest on our own IP, building porting and publishing skills in-house, and strengthening our direct relationship with our audience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-weeks-after-workers-vote-to-unionize" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft closes Halifax studio weeks after workers vote to unionize</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Monument Valley 3 leaving Netflix was a &quot;total surprise&quot; to ustwo">Monument Valley 3 leaving Netflix was a "total surprise" to ustwo</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, speaking to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/monument-valley-3-is-heading-to-netflix-games-to-avoid-app-store-compromise-">Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after the reveal of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead producer John Lau said the decision to renew its partnership with Netflix was due to how much the App Store had changed in the past decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Lau, Netflix's potential was divided into two primary reasons: a massive existing subscriber base, as video games are part of the regular service, and a landscape that isn't focused on surfacing free-to-play projects and titles that prioritize "high user-acquisition," referring to the App Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It also allows it to stay Monument Valley rather than change its mechanics or do whatever else you need to do to survive in a different [ecosystem]," Lau said. "[The Netflix Games deal is about] trying to make the kind of game we wanted to make, without having to compromise in order for it to survive in the kind of App Store that exists in the modern day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, Netflix removed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the service six months after launch. According to Sayans, this came "as a total surprise" to the studio, after working with Netflix for a few years developing the title and having a strong marketing campaign behind it.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shape-of-dreams-has-topped-1-million-sales" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shape of Dreams has topped 1 million sales</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A number of games were taken off the service at the same time, so I assume it is related to the evolution of their content strategy and priorities," the CEO says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, in relation to what Lau mentioned about the game's design, Sayans explains that there were indeed decisions that were "meant to suit a subscription service" in terms of engagement, retention features, and content update frequency.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once ustwo learned the game was coming off the service, it took it as an opportunity to redesign the game ending and post launch content "in a way that better suited a premium product."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sayans argues that in some categories, such as party games, premium mobile is a "healthy business," and wouldn't write off the model completely—especially with options like the "try before you buy" model. Yet, it's "not enough of a market" to justify significant development budget, so developers should see it as one of their platforms rather than the only one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, recent years has seen Netflix losing more video game talent than just ustwo. In October 2024, the company shuttered its Southern Californian AAA game studio Team Blue after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-closes-its-only-aaa-game-studio">less than two years of operation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
