The company says the sum will support its "rapid expansion," including the "scaling of its proprietary AI platform and continued investment in R&amp;D to shape the future of instant character animation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Willem Demmers, CEO of Motorica, claimed that animators spend 70 percent of their time on technical grunt work and only 30 percent on actual creative performance. The tool's goal is to invert the numbers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By automating the grind—things like tedious keyframing for basic locomotion—we let creators focus on what matters: storytelling, emotion, and innovation," Demmers said in the announcement. "That shift helps studios move faster, push quality higher, and ship with less friction."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Motorica claims the tool is already being used in live production environments by AAA studios.
