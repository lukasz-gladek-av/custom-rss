"Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games." It added that it would be sharing "more details" in the weeks ahead about what these departures mean for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fae Farm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dauntless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, its two released games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dauntless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a free-to-play live service game, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fae Farm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a premium game with online multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today's layoffs come </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">a few months after Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reported on turmoil at the studio after a 2023 acquisition by blockchain firm Forte Labs. Former Phoenix Labs employees told us that the then-new parent company instituted a culture of strict secrecy, cutting off communication between teams and going so far as to seemingly conceal its ownership of the developer from prospective employees.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">What happens when a secretive blockchain company buys your game studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after our reporting, Phoenix Labs launched its flagship monster-hunting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dauntless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Steam, only to be criticized by players for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamerant.com/dauntless-review-bomb-controversy-why-monetization-awakening-update/">its new in-app monetization design</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and erasing previous progression with the new "Awakening" update. The game still has an "Overwhelmingly Negative" number of reviews on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Poor reception of this update may have dented the company's fortunes at the end of 2024, making today's layoffs more likely.

In that time, its new owner reportedly pressed developers to draft methods for integrating blockchain technology in its games for the purposes of buying and selling, and trading in-game goods, according to former employees who spoke with Game Developer. No blockchain games or game mechanics have been publicly revealed by Phoenix Labs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer has reached out to Phoenix Labs for comment and will update this story when a response is issued.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
