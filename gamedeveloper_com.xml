Union workers at Microsoft subsidiary ZeniMax this week voted to ratify their first union contract after years of negotiations. ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed in 2023 and has spent the past two years locked in negotiations with Microsoft. After threatening strike action the union finally made a breakthrough when it reached a tentative agreement with the Xbox maker. Now, it has ratified that agreement, which includes across-the-board wage increases, protections against arbitrary dismissal, and AI safeguards.

Naturally, then, the studio decided to use the tech to generate portraits of humdrum human beings. It's a decision that raises eyebrows for a multitude of reasons, but after fans caught wind and took the studio to task Frontier backtracked faster than a raptor on rollerblades.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Riot shutters Hypixel Studios and cancels Hytale after a decade in development"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/riot-shutters-hypixel-studios-and-cancels-hytale-after-a-decade-in-development">Riot shutters Hypixel Studios and cancels Hytale after a decade in development</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Hypixel Studios was shuttered by parent company Riot this week after spending a decade working on a sandbox RPG called Hytale. The studio began working on the project after finding success with a Minecraft server of the same name. It eventually secured investment from Riot to flesh out the project and was acquired by the League of Legends make a few years later. Sadly, the team explained they fell short of realising their vision and have now cancelled development on the long-gestating title.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-don-t-nod-lays-off-an-undisclosed-number-of-staff" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Lost Records developer Don't Nod is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Report: Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room is making layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Report: Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room is making layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">UK studio The Chinese Room has seemingly laid off a number of employees. Social media posts from multiple staffers claiming to be impacted by the cuts were shared online, indicating there have been redundancies at the Sumo Group subsidiary. The news comes after Sumo announced a restructuring plan earlier this year that will see the company move away from developing original franchises, which is precisely what The Chinese Room is known for. A Sumo spokesperson also confirmed a number of the company's communications team have been laid off, which explains why our emails to three separate members of that team bounced.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microsoft Plans Major&nbsp;Job Cuts at Xbox Gaming Division"><a target="_blank" href="http://Microsoft%20Plans%20Major%20Job%20Cuts%20at%20Xbox%20Gaming%20Division">Microsoft Plans Major&nbsp;Job Cuts at Xbox Gaming Division</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Bloomberg //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Microsoft has laid off thousands of developers over the past 18 months and it looks like the Xbox maker isn't finished yet. Bloomberg claims the company is preparing to cut more jobs in what it reports will be a "major" round of redundancies. Those layoffs are expected to be announced next week and would arrive less than two years after Microsoft spent almost $70 billion acquiring Activision Blizzard. How many salaries would that cover, you wonder?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/halo-studios-grants-blessing-for-fan-halo-survivors-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Halo Studios grants blessing for fan-made Halo "survivors" game</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="MindsEye Developer Build A Rocket Boy Begins Layoff Process Amid Disastrous Launch"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">MindsEye Developer Build A Rocket Boy Begins Layoff Process Amid Disastrous Launch</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via IGN // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Build A Rocket Boy, the studio behind universally panned sci-fi shooter MindsEye, is making layoffs just weeks after the title launched. The company confirmed the news to IGN, but stopped short of specifying how many people will be impacted by the cuts. It appears that over 100 employees could be made redundant, however, with the studio starting a 45-day consultation process that is triggered in the UK when over 100 roles are at risk.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xbox launches a branded Meta Quest 3S headset"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-launches-a-branded-meta-quest-3s-headset">Xbox launches a branded Meta Quest 3S headset</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft continued its recent habit of slapping an Xbox sticker on third-party hardware and calling it a video game console. This time, the company collaborated with Facebook-owner Meta to release the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. The limited edition bundle comes with a 128GB version of the headset, a Meta Quest Elite Steam, an Xbox controller, and three months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Microsoft seems to think the unique selling point here is the ability to stream compatible Xbox titles on a virtual screen that'll float around your living room like an audio-sensory blimp. Let's see what consumers reckon.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How co-op climbing hit Peak achieved 2 million sales for less than $200,000"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-co-op-climbing-hit-peak-achieved-2-million-sales-for-less-than-200-000-">How co-op climbing hit Peak achieved 2 million sales for less than $200,000</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">You've probably heard a lot of chatter about Peak, the comedic climber from Aggro Crab and Landfall, over the past week. That's because the title has surpassed 2 million sales in just nine days after being developed in around a month on a budget of under $200,000. That's a mean feat—but how was it accomplished? We'll give you a hint: it involved copious amounts of Korean barbecue.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The UK government announces £30 million Games Growth Package"><a target="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/685943ddb328f1ba50f3cf15/industrial_strategy_creative_industries_sector_plan.pdf">The UK government announces £30 million Games Growth Package</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via gov.uk // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The UK Government published its Creative Industries Sector Plan this week and ins doing so unveiled plans to roll out a new £30 million Games Growth Package over the next three years to "back the next generation of start-up games studios and talent." The government also intents to maintain a Video Game Expenditure Credit for developers in the country to ensure "stable, efficient, and competitive tax measures" are made available. The full plan is well worth a read if you're a developer in the country, but it's pretty dense so make yourself a cuppa first.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sony faces Dutch lawsuit over &quot;artificially high PlayStation prices&quot;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-faces-dutch-lawsuit-over-artificially-high-playstation-prices">Sony faces Dutch lawsuit over "artificially high PlayStation prices"</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via GamesIndustry // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Sony has been accused of exploiting its dominant market position in the Netherlands to artificially inflate the price of digital software on PlayStation. Dutch consumer group Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument has filed a collective lawsuit against the Japanese company and accused it of making consumers in the region pay 47 percent more for digital titles compared to physical releases—while also claiming people are being pushed towards digital consoles. The lawsuit is expected to result in a hearing that will take place later this year.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
