He did not share any details on the reason for the closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Burbank</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game we poured our hearts into," he wrote. "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show,' but it's more than that.

"That's what let's you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/godot-veteran-laments-ai-slop-highguard-s-mystery-financing-and-a-big-doc-for-big-hops-patch-notes-41" target="_self" data-discover="true">Godot veteran laments 'AI slop,' Highguard's mystery investor, and a big doc for Big Hops - Patch Notes #41</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The closure concludes a two-year run for Midsummer, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firaxis-vet-jake-solomon-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-life-sim-game">started operations in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the back of $6 million in funding raised by Transcend Fund in partnership with Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Midsummer's life sim game was an ambitious project">Midsummer's life sim game was an ambitious project</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked at the time about starting a new studio in the midst of massive waves of layoffs and studio closures, Solomon told Game Developer at the time that Midsummer was able to secure funding because of a desire to compete with EA's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the dominant life sim game. "Life sims have been very underserved," he said.

"The venture capital model is built upon significant return on the VC investment," he said. "When a VC funds our studio, they don't have any expectation of sharing in revenue, they don't set milestones, they don't dictate day to day operations, and they even pay the entirety of the agreed upon funding upfront, it's a great deal for developers."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But any company funded by VC knows the deal, you are expected to not just make a great game, but a transformational one." VC investors can only make money through an "exit event" like an acquisition or IPO. "Exit events for game studios are rare."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-sony-shutters-studio-bluepoint" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony shutters Bluepoint Games</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
