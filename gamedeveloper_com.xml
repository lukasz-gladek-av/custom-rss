The call to the CEOs mentions the "politically motivated assassination" of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, who was shot on September 10 while addressing an audience on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence," Comer said. "To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The letters, available alongside the press release, are addressed to Discord CEO Humam Sakhnini, Valve president Gabe Newell, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. The hearing will take place on Wednesday, October 8. Congress is asking the executives to provide a written testimony at least two business days prior to the hearing.
