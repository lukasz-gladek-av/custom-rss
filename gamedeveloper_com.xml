Pollock described that approach as more "typical," but feels the financing opportunities available to developers have become increasingly muddled over the past year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pollock said Aggro Crab didn't think securing funding for its next project would be "that much of a problem" given it had delivered the goods last time out, and explained the studio was "all guns blazing" when it came to pitching investors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aggro Crab had been seeking between $3 million to $4 million in funding this time around, which Pollock explained would have allowed the studio to really "swing for the fences" and pay its modest team (of around 12 full-time employees) a better wage. The response from prospective investors was lukewarm to say the least.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bloober-ceo-creating-a-safe-sustainable-workplace-takes-priority-in-studio-leadership" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bloober CEO: creating a 'safe,' sustainable workplace takes priority in studio leadership</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and time again, the studio was told it was asking for too much cash, leaving them at a creative and existential crossroads. "One of the biggest challenges of being a studio that works off project investment—which is many indie studios—is that the window is always shifting in terms of what people are willing to fund," explained Pollock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think it comes as a shock to some people to hear that there are budgets that are too low for some investors, as well as budgets that are too high. So, going into funding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we increased our budget for that reason. We said lets put more into marketing, lets do real localization, QA—the sort of stuff that a very scrappy indie wouldn't necessarily do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pollock described navigating around those perpetually shifting goalposts as "frustrating," but accepted it's simply the reality of doing business. Right now, he believes the overall funding pot available to developers is getting smaller, but suggests there are also fewer investors willing to bet big on "ambitious, higher-budget triple-I" projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, they want to ostensibly minimize risk by investing in multiple, smaller projects instead of taking a punt on a larger-scale prospect—even when it's being pitched by a developer that just hit a home run.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Aggro Crab believes smaller projects can also bring &quot;peace of mind&quot;">Aggro Crab believes smaller projects can also bring "peace of mind"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where does that leave successful teams like Aggro Crab? "What we're doing right now is looking to change strategy and work on smaller games for a while" said Pollock, noting the team believes projects that require around one-year in the development furnace are more viable in the current climate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a pivot that could also allow the studio to self-fund its work using earnings from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That said, Pollock remains confident Aggro Crab could secure funding for those smaller titles, but feels it's important to give his employees "peace of mind" by budgeting in such a way that projects won't "fall off a cliff" if the company fails to secure external investment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pollock explained having to downscale their ambitions in the wake of a critical and commercial success like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been a "morale hit," despite some of the upsides.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For me personally, as a creative, to have really put our all into something super ambitious and for it to have paid off so spectacularly is exhilarating. So a big part of me is like 'damn, I want to just run it back' and create these really ambitious projects with sweeping stories," he explained. "Financially for morale, there are really good things about having a multi-year project because you know where your money is coming from for years—but we were also working on prototyping our third project at the same time as seeking funding and hitting these dead ends. We felt caged by that too."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-microsoft-ea-and-others-unite-to-make-accessibility-messaging-a-priority" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo, Microsoft, EA and others unite to make accessibility messaging a priority</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, Pollock said it's also liberating to know that if a smaller project doesn't work out, it's not going to bankrupt the team. The issue with a longer three-year production cycle, he acknowledged, is that whatever you bring to market had "better sell." Even if, as Pollock conceded, it does "hurt a little" to perhaps place your magnum opus on hold, there's a sense that might be the safest way forward in an game industry that feels actively hostile to developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Creating this monumental piece of work comes second to forming a good team that helps people make a living doing cool work they enjoy," said Pollock. "So I do think we were forced to make the choice to [downsize our next project], but I also think it was the right choice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our spirits have been raised dramatically since making that decision. During the time we were spending working on this new larger project and jumping around from different funding talks, it was really wearing people down. Now, the new era of Aggro Crab is looking bright."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
