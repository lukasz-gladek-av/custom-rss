Why Unity? It’s incredibly versatile: you can create both 2D and 3D games for a variety of platforms, including PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. With a robust repository of assets and a large community, it offers extensive resources and support – an invaluable aspect when in-house resources are limited. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>User-friendly interface, extensive documentation, and strong community support</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are also among the huge advantages.

Many of those </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>with minimal coding experience</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also prefer this engine, as thanks to Blueprints, a visual scripting system, they can quickly create prototypes without having to be a coder with decades of experience.

It can do both 2D and 3D development and offers a node-based architecture, so it is quite intuitive for beginners.

For example, Blender offers comprehensive 3D modelling tools, including advanced sculpting and UV mapping, which Krita lacks. Krita excels with multiple brush types and stabilisers tailored for digital painting, which Blender doesn't offer.
