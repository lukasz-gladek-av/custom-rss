She also held key roles at 2K and Aspyr, serving as vice president of publishing operations and VP of publishing, respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midwest was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/midwest-games-established-by-ex-netflix-and-harebrained-schemes-staff">established by former Harebrained Schemes and Netflix veterans in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to help developers in the Midwest and other underrepresented U.S. regions find success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company has already published a range of titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tombwater</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Baboo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Duck Paradox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midwest has recruited Howard to spearhead its new shadow publishing initiative to provide "cost-effective, tailored services for hire to development teams." Discussing her new role, Howard said it's vital to provide developers with flexibility in an evolving game market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To succeed, games need to hit all facets of publishing throughout the entire development lifecycle, yet many studios lack the resources," she added. "While flexible models exist for development, that same flexibility has been missing in publishing—until recently. Midwest Games shadow publishing provides a scalable solution that integrates strategy and execution so studios can focus on making great games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midwest claims its new full-service model will address a "critical gap in the market" by offering scaled support, pricing, and service timelines while allowing developers to retain IP and revenue rights. Midwest says developers will also have "full say over publishing decisions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"More games entering the market and fewer traditional publishing deals available leaves studios with the daunting task of self-publishing. Midwest Games will offer both à la carte and full-service support on a work-for-hire basis, allowing developers to retain future revenue and IP rights," said Midwest in a statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Midwest Games shadow publishing offers services before, during, and after launch for PC and console games of all genres. The company touts its location as an advantage in pricing to keep publishing support accessible and allow more funds to go directly into each game. Services will cover the full needs of bringing a game to market, including Business &amp; Publishing Strategy, Platform Management, Marketing and PR, and Developer Services."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midwest CEO Ben Kvalo said the publisher wants to empower partners by sharing the right knowledge and resources, and felt it was imperative someone with Howard's experience was brought in to oversee new initiative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Midwest Games can help studios navigate a competitive and fragmented publishing landscape while retaining the value of their game and years of hard work for the long term," he added. "We're incredibly excited to bring Elizabeth's leadership in publishing and developer services to spearhead the initiative to support more games."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
