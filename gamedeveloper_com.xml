The decision comes after The Guardian repotted that an Israeli military group was using its tech to surveil civilians in Gaza. Now, after investigating the matter, Microsoft president Brad Smith said it has found evidence that supports "elements" of The Guardian's reporting and stated the company's review into the matter is ongoing.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-s-high-end-xbox-handheld-will-cost-999-in-the-united-states" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft's high-end Xbox handheld will cost $999 in the United States</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hideo Kojima partners with Niantic Spatial to turn the world into his canvas"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hideo-kojima-partners-with-niantic-spatial-to-turn-the-world-into-his-canvas">Hideo Kojima partners with Niantic Spatial to turn the world into his canvas</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">We're all about to become NPCs in Hideo Kojima's corporeal strand-like.

It's unclear what shape the project will actually take at this stage—a brief trailer shows a bloke wandering around a pretty sparse landscape looking for digital relics—but it's Kojima we're talking about so I guarantee it'll be weird.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo is opening its first-ever UK pop-up store in London&nbsp;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/September/Announcing-the-Nintendo-POP-UP-STORE-in-LONDON--2922380.html">Nintendo is opening its first-ever UK pop-up store in London&nbsp;</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Nintendo // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Choosing which Nintendo merch to haul back from Japan was a nightmare I became all too familiar with last year—and one I suspect many of you will have flirted with on your travels. If you're based in the UK, that nightmare is about to (briefly) end. Nintendo has announced plans to open its first-ever UK pop-up store in London from October 22 to November 16, 2025. Just like the company's emporiums in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, the pop-up will stock a range of exclusive merch that'll have you bellowing it's-a-mine!</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-retires" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser retires</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Krafton claims Unknown Worlds founders stole 'what essentially amounts to a blueprint for Subnautica'"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-claims-unknown-world-founders-stole-what-essentially-amounts-to-a-blueprint-for-subnautica-">Krafton claims Unknown Worlds founders stole 'what essentially amounts to a blueprint for Subnautica'</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This week, Krafton hurled out more court filings to restate its case in its high-profile legal battle against Unknown Worlds' former leadership team.

Last year, Unity CEO Matt Bromberg said killing the Runtime Fee was part of Unity's bid to become a "fundamentally different company" and regain the trust of developers.
