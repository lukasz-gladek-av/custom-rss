Somewhat coincidentally, Tencent had actually reached out to see whether we be interested in discussing how the company is attempting to create original franchises with global appeal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a compelling pitch. Tencent, after all, has acquired and invested in a litany of major studios such as Riot Games, Supercell, Frontier Developments, Paradox Interactive, Ubisoft, Epic Games, Remedy Entertainment, and more—but the company is evidently keen to start producing more widely recognized titles in-house.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's Tencent Games division, which shelters its publishing arm and internal studios, debuted a number of original projects at Gamescom itself including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Delta Force</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fate Trigger</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings: World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project Spectrum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Tencent hopes those titles and others will coalesce to create an original catalog that allows its internal teams to work on projects they're furiously passionate about while catering to different player communities around the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-need-to-pick-our-battles-the-chinese-room-boss-says-cost-conscious-development-holds-the-key-to-the-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to pick our battles:' The Chinese Room boss says cost-conscious development is the future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an approach that sounds solid on paper, but how is Tencent actively working to turn that vision into reality—and, perhaps more pertinently in the wake of Sony's lawsuit, ensure its original franchises actually innovate?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating&quot;derivative&quot; titles">Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating"derivative" titles</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Zhu, who oversees operations, strategy, and compliance across Tencent's global portfolio of studios, Tencent believes it is vital to match developers to projects they actually care about. "I think one of the things we look at a lot is, not just the IP itself, but more the talent within the studio," explains Zhu. "For us we ask 'what are they able to do and what are they passionate about?' One of the big things we look to do is make sure the studio and the scope and ambition of the project fits within he context of what [the team] is able to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Take studios like Sharkmob with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Exoborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's a relatively newly-formed studio, but they have launched a game previously and so for us the ambition is quite big. Also, we believe the market is there for the taking—and they are passionate about making first-person shooters."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Passion, of course, is probably the one resource that remains abundant within the game industry. In an era of studio closures, financing woes, and widespread layoffs, converting passion into a tangible products that can deliver sustainable returns remains a huge challenge. To minimize the inherent risk that comes with making video games in 2025, Zhu explains Tencent has adopted a data-driven approach that attempts to break down market trends and player expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/evil-empire-tells-devs-to-avoid-early-access-unless-their-project-is-90-percent-complete" target="_self" data-discover="true">Evil Empire tells devs to avoid early access unless their project is 90 percent complete</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We support [our teams] with data," he continues, explaining that Tencent pulls information from a "bunch of different places" including video game data platform Newzoo. "We consolidate all of that and then we internally have data scientists that work with us to do some predictive modelling to provide an understanding of where the market and trends are. We also have a group within Tencent that looks at game research. They are experts on games. They look at trends and what people are interested in. So, there's the game part, the data part, and then the audience part that we're building in as well—which is 'how do we engage with player bases earlier on to test an idea?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu says connecting with audiences prematurely, however, can be "dangerous." Especially when a studio is trying to create something new. It might be safe to bring players into the loop early if you're looking to make inroads into an established genre or market, but if a studio is eager to stray from the well-trodden path that feedback might become less valuable.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that note, we ask Zhu how Tencent distinguishes between inspiration and imitation? We acknowledge Tencent can't comment on Sony's ongoing lawsuit, but feel its important to understand how the company is working to marry its data-driven approach to franchise developments with its desire to create truly original titles that resonate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think most of the developers that we work with are confident in their abilities," says Zhu in response. "They are always looking to create something new and different. Their first thoughts are not 'what is derivative?' In fact, I think some of the research that we give them covers [...] features or UI that are a bit more technical or specific, versus IP itself. I don't think we, and a lot of the studios that I work with personally, have that ambition of 'we want to create a derivative IP from something else.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent believes mitigating risk is about &quot;matching the pitch to the market&quot;">Tencent believes mitigating risk is about "matching the pitch to the market"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking big swings also requires financial risk. Tencent evidently has plenty in the coffers, but Zhu explains the conglomerate is strict about moderating its investment level to ensure those risks feel sustainable. "When there are big challenges and unknowns on a project, we control our investment level. We answer all of the [pressing] questions first before going big," he continues, noting how Tencent works to garner a deep understanding of gameplay elements, narrative beats, and the potential for fun (which feels like the big one) before pulling the trigger.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu feels risk mitigation is also about "matching the pitch to the market." Certain genres, he explains, are always going to be more risky. "If you look at an open-world game, the investment into that before you even get to a minute of gameplay is going to be much bigger than if you were to look at a PvP shooter where you can quickly iterate," he adds. "The bar for investing into different types of games is going to be different, and the number of games we greenlight in certain genres versus others is going to be proportional to the risk level."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those projects that do make it through the production slalom at Tencent are expected to deliver. Zhu explains the ultimate goal is "evergreen" growth, and while that phrase will undoubtedly mean different things depending on the size and scale of individual titles, the company's aim is to cultivate franchises capable of matching its own long-term vision.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you talk about growth [...] I think our ultimate goal is evergreen, right? You look at League of Legends, you look at PUBG Mobile, you look at even Fortnite. These are long-sustaining products that are always in the ecosystem," he says. "That doesn't mean it will limit growth, though, because that creates opportunities to build out other things. Look at League of Legends and how its gone into Arcane and other genres. I think that's one example, and we're definitely look to do the same thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the projects that fail to reach those heights, Zhu claims any cancellation is the result of a thorough vetting process as opposed to knee-jerk reactions. "We take our time [when making those calls]. It's years. It depends on the game, depends on the team, and depends on the genre—but ultimately we give the teams the opportunity to go back out to the player base and test again, and repeatedly do that, to understand how we are course correcting towards that north star.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some ideas you know early on. You're like 'this doesn't make sense' and you probably have to kill that idea and move onto the next one. That doesn't mean that dev teams don't have a ton of other things in the pipeline. Other games, you do have to make tough decisions because, even with games in development, because you feel they'll maybe never reach the level of ambition that we have. But for the most part we greenlight games because we truly believe in those teams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
