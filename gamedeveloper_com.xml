The company attributes the latter to "better-than-expected performance" from third-party content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During an investor call, looking ahead at Q2, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said the company expects revenue to decline for Xbox content and services "in the low to mid-single digits."
