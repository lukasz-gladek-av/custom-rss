"We’ll look at each game, really look at the development that’s gone into the game, the breadth and depth of the gameplay, if you will, the durability over time and the repeatability of gameplay experiences.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-blizzard-veteran-and-overwatch-art-director-bill-petras-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Blizzard veteran and Overwatch art director Bill Petras has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Those are all factors, and there’s many more that go into consideration of what is the right price point for the game.

"I can’t speak for other games that might be released by other publishers or other platforms.
