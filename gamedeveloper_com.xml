Developers like Supermassive Games and GenVid technologies have put money where their mouth is, developing methods for players to make collaborative choices in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Quarry</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill Ascension</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24054911/silent-hill-ascension-its-trauma-mug-t-shirt/">your mileage may vary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on how effective these systems were).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any case, despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/amy-hennig-sees-a-social-future-for-storytelling-games">predictions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from leaders like Skydance co-president of new media Amy Hennig, collaborative choice-driven storytelling hasn't taken off. But just when that dream seemed dead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Digixart revealed a new trailer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">at the PlayStation State of Play in June. The sci-fi action adventure game comes with a fascinating narrative twist: not only do players make branching narrative choices that shape their journey, the consequences of those choices will filter out into the game sessions of other players via an online connection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system captures the payoff of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitch Plays Pok√©mon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-style collective input without frustrating players who wanted to go in another direction. Those choices will shape the next players' choices, which will shape the next players' choices, and so on and so forth. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-makes-ambrosia-sky-so-unique-game-developer-podcast-ep-52" target="_self" data-discover="true">What Makes Ambrosia Sky So Unique? - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 52</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game also features a "ghost" system where players get short glimpses of other players navigating the same environment, a system made popular by the Dark Souls series and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does it take to create a system like this? According to Digixart producer Kevin Bard and game director Adam Michel, the team only conceived of the idea because they made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and executing it is only possible thanks to a very methodical pre-production process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling">To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview, Bard and Michel stressed that Digixart's mission isn't just necessarily to experiment with narrative mechanics, it's to tell stories about themes directly tied to real-world conflicts. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was about escaping a totalitarian state, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides in Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is set in an oceanic post-apocalypse brought about by climate change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to do something about the climate crisis," said Michel. "That's what led to the weird setting of the game." He then explained that the seed of the multiplayer choice system was actually in a single-player system from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a procedurally-driven game where players run for the border multiple times. When players finished a run, they could leave unused money behind to benefit their next run.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was all single-player, but it sparked an idea which was 'what if it was not just yourself, but several different players following each other and playing one after the other, doing stuff for the next person?'" he said. (Michel did clarify he joined the team after many of these choices were made).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's where the pre-production process took over. The earliest version of this system was built in what Bard called a "prototext" (riffing on "prototype" in Unreal Engine). Digixart developers used this system to test choices and branching trees and how the consequences could filter to other game sessions, identifying what kind of choices were worth implementing, and others weren't.</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The prototext generated quantitative data how often asynchronous choices would trigger in another player's session, and the team asked players to assess if if their runs were "enjoyable" and "clearly understandable." The choices that ranked highest sailed into production, the ones that didn't sank to the bottom of the ocean.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said that Iterating on story choices, characters, and plot beats was "kind of the easiest" part. The trickiest part as production progressed was that players still to this day don't always understand how the asynchronous mechanics are impacting their games. "Some players never really understood. They were like 'okay, I see ghosts, I'm confused,'" he said, alluding to the "ghost" system showing brief snippets of of other players' game sessions."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump funding cuts 'devastate' video game research and development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Addressing that confusion required iterating on the UX design, like taking lessons from online role-playing games and having other players' names float over their heads when they appear in the game. "We're still iterating on that up until launch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another bit of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inspiration that's also helped Digixart communicate the system to players: end-of-level choice rundowns. These were first made popular with Telltale Games' choice-driven adventure games that let players see what percentage of players made the same choices (before the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/telltale-games-initiates-majority-studio-closure-">went under</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/revived-telltale-games-nets-8-million-to-bring-first-titles-to-market">revived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> those pages add in data about how other players' choices affected their run, and how their choices will impact other players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course there's also old-fashioned marketing. The pair were transparent that the first trailer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yVjNGNZcqHQ?si=l4x1735CTl_lX9am">Tides of Tomorrow</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> didn't lay out that there was a multiplayer system at work‚Äîthe ghosts look like they could appear in a single-player game too. The launch date trailer from June </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/43RMfZzY-M4?si=fqlbHU1nA-Ace64D">hammers that concept home</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The value of extensive pre-production">The value of extensive pre-production</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do game developers invest enough in pre-production? Depends who you ask. So much time has to go into the vertical slice or demo that goes in front of investors and publishers that by the time production is greenlit, it's questionable how much time the studio's had to plan out what the next few years of their life will look like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A good pre-production process for me is one where you don't have any remaining questions [afterward]," said Bard. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s pre-production was entirely focused on laying the groundwork for technical systems like first-person animation, boat physics, and online networking. It wasn't just a question of "does this work," it was also a question of "is this worth it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard explained that Digixart successfully prototyped a system where players could seamlessly travel from island to island without any in-game loading screens. "But then it was like‚Äîwhy the effort?", said Bard. They ditched that plan and went back to an fashioned loading screen. "That's way simpler and we can focus on what really matters."</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The unique selling point of the game is clearly the asynchronous system and the asynchronous story, so of course we simplified some stuff during the production to be 100% focused on that," added Michel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of this testing and iteration took place on one singular level, so that the team wouldn't rush into making too much content too fast that could be scrapped after production-led gameplay changes. Once the studio entered production, it immediately blocked out all the levels to act as a "skeleton" for the game. Now the team has a framework to anchor story elements‚Äîand asynchronous choices‚Äîaround.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Michel and Bard were transparent that even after all this work, some playtesters don't fully understand or even want to engage in the asynchronous choice system. They also face one untestable hurdle: what will happen when this system is dropped in front of millions of players shaping the flow of choices across different sessions? That question may mean experimental multiplayer system won't be "done" until after the game launches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said the best way to make sure the system works is to make sure the story on top of it is as compelling as possible."If you have a good story, if you have in the interesting characters [and] engaging stuff going on...no matter what crazy concept you have around it, they will still have a good time if the story is good."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
