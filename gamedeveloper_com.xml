This followed statements by then-CEO Jason Citron saying the company would "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-07/discord-to-offer-rewards-for-gamers-as-app-seeks-profit-in-2024">probably go public</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" in late 2024. With hundreds of millions of registered users, the platform has become central for developers' community management efforts—potentially making it a ripe opportunity for the investment world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Discord's central presence has made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/2025/03/07/discord-might-go-public-gamers-unhappy">many observers worry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that business changes benefitting Wall Street could worsen the app for users. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">Many</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have invoked the Cory Doctorow-coined phrase "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/enshittification">enshittification</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," which refers to the degradation of online products and platforms to drive short-term revenue gains at the cost of the user experience. Can Discord manage an IPO without alienating its core users—and the developers who follow them?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Possibly. At the 2025 Game Developers Conference we were able to get a surprisingly frank assessment of Discord's product strategy from chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy and senior vice president of product Peter Sellis, who were remarkably upbeat about its monetization strategy. The pair painted a picture that placed Discord Nitro at the center of its offerings—one that hopefully won't need "enshittification" to benefit all parties.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-was-really-wearing-people-down-the-funding-challenges-that-followed-runaway-success-another-crab-s-treasure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It was really wearing people down:' The funding challenges that followed 'runaway success' Another Crab's Treasure</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Discord's had plenty of swings and misses in the last half-decade">Discord's had plenty of swings and misses in the last half-decade</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Discord has enjoyed explosive growth in the last decade (particularly during COVID-19-driven lockdowns that left players at home and in search of remote socialization), it hasn't had a perfect track record. In 2021 the company tried to capitalize on its exploding userbase by creating "a digital third place" through "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/stages">stages,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" saying at the time that 80 percent of surveyed users across 2019-2020 said they use the app for non-video game purposes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then in 2024 the company retreated from that ambition, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-is-laying-off-170-employees-after-getting-too-big">laying off 170 employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter">telling users</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it was narrowing its focus from being a "community-focused chat app" to one where people "deepen their relationships through games and other interest." Translation: they couldn't break out of the video game bubble.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord doesn't want to call it a "retreat" of course. While quizzing Vishnevskiy and Sellis about what the company learned from its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retreat">withdrawal </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">from a difficult business strategy, a PR spokesperson interjected to say Discord views it as more of a "pivot."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bloober-ceo-creating-a-safe-sustainable-workplace-takes-priority-in-studio-leadership" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bloober CEO: creating a 'safe,' sustainable workplace takes priority in studio leadership</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After an awkward pause, Sellis chimed in with one major takeaway from the era: Discord's push to expand its userbase included investment in the Discord mobile app to better function on low-end devices. That effort proved successful in the long run as the company watched more of its video game-playing userbase adopt mobile as their primary platform of choice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you're able to do that, suddenly Discord gets better for gaming, planning the night with your friends, and then afterwards—sharing the emotions and things like that," he added. "I think what what you'll hear us talk about sometimes is that Discord is the best place to talk and hang out before, during, and after a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A happier and more engaged mobile audience drove what Sellis and Vishnevskiy said was the core of Discord's monetization strategy: Discord Nitro. The monthly subscription service—which offers users advanced server tools, customization options, and larger file uploads—is the center of the company's plans to monetize its free-to-play app.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was slightly surprising, as other chat apps and social platforms have preferred to prioritize advertising over subscription services. But the pair said all the other features the company has rolled out, like the Discord Shop, are downstream of Nitro subscriptions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sellis said there are three predictors for if Discord users will subscribe to Nitro: the time they spend in Discord, the time they spend in voice chat, and the number of their friends have Nitro subscriptions. And it turns out those with Nitro subscriptions are the ones spending money in the Discord shop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's a very strong indicator that we're incentive-compatible with our users," said Sellis. So if the shop isn't meant to monetize free users, what is? That would be the quest system—an unusual form of advertising that an audience of players responds to better than the broader public.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How will Discord monetize if it goes public?">How will Discord monetize if it goes public?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we follow those threads to a possible future, Discord's post-IPO revenue strategy will likely be based on a carrot-and-stick approach to get more users on Nitro. The carrot would be to beefing up Nitro's offerings—possibly with incentives offered by game developers. The stick would be to eroding the features available to free Discord users and lock them behind a Nitro paywall (the aforementioned enshittification).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Sellis' theory holds up, then the company's best path forward is to nudge users to spend more time in voice chat, and to connect them with users subscribed to Nitro. Discord sits at the center of the "online social" future—the phenomenon of players spending time in online games not to compete, but to casually socialize—and what direction it takes to drive revenue could shape the games that rely on it to host their communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
