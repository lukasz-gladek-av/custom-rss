If you've ever wondered what the game would be like if the soldiers were ducks instead of people, you're not alone. Team Soda, a development team of Chinese company Bilibili, released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Oct.16.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not a multiplayer game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, instead reimagining the "extraction shooter" genre as a "PvE" single-player game. It may be easy to write off the game as a joke or novelty: The juxtaposition of the cute ducklings against the backdrop of a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is hard to imagine working. But it has the hardcore survival elements for a surprisingly deep experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works because Team Soda isn't necessarily looking to fit the ducks into a realistic world, but building out its own brutal but silly environment. It works. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=617681009992795859">Escape from Duckov</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=617681009992795859">&nbsp;reached 500,000 players on Oct. 19</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then doubled that in days, bringing in more than a million players by Oct. 22, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=503965668093198676">Team Soda announced on Oct. 22</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. On Oct. 28, Team Soda announced it'd doubled its playerbase once again—now </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">two million players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dhs-will-continue-using-game-and-pop-culture-iconography-in-messaging" target="_self" data-discover="true">DHS will continue using game and pop culture iconography in messaging</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s all about that PvE vibe and accessibility for such a hardcore genre," Tongpeng Chen, Bilibili's head of global publishing, said. "Players choose the difficulty and experience they would like to have in the game, venture into the wild, gather resources, then return to base to level up, build stuff, and complete missions."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That satisfying loop of “loot, upgrade, repeat” gives steady positive feedback—way more relaxing than the stress of PVP shooters." It lets players truly lose themselves in the world of Duckov. Per Jeff’s words, players are 'living' in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tongpeng Chen told Game Developer that a team of four people make up developer Team Soda, led by producer Jeff Chen. Jeff Chen worked at Bilibili for seven years, and the rest of the team worked together previously on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Soda Crisis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snake Force</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We initially thought selling 300K copies would be decent, 500K would’ve been a dream," Tongpen Chen said. "The current number is absolutely mind-blowing and encouraging for our team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tongpeng Chen said there's some luck to the game's success, but that Jeff Chen's dedication to the genre means he's an expert—he's played more than 1,400 hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jeff noticed that in Tarkov, a lot of players really enjoy the PvE experience that is also the essence of [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov]</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—not just combat, but also the progression and exploration parts," Tongpeng Chen said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-is-ending-active-development-on-new-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Amazon is ending active development on New World</a></p><p>Image via Team Soda/bilibili.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Still, that PvE craving wasn’t really being met these days. So our dev team put themselves in the players' shoes and focused on what they truly wanted. What players value in the game shouldn't just be money or high-value collectibles. Sometimes, bringing back a very mundane, everyday item determines the success or failure of a quest or a key progression milestone. Even if a player fails an extraction and loses valuable gear, they still have the motivation to go in again."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/">300,000 concurrent players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Oct. 27, a number that was reached after steadily climbing for days. These Steam heights pushed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> past games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6, Apex: Legends, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which are mainstays on the top games chart on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game peaks at prime game-playing hours in countries like China, where the game was developed, and slips back down to around 40,000 players during standard United States daytime hours. It suggests that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s core audience—at least at this point—is international.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was announced by Team Soda, then a team of four, on Jan. 22. It debuted with a demo version of the game that ran for two weeks, starting a day later, on Jan. 23. It quickly hit with players, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1886176519715749917">and earned a spot as the top demo on the Steam platform during that time period</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
