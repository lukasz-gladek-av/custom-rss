Most of us anyway. The sun is setting on 2025 and I have to say each year of the game industry's ongoing economic contraction has found new fresh ways to torment us (and occasionally delight us. There was SOME good news this year!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimists and pessimists will have plenty to chew on with this year's most notable trends. The optimists in game development will see an industry in the midst of great change, finally beginning to move past the unrelenting layoffs and studio closures that dogged it since 2022. The old world is dying, the new world is being born, and birth is of course, a painful process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cynics may look at the last year and see a far different picture: one of exploitation. Of workers, of players—even of studio heads. The biggest winners of the year were indubitably those who could turn a buck off of the hard work of others: the rent-seekers, the CEOs, the do-nothing YouTubers...it was a banner year for profiting off the pain of others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which camp do I fall in? Ah, dear reader, consider that to understand both points of view I am forced to hold both of them in my head. Picture the sound of two sawblades grinding against each other and you'll understand what it feels like to process the complex state of the video game industry.

Not really. Some games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hidden Door</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> explored how LLMs can inform new styles of gameplay without burning tons of CO2 and slurping up unethically harvested data.

The sad truth is that it's as bad for what remains of professional game journalism, with several publications shuttering in the last few years, or seeing the injustice of their shambling remains trotted out by increasingly hollow media companies.
