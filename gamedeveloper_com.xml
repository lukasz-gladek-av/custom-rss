Epic is currently attempting to carry that momentum forward by turning </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into a haven for UGC creators.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to ride that wave and participate in the Fortnite Creator Economy, with Sweeney noting that 40 percent of playtime on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is currently spent in third-party experiences built by independent developers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sweeney said it's imperative that companies like Unity and Epic work together to build an "open metaverse" that's interoperable and fair. "Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how the partnership will impact developers, Sweeney said both companies hope to address challenges related to the fragmentation of tools and publishing pathways.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/dispatch-s-episodic-format-alongside-sharp-storytelling-is-key-to-its-success" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dispatch's episodic format - alongside sharp storytelling - is key to its success</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get the ball rolling, he confirmed Unity will bring its in-app purchase SDK to all Unreal Engine developers. "This means Unreal Engine devs, like Unity developers, will be able to choose Unity's in-app purchase APIs to handle cross-platform purchases, entitlements, pricing logic, and everything else," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/unity/status/1991074020758888511">he continued during the keynote</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is really valuable now.

"Crucially, these ventures are very different and not in competition with each other. To a large extent, therefore, Unity and Epic simply no longer see each other as competitors."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/lumines-arise-developer-enhance-is-forever-chasing-god" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lumines Arise developer Enhance is forever chasing God</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also indicated developers should view the partnership with a degree of trepidation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This announcement is being sold as a step forward for openness and interoperability, which sounds like a win for developers. In reality though, developers have benefitted hugely from the intense competition between Unity and Unreal Engine," continued Deane. "With that competition easing, the risk is that developers will find both companies more interested in pursuing grander ambitions than just offering the best game engine."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling companies under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
