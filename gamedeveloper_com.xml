For most developers, it would mean success beyond their wildest dreams. The stuff of fairytales. Delirium incarnate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Pocketpair, it's a heady metric that became reality—delivering fame, fortune, and (perhaps unexpectedly) some distinctly "bad vibes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing the pitfalls of overnight success at GDC 2025, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community manager John Buckley explains that becoming a household name in a heartbeat left the studio and its cohort of employees open to a barrage of abuse that forced the company to go dark.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Shortly after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was released it was super popular to hate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," says Buckley. "And it wasn't just your average Twitter user jumping in—it was basically everyone. It was people on Twitter. It was people on Discord. It was some big industry names, which I'm still a bit salty about. It was a lot of Linkedin circle-jerking. Hating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the popular thing to do at the time of release."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reason for that is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an impression-printing machine. You just opened Twitter and said 'Palworld' and it's half a million views."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley says people started spreading false stories about the project in a bid to piggyback off the game's success—and in some cases maliciously stir the pot.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/senua-s-saga-hellblade-ii-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II dominates BAFTA Games Awards 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He references the allegations that spread like wildfire on social media in the early days, when people began claiming that Pocketpair had leaned heavily on generative AI technology and even stolen character models from Pokemon developer Game Freak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latter, says Buckley, was the most serious by far— although he notes it was started by "some guy on Twitter" who has now deleted his posts after purportedly explaining he started the rumor because he didn't like the "animal cruelty" in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All of these accusations kind of swirled into this big social media and gamer movement, where you were either on one side [or the other] of this fake war that was happening," continues Buckley. "Because there was so much attention, that meant we were getting some very not nice comments and some very scary emails."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, Buckley throws up a slide that shows a number of death threats and violent messages that were sent to the studio—many of which targeted the artists working on the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is something that we really, really, really suffered with for a long time. This is why we went silent and why we stopped posting numbers and silly memes. We just went silent for like three or four months thinking this would die down. And it basically did."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/astro-bot-and-black-myth-wukong-take-the-lead-in-gdca-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Astro Bot and Black Myth: Wukong take the lead in GDCA 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley apologizes to attendees for showing those messages, but says it's important for people to see the "reality" of success in the video game industry.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I think a lot of companies might have crumbled under the threats&quot;">"I think a lot of companies might have crumbled under the threats"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after that ordeal, Nintendo helped keep the good times rolling by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-pocketpair-for-alleged-patent-infringement">filing a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over alleged patent infringement. Buckley describes the situation—which he cannot discuss in detail—as "not fun."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How did the team learn to cope with the onslaught of doom and gloom? "Slowly," says Buckley, before underlining how vital it is for developers to disconnect outside of work hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have your work time and you have your personal time. Basically make no comparisons between the two. So on a small level, we started setting timers and auto-muting apps. No Slack. No Discord. Things like that," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This was hard, especially for our players, because myself and one other person were previously the main go-tos when speaking with Pocketpair. After </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we had to shut down that communication flow because there was just so much coming in."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company also established internal channels to intentionally share positive feedback (from both players and industry peers) in a bid to boost morale and counter the cacophony of negativity. Employees were also told to avoid being overtly public facing to ensure they didn't unintentionally paint a target on their own back.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-art-of-balance-in-community-management" target="_self" data-discover="true">The art of balance in community management</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Social media is just the worst," says Buckley. "No one should use social media."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley acknowledges that building those walls means the studio perhaps doesn't feel as "personal" as it once did, but says the sheer volume of negativity that some workers were facing was throwing them off kilter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We really just tried to funnel the nice stuff [towards them]," he continues. "Funnel the fan art and kind of bring back some positive atmosphere into the company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite facing heavy criticism, Buckley says Pocketpair managed to retain all of its employees by fostering a tight-knit work culture and working diligently to protect its workforce. "I think a lot of companies might have crumbled under the threats, under the pressure, and under the negativity," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley reiterates the level of success experience by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn't all bad and says the title is still "chugging along" backed by an "amazing" community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other upside is clearly financial. The success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has enabled Pocketpair to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palworld-developer-pockerpair-has-established-a-dedicated-publishing-division">establish a publishing division</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to support other studios throughout the industry, and the company has also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pocketpair-forms-palworld-entertainment-with-sony-music-and-aniplex-to-expand-ip">formed a joint venture called Palworld Entertainment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with Aniplex and Sony Music to expand the reach of the IP.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley, however, clearly doesn't want GDC attendees to forget the human cost of that success.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
