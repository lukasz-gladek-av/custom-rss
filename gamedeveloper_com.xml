The company began developing Chroma in 2021 to enable its internal teams to better address the accessibility needs of players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft director of accessibility, David Tisserand, said Chroma has become a "highly efficient tool" after several years of internal use and development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It has allowed us to assess the accessibility of our games for color blind players much faster and more comprehensively than ever before," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua/ubisofts-colorblind-simulation-tool-chroma-now-available-for-public-use">added Tisserand in a blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we believe accessibility is a journey, not a race, we're thrilled to share Chroma with the entire industry.

"The team faced and overcame significant challenges while building it, but through close collaboration with accessibility experts and by refining the tool based on feedback, they created a solution that eliminated lag and inaccuracies, making accessibility testing efficient and smooth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind.

A shining beacon of indie ingenuity that proves the only thing you need to achieve global stardom as a lone developer is a singular vision and the willpower to execute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be a colossal misconception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher Playstack, communications director Wout van Halderen explains that when the company first tweeted about signing the project two years ago the post received a mere smattering of likes. In short: nobody cared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says the company still jokes internally about the narrative that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> essentially materialized out of thin air when the publisher spent months carefully constructing a "Wheel of Attention" to give the project the&nbsp;best chance of success. What appears like a sudden ascent to fame and fortune was actually the result of a painstakingly intentional marketing campaign that acknowledged the title's weaknesses and played to its strengths.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?">How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStack marketing director Liz Cheng-Moore recalls how finagling a marketing strategy for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was "tricky" because, although the title seems to click with players when they're able to go hands-on, the UI-heavy visuals and delicious joker-jostling gameplay doesn't lend itself to conventional trailers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/playstation-platformer-astro-bot-dominates-2025-bafta-game-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation platformer Astro Bot dominates 2025 BAFTA Games Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack initially tried cutting together a trailer focused on gameplay but found it lacking. When that didn't work, a voiceover was added that still didn't quite hit the mark. Next they dialed in on the jokers themselves. Even then, there was something amiss and visuals alone couldn't showcase the buzz of piecing together that perfect run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playstack realized it had to fail fast and pivot. "I think the next best thing to playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is watching someone else playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and seeing the genuine reactions that they're having to the gameplay," says van Halderen. "You see the enthusiasm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher placed streamers in its sights, but rather than blindly pitching to the biggest names in the biz, chose to start small and expand methodically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack was "super specific" in its initial approach. He saw overlap with other popular deck-building and "highly-mechanical" titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay The Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Auto Pets</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The next question, then, was who are the top streamers playing those specific games?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/want-to-know-the-best-way-to-gain-attention-on-steam-add-a-demo-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Want to know the best way to gain attention on Steam? Add a demo.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After compiling a finely-tuned outreach list, it was time to start pitching with the knowledge that, at the very least, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would likely pique their interest—and crucially, the interest of their viewers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would have loved it if Markiplier played our game—but I had no evidence that would be the case. He eventually did around a year later, which was amazing, but if you put all of your eggs into that one basket you're not going to get a lot of results," says van Halderen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But if you pitch to 300 smaller streamers you'll get the same kind of numbers and a lot more word of mouth. You get all those communities who are now saying 'oh, my favorite streamer played so I'm going to download it and now I want to chat with out players'—so we're building community at the same time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains that burgeoning community will likely be vocal on social media and other platforms like Discord or Youtube—and may even encourage other steamers they follow to play the game. It creates a seemingly organic groundswell of positivity that is actually the result of a laser-targeted marketing campaign.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Never underestimate the power of a vocal community">Never underestimate the power of a vocal community</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen says cultivating that digital word-of-mouth was a "hugely powerful tool," because it enabled the publisher to start pitching media on the project from a position of strength.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/-the-public-are-kinda-crazy-palworld-developer-pocketpair-underlines-the-human-cost-of-success" target="_self" data-discover="true">'The public are kinda crazy:' Palworld developer Pocketpair underlines the human cost of success</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once community members are talking about it, I can go to media outlets and say 'check out this game, look at the traction it's getting. I can show you that people are clicking on articles.' I'm very aware that media is not out there to sell my game. I get my coverage, you get your clicks. So we're both happy," continues van Halderen, who notes that data generation is also vital when courting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If people are hungry for more information [...] we can answer questions like 'how long are people playing? How many people are playing?' We would see that thousands of people were spending six to eight hours just on the demo, which is huge. So if I go to press and say 'hey, we got 100,000 downloads on the demo and look how much they played,' then the SEO gears start turning and they will start to think 'maybe there's something here. Maybe we'll do a guide and a few thousand people will click on that.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's at this stage the "Wheel of Attention" comes into focus. The media feeds into the influencers. The influencers feed the community. The community stokes more conversation. The marketing cycle begins to reach fever pitch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both van Halderen and Cheng-Moore say Playstack initially expected </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to reach a six figure sales milestone—and that wasn't a modest estimate. They were both convinced early on that Localthunk's passion project had the juice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, with over five million players and counting, it's fair to say those original estimates were wide of the mark. Their marketing plan, meanwhile, was bang on the money.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
