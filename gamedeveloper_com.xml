The Finnish studio shared the news in its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">fiscal report for the third quarter ended September 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (Q3).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company saw revenue increase by 128.6 percent to €17.9 million ($19.4 million) during Q3. Operating profit rose to €2.4 million ($2.6 million) over the same period, an upswing on the €5.5 million loss reported by Remedy this time last year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remedy CEO Tero Virtala noted that development costs have risen year-on-year, largely driven by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He stated that Remedy is making "steady progress" as it works to expand its game portfolio with the launch of multiplayer Control spin-off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and move into self-publishing with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/remedy-and-annapurna-enter-strategic-agreement-on-control-2-and-transmedia-push">backing of Annapurna Pictures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our games in development progressed as planned during the quarter. In August, we made a strategic partnership agreement with Annapurna Pictures, which ensures we can develop </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into a great game. It also allows us to move into self-publishing and expand our game franchises to other mediums such as television and film," said Virtala.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the end of the quarter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">had recouped most of its development and marketing expenses. After the end of the quarter, the second expansion of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lake House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was released on October 22 alongside the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, previously codename Condor, continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is in the "production readiness stage" and remains on track to enter full production in 2025. Virtala noted many of the sequel's critical features have already been implemented to mitigate risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested ahead of time. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> remains in full production and is making "steady progress."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing Remedy's partnership with Annapurna in more detail, Virtala said the deal secured 50 percent of the production budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Control 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It will also enable Annapurna to develop movies and television shows based on Alan Wake and Control.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for Remedy's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/remedy-enters-into-15-million-loan-agreement-with-tencent">recent loan agreement with Tencent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Virtala stated that move will strengthen the studio's position in the value chain and grant it more control over how its projects are commercialised. Looking ahead, Virtala said expanding the interconnected Control and Alan Wake franchises will be "key" to the studio's future.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
