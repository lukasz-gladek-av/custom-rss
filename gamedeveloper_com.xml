A few days after the allegations against Rockstar were made public, the studio told Bloomberg it had actually fired a bunch of unionized employees for "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum." A spokesperson for the IWGB union subsequently informed Game Developer its members had a statutory right in the UK to engage in private conversation with union organizers that supersedes any employment contract.&nbsp;It also said the fired workers hadn't discussed any Rockstar products or titles during those conversations.
