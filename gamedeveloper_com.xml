Then, especially since 2018, doing so with a deeper interest in games as an art form, particularly through an interest in folk games and, later on, metagaming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> came about when me and my friends (which we would later call "plunderludics working group") were meeting weekly to develop and explore our ideas of "plunderludics"—games (or anything else) made from preexisting games.

I was trying to create a digital version of a theater game/score I am really fascinated with. I think it's called Lane Work, from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/viewpointsbookpr0000boga">The Viewpoints Book</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where actors are restricted to only moving back and forth in their own lanes, at different speeds (and then allowed a single action and a single phrase). The couple of times I played or watched it had been really powerful, and so I thought that could be an interesting direction to make something out of preexisting games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, instead of having multiple games showing at the same time and inspired by this Increpare game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.increpare.com/2017/08/running_memories/">Running Memories</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I started playing around with crossfading them at different intervals. I was also very interested in modular synthesizers, so at this point I was changing the character’s moving speed (the controller analog input) based on knobs, as well as the rate the crossfading happened. The effect was really mesmerizing, and at this point I realized that I could try making the fade actually have something related to the actual movement rather than it being a thing that happened in time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I spent a good amount of time figuring out good ways to make this happen, and instead of having the position of the characters in the games themselves dictate the crossfading, I made an invisible map where an invisible character would walk around, and in doing so would crossfade the games that were being displayed. From there, it was mostly technical issues and finding "samples" and placing them in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(This is what it looks like on the inside. You are that square walking around a big map. The three closest games to you get crossfaded)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main tools I used for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were the multi console emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk">BizHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for playing, "sampling," and playing back video games from many sources (and which has a great API to do a lot of what we do). I also used Unity for compositing the games' visual output and the logic in which that happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest version makes use of our awesome toolset </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/plunderludics/unity-hawk/tree/main">UnityHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which allows us to very seamlessly integrate BizHawk within Unity. UnityHawk is extremely handy and replaced my early-on convoluted patchwork stack of Python scripts sending and receiving OSC messages from Unity and BizHawk. I also used the modular synthesizer emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV rack</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the prototyping phase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> weaves together many games from PSX and N64 into its exploration of memory, nostalgia, and movement in digital spaces. What challenges do you face in weaving these experiences from different consoles together into a single playable experience? How do you bring multiple games together, let alone ones from different systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the previous question answers this, but I can go into a bit more detail. Earlier on, I was using Unity to composite images from the BizHawk emulator using this library: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture">uWindowCapture</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This allowed me to capture different emulator windows running in the background into textures in Unity. Then, there was a Python script bridging Unity and BizHawk through this protocol called OSC. With that, I could send messages to and from Unity and to and from BizHawk’s LUA scripting toolset.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a huge mess, and starting it up was also very unstable. Gurn Group and our friend Dan over the next year put a lot of effort into simplifying all of this by creating UnityHawk, which allows us to basically communicate directly to BizHawk from Unity and not have all those extra layers of indirection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The multiple systems issue is solved by BizHawk, which is a godsend for us, allowing us to very seamlessly run games from a lot of different consoles. One friction point was that sometimes some games didn't take analog input, or the d-pad would affect the game differently, so I had to make sure each game had a correct input mapping so they all ran smoothly (if you look closely, you can see that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mega Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for some reason, only turns right. I never got that one).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Has mixing these games together resulted in any interesting unintended results? Created something useful that may have taken you by surprise?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am always really excited to see moments where players move beyond the places that I preselected for them. Sometimes this happened because I didn't know it was possible to get there without jumping, but most times it’s because they either die or hit a condition in which the game is expecting input other than moving (a cutscene or a dialogue). I think a lot of these moments create an exciting variation on the general infinite going forward of the game. I particularly love this one moment where you can get to a dialogue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Majora's Mask</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> saying that you have a stupid horse while in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you are stuck on a moving platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How does it feel to repurpose and reshape the works of others in such a way that they pull from their existing meanings while also creating whole new ones? What interests you about creating things in this way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the most exciting thing about "plundering," as we call it, is having a whole new view on playing any game. I notice how the characters move in all of them, how long it takes for the game to boot and actually get into gameplay, how long it takes to be free from a tutorial interrupting you, how the swimming animation looks, how there seem to be bridges pretty early on in every game, how some 3D games have animations when pushing against walls and some don't, the different colors of the grass, places in which you can't jump if your character is stuck (I call these jump prisons), and many many more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope that making playable things in this way will also make people imagine their own possibilities, and also make an intuitive understanding that games are what we make out of the tools we are given. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because you want a snapshot of all the tigers is in the same level of playing it to get to see the entire story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also appreciate the historical aspects of it. While I can't deny the nostalgia factor of this project, I think it's important to be able to look at old games and think of them as "good for their time," rather than simply good on their own. Video game development is not a linearly progressing form, and many, many interesting things have been lost for the sake of streamlining and maximizing engagement. A lot of these early games are really bad, but a lot of them also surprise me immensely (the semi tank movement in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, feels like something lost to the modern 3D platformer).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I think it's also interesting in new games, as in new rules and objectives, rather than new content. We, as game developers, love mashing our loved references together to create new work anyway—Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, roguelikes etc.. We recreate these ideas from scratch over and over, without much examination on what that process is actually giving us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Oops, I wrote a manifesto).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about creating an experience by connecting several other games together? Cross-fading them over one another and connecting them? How did crafting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in this way help enhance its themes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was interested in the different ways it felt to move in the different 3D games, in the ways in which sometimes it feels like you were moving in one game but in a different game's scenery, and also in the dream-like narrative that arises out of the crossfading. The crossfading being driven by the movement of the player allowed me to make the feeling of actually moving between games—of it feeling like certain laces led to other laces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I personally didn't have particular themes in mind as I was making it. I pretty much trusted the process and let the games guide some internal meaning that could arise out of the piece. I think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works pretty much as a conceptual plunderludics work—something to spark the possibility space of making games out of other games: "here's a very simple structure to combine together multiple games, in any amount. Now, imagine the possibilities of making it more intentional—of highly crafting the transitions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember once talking to Bennett Foddy about the dream of making a narrative/single player version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Multibowl</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a video game with its own arc/story that is made completely out of premade pieces from other games. I don't think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> achieves this, but I hope it makes people imagine it as well, and maybe even live tiny, uncurated narrative moments for themselves while roaming around. I'm hoping to bring a new version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to GDC that will have an ever grander set of games, and an even more intentional placement of things in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you include the games that you choose for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Why these specific titles?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a funny question. There's, again, not a lot of intention behind it, I wanted to have as many games as possible for the initial show where I was gonna display it, but I also didn't want to simply play games until the very first playable moment and then switch to the next game. This was, in a way, also a research project in 3D game movement. So, I was pretty much going down a list of games that sounded interesting, playing them for a bit, and "sampling" them in the meantime until I felt like moving on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sampling aspect itself is more interesting and curated. I had some samples beforehand that I was using for testing and stayed on the final project, like Link on top of a tree which I was using for this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://plunderludics.github.io/works/linked%20jumps.html">earlier experiment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, once I decided to not have the jump button in the games, I started looking for jump prisons, and created my own little game out of searching for save states (I like calling them samples): finding locations in which, if the character can't jump, you are stuck in a particular area. There's not many of those, but I am always excited when I find something like that. I particularly love the one in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you walk on the moving platform. That’s probably my favorite sample.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I also started sampling moments where characters were in similar states, like being on a bridge, or being in a green place, or swimming; things like that. I didn't end up using a lot of these since I didn't want the same game to repeat too much, but I hope to expand on the project with more things like this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh, and I have also been fascinated with Any Austin's youtube series Unremarkable and odd Places, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">sample from </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">Spyro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was taken straight from that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interested you about exploring movement and the possibilities in 3D space? What ideas went into crafting a play space that would get the player to think on it</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a great final question for me to segue into shamelessly using this moment to promote my own, more commercially viable, work. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a work within my plunderludics practice, it is also a research project for me—looking at a variety of 3D platformers and seeing what works and what doesn't, what might've been forgotten in the past, and how we got to the kind of games we have today. Myself and my friends are working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2888670/pondlife_discone_a_videogame/">pondlife: discone (a videogame)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (Wishlist pls) which is the best 3D platformer game of all time (As in, it's already the best. We are simply still working on it to make it even better). Since we are developing a lot of our movement system from the ground up and reinventing the wheel in many ways, it’s great to be able to travel back to the time when the wheel was being invented and see what people were doing back then!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am very interested in movement in games—the general embodying you can achieve with different controls, as well as the feeling of mastery and weirdness of exploring a new body. I also like playing games in ways they are not intended to be played (mostly trying to climb things that were not made to be climbed), so I also like playing these games in search of such structures—unintentionally designed challenges that work regardless, or in fact, work because of, the way these games work. It’s fascinating to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love seeing people take these challenges even further, like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">Mario 64</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A"> half A press challenge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, trying to beat </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU">Dark Souls 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU"> without walking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">playing 4 instances of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">Mega Man</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ"> at the same time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">randomized </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">Zelda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfTDu9lzgtFHVirg_tSbRsSG6g0zKSdz6">many more</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
