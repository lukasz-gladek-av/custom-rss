It will be whisked away on November 14, meaning you still have a couple of weeks to take it for a spin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show, Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo told Game Developer that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playerbase remains "healthy," which begs the question: why spend time and resources developing a new limited-time PvE game mode (aside from the obvious overlap with the recent Marvel Zombies animated series) when the core PvP experience remains in fine fettle?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Koo, the intention with Marvel Zombies—and PvE in general—is to offer players a respite from the intensity of competitive play. "With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being primarily a PvP game, we wanted a supplementing mode to relieve the pressure of having competition every single minute," says Koo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the development team wanted to build a PvE mode from the outset, but were happy to wait for the right opportunity. That chance arrived following a chat with the Marvel Animation team, who explained they'd been tasked with developing a Marvel Zombies series. After watching the show, Koo realized the premise of a world overrun with crimson eyed cannon fodder was the perfect fit for a PvE experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/crusader-kings-3-team-says-addressing-feedback-backlogs-is-like-playing-darts-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Crusader Kings 3 team says addressing feedback backlogs is like 'playing darts'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo explains Netease Games views Marvel Zombies as a mini-game that's designed to pack a solid punch without overshadowing the core PvP experience. It took around six months of work to wrangle the mode into reality. Initially, a small strike force was assembled to cobble together a graybox prototype that would help the team understand how many players it could support and the inner workings of PvE level design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the core PvP mode supports six players per team, but it was vital to understand whether that would translate to a PvE offering that includes kinetic hordes of enemies. Koo explains the next step was to figure out how AI foes would behave—and, as a result, which hero characters would be a good fit for PvE. The end result is a cooperative mode that supports up to four players and five heroes in Thor, Blade, Magic, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others&quot;">"Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A couple of those characters were included to overlap with the show. Others were intentional wild cards. "Some characters were chosen because it makes thematic sense, especially characters from the show because they have great new costumes that we can show. Others were just fan favorites like Jeff the Land Shark. He has no business being there but it's just funny to see what happens if you pit a shark against zombies," says Koo. "Then you've got The Punisher, who is like your regular military guy defending against zombies."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those characters were remixed with augmented skills and a new upgrade system to ensure they could effectively handle the huge crowds of undead that will be swarming players in Marvel Zombies. Koo says figuring out how those undead masses should attack players was also important in dictating the ebb and flow of the experience. In the end, the team landed on fast-moving mobs that can bamboozle players and incorporated hard-hitting bosses such as Namor and Scarlet Witch to bolster the challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo believes players will learn a lot about themselves and their peers based on how they behave when the walls start closing in—but notes the difficulty curve has been fine tuned to ensure Marvel Zombies remains an enjoyable sojourn as opposed to a stifling timesink.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-secrets-of-dead-cells-smart-constraints-unlocking-the-vault-3" target="_self" data-discover="true">The secrets of Dead Cells' smart constraints - Unlocking the Vault #3</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can play Marvel Zombies solo or even as a team, so I think this mode will show players who you really are outside of competition. Whether you're cooperative, whether you care about your other teammates, or whether you want to lone wolf it," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development team is also keen to observe player behavior, and Koo underlines the importance of ensuring all players—whether they're big spenders or those who put the 'free' in free-to-play—feel there is value in sticking around for the long haul. Ultimately, the belief is that Marvel Zombies will offer them another reason to sink their teeth into a title that Koo hopes will still be going strong in a decade.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you see a player who comes in—even if they don't pay—to enjoy themselves they provide competition for other players. Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others. It allows us to see where their interests are and how we can create content that caters to them," says Koo. "And because this is not a pay-to-win title all of our heroes are free, we're able to see that pure engagement. Even if nobody pays, it's pure engagement."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
