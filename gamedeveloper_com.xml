Now, around two weeks later, Tencent has quietly edited the Steam store page for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Light of Motiram</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to remove certain screenshots and promotional text.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Tencent previously described the title as taking place in a world "overrun by colossal machines" called "mechanimals."
