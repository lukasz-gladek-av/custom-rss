The statement makes a point in clarifying that the negotiations primarily concern the production and administration teams, and they do not concern "the technology team working on Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Said negotiations are scheduled to begin on October 30 and are expected to conclude toward the end of November. If materialized, RedLynx said, the proposal would result in the "reduction of maximum 60 positions" at the studio.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RedLynx is seeking to focus on 'small screens'">RedLynx is seeking to focus on 'small screens'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The statement follows by adding that, if implemented, the "proposed changes" would refocus RedLynx from a multiplatform setup to a "studio specialized in small screens." According to the statement, this would enable RedLynx to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources "to best leverage the studio's unique expertise." It also mentions the studio is leading development on two unannounced mobile projects.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/outerloop-games-lays-off-multiple-employees" target="_self" data-discover="true">Outerloop Games lays off multiple employees</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This proposal reflects difficult choices we may need to make, and it comes after careful consideration," Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula says in the statement.

Just last month, the company cut jobs primarily within its publishing team.
