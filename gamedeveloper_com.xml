Yep, Team Cherry's wildly-anticipated sequel broke the internet upon arrival by momentarily turning Steam into an inaccessible void. There were also reports of similar outages on the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store. The downtime was as fleeting as it was widespread, but perfectly encapsulates how Hollow Knight has outstripped its humble indie origins to become a true colossus.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Activision and Paramount announce live action Call of Duty film"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/call-of-duty-paramount-live-action-movie-coming-1236358976/">Activision and Paramount announce live action Call of Duty film</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Hollywood Reporter // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">GUNS. EXPLOSIONS. SOAP. All of those things will likely be thrust onto the big screen when Paramount and Activision Blizzard's newly-announced Call of Duty movie eventually lands in theaters. Video game movies are generating massive returns at the moment, so it's hardly surprising to see Microsoft look to turn one of its most lucrative franchises into a live-action sensation. Will it actually accomplish that goal? Who knows. Paramount boss David Ellison said the company hopes to take a few cues from other storming blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick. It's a good start, but the proof will be in the pudding.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-keywords-subsidiary-high-voltage-games-learned-making-an-original-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dragon Front Adventures shows 'support studios' can win big with original projects</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/devs-unite-to-raise-over-200-000-for-palestinians-in-need-through-new-charity-bundle">Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">A chorus of game developers have rallied together to launch a new charity bundle in a bid to raise $200,000 for Palestinians in need.

It has raised over $32,000 at the time of writing, but there's always room for more.

This week, Bloomberg reported that Crystal Dynamics—which had been co-developing the now-canceled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Perfect Dark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reboot alongside Xbox first-party studio The Initiative—was forced to make layoffs after the project was canned by Microsoft. Word on the street is that developers at both Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative were given a chance to salvage the title by seeking a new funding partner. Yet, despite talks initially progressing with a range of suitors including Grand Theft Auto owner Take-Two Interactive, disagreements regarding who would take ownership of the franchise seemingly created an impasse. The end result? More people out of work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Video game journalists, much like developers, have been subject to a debilitating deluge of layoffs of late. Since the turn of the year, those under the umbrella of media conglomerates like Valnet and Ziff Davis have been kicked to the curb in the wake of major acquisitions. The solution for many has been to shun corporate ownership entirely and kickstart independent publications. Enter Rogue, a new worker-owned outlet established by seven former Polygon staffers. The website was formed in partnership with Rascal and will dish out news, guides, interviews, and more. Some articles (including most news and guides) will be free, while other content will be locked behind a subscription. The upshot of that reader-supported model, according to the founding team, is that advertisements and sponsored articles will be consigned to history. How does that sound?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">More layoffs, this time at Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven. The company, which was established by former Blizzard president Mike Morhaime in 2020, has brought two internally-developed titles to market this year but has now chosen to downsize. Morhaime didn't explain why the company is making layoffs but indicated the company is "facing similar challenges" to others across the industry. He also confirmed Dreamhaven's publishing division will bear the brunt of the cuts.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'That was definitely tough, right?—CEO of MindsEye publisher IOI responds to disastrous launch"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">'That was definitely tough, right?—CEO of MindsEye publisher IOI responds to disastrous launch</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via IGN // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Hitman and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maker IO Interactive (IOI) appears to be rethinking its publishing ambitions after the disastrous launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MindsEye</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In case you missed the hubbub, IOI Partners—the publishing division of IOI—was responsible for bringing Build A Rocket Boy's critically panned open-world shooter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MindsEye,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to market. To say the project received a mixed reception would be an understatement. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MindsEye</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was littered with bugs and glitches at launch, resulting in players seeking refunds en masse, an onslaught of negative Steam reviews, and eventually layoffs at developer Build A Rocket Boy. During a recent interview with IGN, IOI CEO Hakan Abrak said the ordeal was so "tough" that the company is wondering whether third-party publishing is worth the effort. "IO Interactive will publish our own games internally," said Abrak "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."

The decision was reportedly criticized internally when it was communicated earlier this year. It also drew widespread condemnation from players. Yet, despite the backlash, Bellamy feels it's his job to ensure Jagex titles operate "as apolitically as possible" for the good of players. "Ultimately our games offer escapism to many hundreds of thousands of players every day. If that escapism opportunity is compromised, there's a very real risk to the business." I'm sure his latest remarks will go down a treat.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
