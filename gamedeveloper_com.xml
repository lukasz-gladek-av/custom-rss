The series has experimented with a wide range of tones in the survival horror genre, some emphasizing a sense of dread and vulnerability, while others lean into action-horror gameplay to empower players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upcoming</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.residentevil.com/requiem/en-us/">&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> adopts the tone of the former games and gives players options on &nbsp;perspective: they can play the game in first-person or third-person view.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Tokyo Game Show 2025, we spoke with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa about what went into making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">feel unique in both perspectives—and the value in the unexpected timing of the franchise's 30th anniversary.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Requiem"><span>Requiem</span> is a timely game for Resident Evil's 30th birthday</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kumazawa told Game Developer that Capcom didn't plan for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil. But he acknowledged that the date is "undeniably going to be on people's minds at the time the game comes out. Players will be thinking a lot about what they liked about the series."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though not timed for the 30th anniversary, the game certainly pulls from the franchise's vast library for its story. It moves away from the Ethan Winters saga of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RE7 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Village </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and into a new storyline focusing on Grace Ashcroft—daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Outbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It also revisits the horrors that took place in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Raccoon City.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cycling-through-the-open-world-design-of-wheel-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cycling through the open-world design of Wheel World</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> follows in the footsteps of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Village</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which employed first-person immersive horror after years of increasingly action-heavy third-person games. The first-person perspective immerses players in a foreboding atmosphere filled with harrowing encounters rather than gunplay-focused setpieces.</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But those aren't the only two Resident Evil games released in the last decade. Capcom also diversified the series' gameplay portfolio with action-heavy remakes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2, 3, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We see a couple of trends in the overall series: the first-person games focusing on player immersion and the third-person games emphasizing story and character development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The contrasts between the two styles provided valuable learnings for the dev team looking for the right balance of action and horror for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The game aims to be the best of both worlds, said Kumazawa and Nakanishi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would best describe </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as stoic, it focused on being a relatively serious take on survival horror in &nbsp;enclosed spaces, whereas </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Village </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">expanded on that, almost as a reaction to the previous game, and it was more action based like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RE4 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in terms of how much gunplay and shooting there was," said Nakanishi.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Those were great, but with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>[Requiem]</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we wanted to bounce back on the scale…there are moments of combat with weapons, but there's more of a focus on the tense exploration of enclosed spaces with enemy encounters that are more sparse but still very intense," the director continued.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Player cameras can define a horror game's tone">Player cameras can define a horror game's tone</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Camera controls and how developers think about perspective can be critical in defining the tone of a horror game. The series began with fixed third-person camera angles that fully directed the player perspective, then began opening it up with over-the-shoulder third-person angles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That perspective was drawn back in again with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s tight first-person view. Now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sees the developers taking the unusual step of offering both first-person and third-person perspectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This expands on a feature introduced in downloadable content for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Village</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that allowed players to switch to a third-person mode. This turned out to be a test run of sorts for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/read-up-on-new-guidance-for-implementing-accessibility-tags-in-storefronts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Read the ESA's new guidance for storefront accessibility tags</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Nakanishi, this feature was motivated by a desire to let fans better calibrate the kind of terror they experience and allow horror fans who couldn't handle the first-person gameplay of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RE7 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Village to</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> get into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were still people who thought it was just too scary to get into," said the game director. "They tried the game, and they couldn't get through it because they felt it was too tense and too stressful for them, and they didn't want to play it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trying both schemes in a demo at Tokyo Game Show, it was impressive how differently the two perspectives can make certain sequences appear. It felt like playing two unique versions of the game.</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is going for a balance between immersive horror and character-focused moments, both first and third-person views required distinct design decisions. These include emphasizing the lack of visibility and the enclosed nature of first-person, while also presenting unique character animations to emphasize Grace's mental state in third-person.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you're playing in third person, she actually is animated quite dramatically to show her terrified and panicked reaction, she'll actually stumble and fall. Her speed doesn't stop, but it looks like she's panicking more, and it aims to make you feel more panicked and concerned on her behalf," said the director.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's not included in the first-person version at all for the same scene, because it would be difficult to clearly convey that and wouldn't feel comfortable in first person," he said, contrasting this approach to the classic method of making "optional" third-person modes that are still anchored around first-person design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you imagine first-person as the base, and then imagine you switch to third person, there wouldn't be really any animations at all. You have to make sure that it feels natural in both perspectives, so that players don't feel they're missing something with one version versus the other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the release of</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Resident Evil Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers are building upon the foundations of the series' biggest risks for its blend of immersive and character-focused horror. They have also unexpectedly made a game that has got the creatives and fans thinking about the larger legacy for its 30 year anniversary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could also show that there's value in offering ways for players to tune their horror experience to attract players who may have been hesitant to take the plunge into Capcom's landmark series.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
