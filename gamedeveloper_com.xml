This includes Ian Wilkinson as CEO and Tim Bennison as COO.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time of publication, it seems neither of the leads have shared a formal announcement. Wilkinson’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-wilkinson-28658912?originalSubdomain=ca">LinkedIn profile</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, shows the following copy as his current title: "Former Radical Entertainment, &amp; Hothead Games CEO co-founds New Radical Games Inc." According to the experience tab on this profile, he’s seemingly been the CEO and president of New Radical Games since December 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wilkinson co-founded Radical Entertainment back in 1991. Then, he sold the company to Vivendi Games in 2006, and retired as CEO and president two years later. He then joined Hothead in 2009.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/kingdom-come-deliverance-director-steps-away-from-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Kingdom Come: Deliverance director steps away from game development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the other hand, Bennison worked with Wilkinson at Radical Entertainment as executive producer and VP technology, and joined Hothead as COO in 2020. His most recent tenure was serving as COO at Capcom Game Studio Vancouver.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Radical Entertainment made a name for itself with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Prototype series. After being part of Vivendi Games, the studio then operated under Activision, with some of the latest credits including ports of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prototype 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and acting as a support team for Bungie on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Hothead Games filed for bankruptcy in December 2024, culminating an 18-year-long run. Some notable works include the Deathspank and Penny Arcade Adventures series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/hothead-games-has-shut-down-after-almost-20-years">farewell post via LinkedIn at the time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Wilkinson said that Hothead had been working on a playable prototype for a triple-A project. The timing, however, didn’t line up as expected, as the studio was unable to secure contracts to develop mobile, PC, and console versions of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unfortunately, it took longer than we expected to secure contracts for these versions of the game," he wrote at the time. "They were both ready to close two weeks ago and then the mobile publisher pulled out due to a change in strategy. Two weeks later the console publisher also pulled out. At that point our only remaining option was bankruptcy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It remains to be seen what the new studio will be working on. According to the site’s meta description, the team specializes in "remastering classic games by enhancing visuals, audio, and gameplay to revive beloved titles for modern hardware." The services listed on the actual site are work for hire full game development, mobile and console, co-dev, porting, and remastering.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-shutting-down-ugc-dungeon-brawler-king-of-meat-after-six-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Amazon shutting down UGC dungeon brawler King of Meat after six months</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
