In September, he adopted a more conciliatory tone where he stated the company's goal isn't to "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1838973833014895088">push any specific agenda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">."

It would have been "the next mainline RPG for the franchise" and was scheduled to launch in October 2027.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current and former Ubisoft employees explained to Game File that the game would have been set in the mid-19th century American South, specifically during a period known as "Reconstruction" that followed the American Civil War.

Grant. The assassination of president Abraham Lincoln by the pro-Confederate actor John Wilkes Booth hung over these events, as Lincoln believed in a different post-war strategy that would have extracted more concessions from the South and denied former Confederates political power.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/blog/the-failure-of-reconstruction-and-its-consequences/">Many historians posit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the failures to defend Black Americans' civil liberties cemented over a century of racist inequality only partially alleviated by the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.
