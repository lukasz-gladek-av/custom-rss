As Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr put it, "there is catharsis to be found in the silly and absurd," and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> delivers that catharsis in spades. It's as equal a contendor as every other game of the year award nominee from 2024, no doubt about that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, plenty of small, cathartic games have been up for top end-of-year prizes for many years now—but few break past longer, more bombastic titles. You'll either see narrative behemoths like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sweep ceremonies, or watch developers get knocked out of the way as the ambitious design of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> barrel through the competition. To see the little blue-and-white bot tap-dancing past huge games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, while also skating by surprise 2024 hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (offering each of them a little kiss on the cheek as it passes), represents a break from the last decade's trend.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it a fluke? Luck? A consequence of split tickets derived from first-past-the-post voting systems? Maybe! Or maybe not? At the ceremony, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet told Game Developer there might be something bigger going on behind the wins, a "deeper message" that indicates game developers and players are ready to embrace "more compact" games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Fun doesn't have to come in a large size&quot;">"Fun doesn't have to come in a large size"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we flagged down Doucet, he'd already passed by several times, accepting the studio's awards for technical, animation, and design achievement, as well as 'family game of the year.' He said he wished more of the studio could have been present in Las Vegas for the show, since the wins are a huge collective achievement for Team Asobi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But give Doucet credit—he has frequently devoted time at award shows to praise not only his collaborators, but his peers in game development. At The Game Awards in December 2024, he thanked </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/">a certain developer in Kyoto</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for being such a huge inspiration and for "showing there's innovation and quality consistently" in platformers, acting as a huge inspiration for him and Asobi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've managed not to mention them, have you noticed?" he asked, eyes flickering across the crowd—possibly towards where Sony management was sitting. Risking heat for showing that kind of gratitude signals he's a leader aware of how the game industry is a shared ecosystem, even when companies are direct competitors.</span></p><p>Image via Team Asobi/Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Team Asobi/Sony Interactive Entertainment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That canniness was on display at DICE too. He noted that while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had already picked up many Game of the Year awards, the DICE award was one awarded by his peers in game development—an honor handed down with understanding of the kind of work it took to produce a bitesized video game bursting with joy. "It's important that we made a game that's quite compact, that is not trying to be too big," he said. "I recognize the fact that it means it's a deeper message than we thought we had sent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What message was that? "Fun doesn't have to come in a large size," he said. "It's not about volume. I think we believed [that] early on, and now after this, even more so."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's going to be a drive for us to keep things simple and really focus on quality over quantity."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Quality over quantity&quot; is a major struggle for the video game industry">"Quality over quantity" is a major struggle for the video game industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't take Doucet's words as some knock on the bigger-budget hits </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has soared past. Again, a director who goes out of his way to thank his direct competitors is someone making clear he doesn't view the business as a knock-down-drag-out brawl, and many of Sony's titanic games are honored in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as collectible pals with cute outfits players can encounter on their adventure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it certainly is a gentle nudge against the game industry's direction since the heyday of the 3D platformers that inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As Game Developer's resident Star Wars freak, the history of Star Wars games is a useful measuring stick here. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/tales-from-the-making-of-i-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-i-">took about a year-and-a-half</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to make. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-design-director-on-starting-production-in-covid-19-lockdown-and-still-finishing-in-record-time-i-dont-know-how-we-did-it/">took about three years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not counting the foundation it benefitted from in its predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi: Fallen Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> took </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says-swedish-pride-in-craftsmanship-was-key-to-development-progress">around four years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Each game is stuffed to the brim with content and technical work that required larger and larger teams—but how much of that work is being appreciated by players?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' huge budget made it all the more painful when it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/three-reasons-star-wars-outlaws-might-have-undersold">debuted to relatively soft sales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When large games made by large teams don't hit, that's a massive amount of money spent for little return.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn't at risk of falling into that trap. Former Gamesindustry.biz editor Christopher Dring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/moTOwv8ay9Q">reported in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that it was developed in around three years by a team of roughly 60 people. That makes its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">1.5 million copies sold in two months</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a very efficient return on investment for Sony. That's comparable to the reach of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-dragon-age-underperformance-justifies-decision-to-prioritize-highest-potential-opportunities-">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game made by a much larger team in development for seven to 10 years depending on how you measure it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(An obligatory aside—the oversized budgets and development cycles for big-budget games are rarely the responsibility of the people working on them, and these comparisons are not an assessment of quality. That's something I have to write now because even some game industry professionals are being unbelievably weird about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game that was well-received by the 1.5 million-plus players who did pick it up).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet has it right. The industry excitement for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a message with great meaning. The cynical and cash-minded will look at its wins and think they should pivot to cute 3D platformers that appeal to players of all-ages. The savvy and creative will see the same result and recognize there are a thousand great games you could make with the same budget and team size—and they just need those who control of the purse strings to make it happen.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
