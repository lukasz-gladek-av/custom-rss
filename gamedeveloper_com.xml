The CFO told investors that, at the time of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-has-completed-its-acquisition-of-bungie">studio acquisition</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2022, Sony was offering "a very independent environment" for Bungie, which was "one way of thinking."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, referencing last year's "structural reform," Tao noted independence is getting lighter, and the integration with PlayStation Studios is "proceeding" at the moment. "So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction [for Bungie] is to become part of PlayStation Studios," Tao said via an interpreter. For context, the structural reform could be related to Bungie's Creative Studios </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bungie-creative-leadership-team-integrated-into-playstation-studios-as-live-service-support-team">becoming fully integrated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with PlayStation Studios in October of last year, although Sony Interactive Entertainment also had a substantial </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-expectations-for-us-are-high-new-playstation-ceos-outline-their-vision-of-the-future">leadership shake-up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conversation started after an investor asked Sony to provide an update on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, after Bungie delayed it in June of this year </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bungie-delays-marathon-after-tumultuous-early-reception-and-discovery-of-plagiarized-assets">following a tumultuous early reception</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, both internally and externally. Tao responded that Sony expects the launch to happen "within the fiscal year," which ends on March 31, 2026. Yet, the CFO emphasized the timeframe isn't a commitment.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/duolingo-acquires-music-game-specialists-to-make-education-more-engaging-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Duolingo acquires music game specialists to make education 'more engaging'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"No official announcement has been given yet," Tao said.

When asked about the status as well as whether the company sees issues when it comes to improving its live service games, Tao said that games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2, MLB The Show, Gran Turismo 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Bungie's own </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Last year </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> [shut down], and this year </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was postponed, so somewhat negative news has been coming out," Tao said, referencing the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> 's shutdown last year, a mere two weeks after release. "But if we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/indie-publisher-firestoke-shutting-down-despite-being-on-path-towards-profitability-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Indie publisher Firestoke shutting down despite being on 'path towards profitability'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tao added that the live service ratio for Q1 was about 40 percent, while the full year is ranging probably between 20 to 30 percent. In terms of transformation, she said "it's not entirely going smoothly," but that there's been a change in the long-term perspective over the past five years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Of course, we recognize that there are still many issues, so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there’s less waste and it’s more smooth," Tao said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in June, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst insisted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-studios-boss-confident-marathon-won-t-repeat-the-mistakes-of-concord">won't make the same mistakes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and that the live service market remains a "great opportunity" for the company. This came months after Sony </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sony-cancels-two-live-service-projects-including-god-of-war-title">scrapped two more live service titles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in development at internal studios Bluepoint Games and Bend Studios, the latter seeing an undisclosed number of workers</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-making-layoffs-at-days-gone-developer-bend-studio">&nbsp;laid off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think that some really good work went into that title," Hulst said at the time. "Some really big efforts. But ultimately that title entered into a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. So we have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations—and to ensure that we are not going to make the same mistakes again."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-playstation-5-has-topped-80-million-lifetime-sales" target="_self" data-discover="true">The PlayStation 5 has topped 80 million lifetime sales</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
