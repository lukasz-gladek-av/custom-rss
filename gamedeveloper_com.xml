According to him, the impacted titles include 2016's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Unspoken, Edge of Nowhere, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Feral Rites, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and 2019's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stormland</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When he contacted Meta for an explanation, the customer support told him to "ask Insomniac."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At time of writing, the studio itself has not issued a public statement on the matter. In a reply, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3ljdx3d4eej2n">Tarason</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> believed the delistings happened "some time ago," but their being unavailable to purchase went generally unnoticed. "Others are so thoroughly vanished that not even pirate and torrent sites seem to have the rest anymore," he said. "That's kinda scary, considering that Insomniac are a high-profile triple-A studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before it was acquired by PlayStation and making Marvel games, Insomniac put Ratchet &amp; Clank aside to work on several original titles. The most recognizable were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fuse </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunset Overdrive, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">but the developer also made phone games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruit Fusion, Digit &amp; Dash</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) and metroidvanias (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Song of the Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Its handful of VR titles came out during this experimental phase, and it hasn't dabbled with the technology since, not even to port any of its more recent works to either PlayStation VR system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The four VR games were all published by Oculus Studios, which has previously teamed with other prominent non-VR developers like Turtle Rock Studios and Gunfire Games. It's also purchased Sanzaru Games and the late </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-shuts-down-quest-developer-ready-at-dawn">Ready at Dawn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, both of which previously worked on spinoffs for PlayStation franchises Ratchet &amp; Clank and God of War.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Insomniac's apparent silence on these games' disappearance also underlines the need for a widespread </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/video-game-history-foundation-digital-dev-library">preservation effort</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the medium. If studios are unable to speak on their games going away for whatever reason, the titles deserve to be archived at the very least.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

Since that news, he said the team looked at different ways to keep going after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reignbreaker's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">launch, but said "none of those projects will move us forward, leading us to make this difficult decision."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This marks the first set of layoffs for the month of March that we've observed.

He candidly stated getting the word out about the studio's last game was support in and of itself, and directed hiring managers to contact him for "amazing talent in a wide range of disciplines."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support," he concluded.
