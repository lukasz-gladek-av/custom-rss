Over 40 percent of people who purchased a PS5 during the quarter were new users, leading to a substantial increase in the number of monthly active users (MAUs).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Cumulative unit sales of PS5 from launch until the end of December are essentially the same level as the cumulative unit sales of PS4 for the same period of time since launch, even though PS5 had a higher price," explained Sony.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Furthermore, MAUs after the same amount of time has passed since launch have increased significantly by approximately 1.4 times. This shows that the user base for the PS platform has significantly expanded from the PS4 generation due to the PS5ʼs backward compatibility and our various user engagement initiatives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quarterly software sales increased to 95.9 million units from 89.7 million units over the same period. Despite that year-on-year upswing, sales of first-party titles actually declined to 11.6 million units from 16.2 million units in Q3.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said it intends to expand earnings from first-party software next year with the release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Yōtei</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PlayStation MAUs increased to record levels in December 2024">PlayStation MAUs increased to record levels in December 2024</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing its wider platform business, Sony said the segment is gathering momentum with PlayStation Plus revenue increasing by 20 percent year-on-year on a U.S. dollar basis. The number of MAUs across PlayStation platforms in December 2024 rose by 5 percent year-on-year to 129 million–the highest number in PlayStation history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall playtime also increased by 2 percent over the same period, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of the above resulted in sales within the Games &amp; Network Services segment (which houses Sony's video game business) rising by 16 percent year-on-year to 1.6 trillion yen ($10.4 billion). Operating income rose by 37 percent to 118 billion yen ($767.2 million) over the same period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a performance that has resulted in Sony upgrading its fiscal forecast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Taking into account the results of the quarter, we have revised upward our full-year forecast for sales by 3 percent to 4 trillion 610 billion yen and operating income by 7 percent to 380 billion yen compared with our previous forecast," added the company.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Adjusted EBIT increased by 17 percent YoY in Q3," reads the fiscal report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Adjusted EBIT margin improved to 21 percent, driven by strong execution across many of the key businesses.
