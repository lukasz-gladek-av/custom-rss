The concern, he suggests, is that as they inevitably expand on a bedrock of first-party titles it will become harder for third-party studios and indies to cross that divide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yoshida believes Sony delivered a &quot;healthier&quot; subscription model">Yoshida believes Sony delivered a "healthier" subscription model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing Xbox Game Pass and how Microsoft has evolved the platform by adding more first-party titles while also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-really-wants-you-to-know-day-one-releases-no-longer-standard-on-xbox-game-pass">regaining on its initial pledge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to bring every single Xbox Game Studio project to the service on day one, Yoshida said the company might have bitten off more than it could chew.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apple-has-its-first-ever-internal-studio-after-acquiring-sneaky-sasquatch-dev-rac7" target="_self" data-discover="true">Apple has its first-ever internal studio after acquiring Sneaky Sasquatch dev RAC7</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While acknowledging his own bias as a former PlayStation exec, Yoshida suggested Sony's take on the subscription model through PlayStation Plus—which has seen the company make major first-party titles available to subscribers, but only after a traditional premium release—was perhaps "healthier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I believe the way Sony approached [subscriptions] is healthier. You know, not to overpromise and to allow people to spend money to buy the new games," he added. "After a couple of years there won't be many people willing to buy those games at that initial price, so they'll be added to the subscription service and there'll be more people to try [those products] in time for the next game in the franchise to come out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although he feels Microsoft might have made an initial misstep with that 'day one' pledge, Yoshida said the company has excelled in other areas. He described Microsoft's approach to backwards compatibility—which saw the company make it possible for Xbox Series X | S owners to play thousands of original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One titles—as "smart and very well planned."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They must have put a lot of engineering effort in to achieve what they have done," he continued.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-revives-flash-game-after-creator-finds-source-code-on-kid-s-laptop" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cult Flash game revived after programmer rescues source code from kid's laptop</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft wasn't the only company to receive plaudits during our chat. Yoshida also took time to praise Nintendo for slapping two controllers on the Switch and Switch 2 to enable multiplayer functionality straight out of the box. "[That's] so smart," he said. "It's in their DNA to cater to the needs of family and friends."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Yoshida, such as how he believes "stupid money" crippled the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-playstation-boss-says-stupid-money-crippled-the-game-industry">by clicking here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
