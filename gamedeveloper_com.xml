The team was able to attract strong talent (and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tencent-was-highguard-s-undisclosed-lead-financial-backer">secret Tencent backing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and set off to make a live-service game with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rust</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-style survival mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Partway through development, the team made a large pivot to the design that Highguard would eventually launch with. But testing was always limited to staff and some external testers (including from Tencent’s TiMi Studio Group). Leadership failed to see the wisdom in building community and soliciting feedback from the wider world of players, as the piece notes, management "wanted to recreate what had worked with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which had been kept secret until it was announced and launched at the same time."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/splash-damage-acquires-scum-developer-gamepires-from-jagex" target="_self" data-discover="true">Splash Damage acquires Scum developer Gamepires from Jagex</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was highlighted at The Game Awards in December, but Wildlight stayed secretive otherwise until launch on January 26.

It may be precisely the skill and development know-how (at least, know-how for a recent era) that led the team down this path.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The piece notes that several workers cited "hubris" as a reason for the situation, and the fact that more public testing could've helped hammer out some of the issues (at the expense of the secrecy that leadership so prized) is a sticking point. While early testing was reportedly mostly positive, the game was fairly complicated to get into, and players had an easier time when developers were on-hand to answer questions and offer guidance. They also reported a better time if communication flowed smoothly—a few key points that could have possibly been highlighted if larger scale public testing was in the cards.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
