"While the hypercasual segment in general has had a tough few years, Turkey has been a rare bright spot thanks to a growing cluster of studios which has helped to build up a lot of specialised hypercasual expertise in a market with relatively low labor costs," Omdia principal analyst Liam Deane told Game Developer.
