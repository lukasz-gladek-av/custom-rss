Publisher Kitfox Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/kitfoxgames.com/post/3lmugs3oe6m2t">shared the news on Bluesky</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and thanked players for their support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The brainchild of Bay 12 Games (the studio founded by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams), </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had been in development for over two decades before it finally debuted on Steam in December 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The procedurally generated fantasy adventure amassed a staunch cult following over the years in the guise of freeware, before Kitfox eventually partnered with Bay 12 to orchestrate a premium release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/kitfox-games-shenanigans/dwarf-fortress-2-months-later-648d1c4f34d2">postpartum and publishing retrospective</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> published by Kitfox in February 2023, the publisher revealed it had expected the title to sell around 160,000 units in two months. The game instead breezed past that milestone within 24 hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By the end of that two month launch window, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had sold precisely 606,342 copies—5,000 of which came from itch.io. Those sales earned Tarn and Zach Adams around $7 million, as opposed to the usual $15,000 they previously received each month via donations when the title was free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kitfox emphasized that success was the result of unique conditions that aren't easy to replicate. "Anything I say about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> probably will not apply to your game, for various reasons," explained the publisher in its breakdown. "See this more like a tour of a model home—interesting, possibly historically remarkable as a moment in time, and ultimately not meant to be a navigational aid."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-a-minecraft-movie-collects-80-million-and-remains-top-box-office-film" target="_self" data-discover="true">A Minecraft Movie has grossed $550 million globally in under two weeks</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher underlined that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had already achieved "legendary status" in some corners of the internet before arriving on Steam, giving it an immediate competitive edge. "Steam offers additional visibility and promotional opportunities to games that are already succeeding," it added, noting that its role as publisher wasn't to work on the title, bur rather to "maintain both trust and relative piece" between members of the Dwarf Fortress community while Bay 12 smoothed some wrinkles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The full launch breakdown, penned by Kitfox founder Tanya X.
