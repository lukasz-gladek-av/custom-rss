            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, Chicago-based, solo independent developer Shared Memory, headed up by Billy Basso, released its first game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Offering a combat-free approach to the exploration platformer genre (also known as a Metroidvania), Animal Well garnered a wealth of acclaim and praise for its highly stylized design ethos. Once the project was complete, its file size clocked in at a microscopic 33MB. Even compared to other independent games at this scale, shipping a game that takes up less than one-tenth of a gigabyte on a hard drive signifies a feat of technical wizardry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appropriately, Basso hosted a talk titled, “Developing at 5MB per Year: The Making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” at the Game Developers Conference this week. Focused on both the scratch coding he used to code the game and the discipline required to stick with a seven-year project, Basso spilled some of his secrets to making such an impressive—and small—game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, he broke down the tools he used for various parts of the game, saying, “I used Visual Studio for code. That actually covers a lot of development because you don’t really get a level editor when you’re not using Unity or Unreal, so there’s a lot of good data in the game that’s hard-coded in C++ files. I did make my own custom level editor that’s kinda built into the game that can be toggled on and off.” For the sprite and pixel art, he used the program Aseprite for the pixel art, mentioning that he modified the program itself on GitHub after coming up with a bespoke animation format. And for audio production, Basso used Reaper, another common choice for smaller developers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But here is where Basso began to deviate from his peers. Addressing the discipline and workflow side of managing a solo project like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for nearly a decade, he said, “For design and sort of task-tracking production stuff, I would just open up text files in Notepad on my desktop.” The crowd chuckled a little before he followed up, “I wouldn’t even name them or save them. I’d just type things in them and then when all the tasks were complete, I would close and then Windows would warn me ‘You might wanna save.’” This got even more shocked laughs from the packed convention hall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the development tools he used, Basso demonstrated the various modes of his homebrewed level editor. Using a tool that resembles Super Mario Maker’s level editor, he showed the palette of every sprite and tile in the game, adding “I could just pick one and sort of paint them around. [Designing levels] was just a matter of drawing these sprites and making the screens with all the basic kind of Photoshop-y tools.” Basso described a handful of Photoshop-inspired tools like the eye dropper and paint bucket. He even went into the Photoshop install files and extolled the application’s paint bucket icon because he liked that tool so much.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals" target="_self" data-discover="true">The technical magic behind Doctor Strange's portals in Marvel Rivals</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exactly 256 rooms in ">Exactly 256 rooms in <span>Animal Well</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He used these tools to fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world into a 16-by-16-room grid, making exactly 256 separate rooms. Basso said, “I couldn’t create any more because every room had a one-byte ID to it, so it only had 256 possible values.” That was a deliberate choice on his part to avoid any kind of scope creep where possible. Instead, he says he focused on getting the absolute most out of each of the rooms, adding, “I just focused on making every room as dense as possible. It was kind of a fun constraint.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received glowing praise thanks in no small part to its dense, efficient use of its detailed world map. Cramming the entire map into a one-byte system feels appropriate for a game that was hailed by players for its Swiss watch-like complexity and attention to detail.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-boss-says-the-streamer-must-seek-to-cause-disruption-<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We're in a fourth floor suite in the Metreon building opposite the Moscone in San Francisco. This is the location Netflix Games has chosen to outline its vision for its video game business, which has so far looked bereft of direction following </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-epic-games-exec-alain-tascan-is-the-new-president-of-netflix-games">leadership changes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-closes-its-only-aaa-game-studio">studio closures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The streamer has spent years scaling up in a bid to break into the industry, but according to Netflix Games president Alain Tascan—who's addressing journalists alongside VP of games and interactive experiences Jeet Shroff—the company "still has a lot of work to do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's a journey that we are coming into and we need to scale and build our gaming business," says Tascan. "We are not yet the Netflix of Games, but that's exactly where we're heading."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get there, Tascan feels the company must ruffle feathers. The former Epic exec, who replaced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-generative-ai-proponent-mike-verdu-has-departed">outbound Netflix exec Mike Verdu</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in July 2024, suggests the game industry has entered an era of stagnation and is crying out for change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been in the industry for a long time and we know there have been headwinds, unfortunately. Some of them are of course associated with cost [...] but what I see is also, over the last 10 years, we haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of format and gameplay," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-prioritizing-ai-workflows-enhanced-performance-and-expanded-platform-support-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity prioritizing AI workflows, enhanced performance, and expanded platform support in 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While nothing is guaranteed. If we continue doing the same stuff, there is a big chance we'll get the same result. With Netflix and games [we] have an opportunity to drive real disruption and real innovation with regards to how games are distributed, on what platforms, how we interact with them, and how we engage with the community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To that end, Tascan says the company wants to forge deep connections with players by creating "Only on Netflix" moments. The hope is that a few of those experiences will have debuted by the end of 2025, providing subscribers—all of whom can access the company's game roster at no extra cost—with a taste of what's to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We want to give people] new ways to play and new ways to experience stories, by trying to blur the lines between linear and interactive. We've been saying that for 30 years [in the game industry] for the old people in the room, but I feel that we are at that point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I say sometimes to the team we have a golden ticket, so what are we going to do with it? I feel like this is a place where we can experiment and do things that hopefully will make history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tascan believes success for Netflix would benefit the wider industry, helping to create a "blue sky in a place where there are dark clouds."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-m-worried-about-the-death-of-art-what-will-generative-ai-cost-us-in-the-end-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'I'm worried about the death of art:' What will generative AI cost us in the end?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a &quot;distraction&quot;">Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a "distraction"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how Netflix intends to execute on that vision, Shroff explains the company is taking some cues from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the wildly popular battle royale title is something of paradox, surrounding players with the familiar trappings of shooting mechanics and multiplayer action while simultaneously offering something distinctly 'new' by incorporating metaverse elements in the form of celebrity skins and evolving seasons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That juxtaposition is something Netflix Games hopes to replicate in its own way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You'll see us doing a lot of things that are perhaps a little bit familiar and recognizable, and then there is this idea of then pushing them into the unexpected and getting a little bit uncomfortable. We like to say we're uncomfortably excited," says Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The familiar might be a title that leans on a big recognizable properties like Squid Game or a deal that brings a huge franchise like Grand Theft Auto to Netflix Games. Both of those things have, of course, already materialized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those safer bets might then allow the company to take bigger swings in the form of new IP—such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the cooperative life sim </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year">unveiled by internal studio Spry Fox earlier today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-workers-in-the-us-and-canada-launch-industry-wide-union-to-fight-for-dignity-and-respect-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Game workers in the U.S. and Canada launch industry-wide union to fight for 'dignity and respect'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just want to be really intentional about where we choose to [use IP] and how we do that, and then with the unexpected I think the focus is going to be on innovation," continues Shroff. "We're here to really push the boundaries of what's possible. [...] We want to challenge what you think a game can be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shroff feels Netflix Games must display that sort of "bullishness" in order to move forward. Part of that drive will also see the company prioritize titles that can be played on the big screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The other focus area is what we're calling party games. We really want to reimagine what social engaging experiences can unfold in the living room," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company wants to explore that market by doubling down on the idea of smartphones as versatile and outlandish conduits of play—enabling Netflix's party game experiences to "spill out into the living room."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With [smartphones] you have a second screen, you have a gyroscope, you have a speaker. You have so many ways to interact—along with the fact that you have information that perhaps is only available to you—so as people are playing there's all this amazing social gameplay that can unfold," adds Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're really looking at pushing the boundaries of what party games—or couch play, as we call it—feels like."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The size and scale of the family market evidently isn't lost on Netflix. Tascan explains Netflix Games is also committed to becoming a "destination for kids," and believes that providing parents with a safe place filled with high-quality games will be a huge boon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains 15 percent of the Netflix subscriber base is already engaging with children's programming, and believes it would be foolish of the company not to think about how its game experiences might serve that audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's evident that Netflix doesn't intend to discount a single portion of its userbase. Tascan explains he wants Netflix Games to reach "hundreds of millions of people," and that means matching the wider ambition of Netflix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says anything less could run the risk of turning Netflix Games into an unwelcome "distraction."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
