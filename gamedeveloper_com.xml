His lack of games experience showed as studios reportedly spent months seeking his approval on various matters, from their next game project to whether or not they would appear at a trade event like E3.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Staff at WB Games Montreal and Monolith Productions expanded on those thoughts, telling Bloomberg they felt "stuck in limbo" while waiting for Haddad and his team to provide answers. Former WB Montreal head Martin Carrier acknowledged games "lost a little focus" as "a lot was going on politically" within WBD.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">JB Perrette, WB's games and streaming head, told Bloomberg the company would get "right back" to profitability as it looks for Haddad's successor.

The project was birthed after WB executives canceled an earlier project Monolith was making for over three years and several key staff—including studio head Kevin Stephens—left to start EA's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-opens-new-triple-a-studio-cliffhanger-games-to-develop-black-panther-project">Cliffhanger Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">WB Games Montreal was conscripted to make a live-service Batman game after Haddad first joined in 2016. That project eventually turned into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gotham Knights, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which the team hoped could be redeemed with a "1.5 version." That idea was rejected, and after failed pitches based on DC heroes Constantine and the Flash, WB Montreal was assigned as a support developer on Rocksteady's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suicide Squad</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
