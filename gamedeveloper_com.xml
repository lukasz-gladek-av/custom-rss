That's a takeaway many readers may get from today's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/OmKrKTwtukE?si=NZSrmpZy9X-xk2UJ">three-in-one announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of new Steam-branded </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hardware">hardware</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: the Steam Controller, the Steam Machine, and the Steam Frame. All three are optimized for Steam and SteamOS, but just like the Steam Deck, Valve promises that players can install whatever software they want on these devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller">Steam Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a standard gamepad with high-end features like built-in trackpads, haptics, and grip-enabled gyro controls. It also comes with what Valve is calling a "Steam Controller Puck" that magnetically charges the controller and quickly syncs it to any PC it connects to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a cube-shaped device running SteamOS that can pull double duty as a console or PC depending on the player's needs. It uses a "semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU" to deliver 4K resolution, and will possess either 512GB or 2TB of storage depending on which version the player purchases. It will have one USB-C input and four USB-A inputs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows Valve isn't backing away from the virtual reality market, even if competitors like Meta </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-meta-has-laid-off-over-100-reality-labs-employees">appear to be pulling back</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The device is a "lightweight and compact" headset with a Snapdragon 8 Series Processor and 16GB of RAM, and comes with two controllers. It can either stream VR gameplay from a PC via a USB wireless adapter or run games natively using Steam OS. Developers can request a development kit in their Steam Partner dashboard.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/valve-rolls-out-new-streamlined-steam-storefront-with-enhanced-search-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve rolls out new streamlined Steam storefront with enhanced search tools</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Valve is reviving dormant hardware dreams">Valve is reviving dormant hardware dreams</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't Valve's first bite at the hardware apple.
