He said 2K "injected a lot more resources" into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and acquired Irrational in 2006, which in turn freed up the studio to try enabling each team to have its own individual project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Irrational's Boston team would lead development on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its Australian side looked at making an FPS installment for XCOM, whose then-last installment released in 2001. Ed Orman, the project's lead designer, told PCGamer how turn-based was "a bit of a niche" back then as shooters were becoming popular, hence "having a crack at a first-person version of XCOM."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, first-person shooters can struggle with squad commands and partner AI, something Irrational itself ran into with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SWAT 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For mechanical inspiration and guidance, Gearbox's Brothers in Arms games were looked at, along with the 2004 shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum Warrior</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which Chey described as "was real-time, but it had a turn-based feel."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prototypes for the XCOM shooter took on various forms; the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum-</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">inspired one was deemed "too niche," according to internal feedback. Another pitch, which featured soldiers fighting alien kaiju and climbing atop them, was influenced by Call of Duty campaigns, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the movie Starship Troopers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both pitches, and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode where players would take on the roles of aliens they fought in the campaign, ultimately went nowhere. In trying to make the franchise into a shooter, Chey said Irrational "exposed the tension. It sounds great when you say, 'Let's do a first-person shooter XCOM.' But they're different worlds. So how do you bring them together?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The once and future XCOM">The once and future XCOM</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Irrational settled on its XCOM shooter being set in the 1950s. Per Chey, this "more horror-based approach" would include jump scares and discordant music, and using conventional military equipment to fight enemies "operating on another dimension."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chey would eventually leave Irrational in 2009 once progress on the project XCOM stalled. At the time, he felt he "had [not] made the sort of progress that I wanted to, or like I was contributing a lot and being the person who could make that project successful."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back, he said the studio should have committed more to its XCOM being XCOM. "People who loved [the series] wanted to see the same creatures from the tactical game in first-person," he explained to PCGamer. "[Mutoids and Sectoids] may not be the most original monster designs ever, but they're part of what people love."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Orman, who left Irrational months after the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JdVb4UnqO7A">E3 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveal, believes Irrational Australia being integrated into 2K Marin exacerbated issues with the project. Irrational's team members were now "basically separated" from their Boston coworkers, and they "could not work together with the 2K Marin team," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With both Chey and Orman gone, and the departures of other senior staff, Irrational's XCOM was dead in the spaceship. 2K Marin went on to reboot the project, which became 2013's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">a third-person shooter and Marin's last game before its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/layoffs-hit-2k-marin-remaining-workforce-to-be-reallocated-">closure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> later that year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Firaxis' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Enemy Unknown </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was a critical and commercial hit.
