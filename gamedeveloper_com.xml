He explained the company has been discussing the shortage from a "long-term perspective" with its business partners and doesn't expect any impact in the near-term. Beyond that, however, things look less certain.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ustwo-games-makes-layoffs-to-support-pc-first-pivot" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ustwo Games makes layoffs to facilitate 'PC-first' pivot</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability.

He also, however, noted that memory prices are currently increasing as a "pace that exceeds our expectations."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In general, the profitability of hardware tends to improve with economies of scale, and we want to continue to reduce costs as much as possible through mass production of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With regard to not selling hardware at a loss, what we are focusing on is profitability on a global basis. There are various external factors, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, but looking at the global picture, we have traditionally tried to avoid situations where individual units are sold at a loss as much as possible.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/blizzard-workers-ratify-union-contract-ghost-of-yotei-soars-and-has-yves-guillemot-outstayed-his-welcome-at-ubisoft-patch-notes-39" target="_self" data-discover="true">Blizzard workers ratify union contract, Ghost of Yotei soars, and has Yves Guillemot outstayed his welcome at Ubisoft? - Patch Notes #39</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends.
