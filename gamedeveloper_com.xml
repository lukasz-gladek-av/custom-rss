While there is a common, and understandable, stigma with live-service games and how they are managed, the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">were keen on building a more dynamic version of a Battlefield game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We talked about this consistently when it comes to building the experience for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I love live service, and I think it's the most fun to work on as a developer because of how you can build a game with your players," said McArthur. "We want to make sure right from launch that we start that sort of seasonal journey with our players, and the idea is to deliver ongoing, evolving experiences inside of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key points that the developers made about Battlefield 6 during the breakdown of its new features was that the upcoming game is all about "building a Battlefield universe." In addition to the plans for seasonal content post-launch, the developers are placing a keen focus on the evolving nature of Battlefield Portal and its various experiences to keep players invested in the game in the long term. According to Alma Talbot, the director of production, the toolset is so sophisticated that the community will be able to modify Battlefield into something unexpected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reaction we had in the room when we showed what players could do with Battlefield Portal was super galvanizing to hear. We love the idea of having this toolset that provides players the opportunity to create their own community experiences," said Talbot about the upgraded mode. "As a developer, it's cool to playtest the game all the time, and we're always kind of thinking about how great it will be when our players have their hands on these tools. But what's even cooler is when our players use our tools in a way that we don't even expect. So I know that Portal is going to blow us all away with what everybody's able to create out of those community experiences."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a better Battlefield">Building a better Battlefield</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is so far presenting an experience that aligns with the series' classic high points, while also allowing the developers sufficient room to grow and meet its more ambitious live-service plans. Another core lesson that the developers took from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 2042 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was to incorporate extensive player feedback, which they achieved through the private Battlefield Labs program, which gathered player feedback across closed tests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think one of the key things for me is the partnership with the community, which has been a critical success for Battlefield when it's working well," said McArthur. "That's why things like BF Labs have been another important aspect, which taught us moving forward, how do we make sure that we stick to those core concepts, but make sure that the journey we go on with our players keeps us honest in the vision and the direction that we have."</span></p><p>Image via Battlefield Studios/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, with the expectations for a more live-service-driven Battlefield game and the need to deliver on the true experience of the series, the developers stated that they indeed felt pressure to live up to what the series was about. However, the devs are feeling confident in this new vision of Battlefield, one that could end up being their planned future of a "Battlefield universe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think with a project of this scale, and with a franchise that's so iconic and beloved, we want to do right by our player base, so there is a lot of pressure that comes with that," said the director of production. "But I would say we're laser-focused on what we need to do, and I'm excited about what we have with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even what we have here today, what people will be able to experience in the upcoming open beta. It feels like a really exciting and energizing time, and I think even though the pressure is high, what we're going to be able to deliver is going to be something really solid that I know our fans are gonna love."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
