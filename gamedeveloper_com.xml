In fall of 2023, chief financial officer Amy Hood reportedly set a company-wide goal of 30 percent "accountability margins."

"However, profit accounting for individual divisions within a larger businesses is murky since it depends heavily on notional allocation of costs between the division and the rest of the company, so a notional 30% profit margin for Xbox should probably be thought of more as an internal accounting target. It would not necessarily be comparable to an independent company posting those numbers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're wondering why Hood and Microsoft leadership would make such demands, it simply may be that they don't see those margins as unusual for the rest of the company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/report-nintendo-to-produce-up-to-25-million-switch-2-units-by-march-2026" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Nintendo to produce up to 25 million Switch 2 units by March 2026</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Most of the markets that Microsoft is in are more profitable than games so the games business is always going to look sort of disappointing from the point of view of the Microsoft C-suite," Deane pointed out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer has reached out to Microsoft for comment on this story and will update it when the company responds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa Tech</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
