Intrepid news editor (and usual Patch Notes author) Chris Kerr is off at Gamescom Asia at the moment, so I'm just subbing in and trying to bring Chris' usual brand of good humor and cutting insight to the table.

United States Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren sent two letters this week to to U.S. treasury secretary and Committee of Foreign Investment chair Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew, expressing concern about "foreign influence and national security risks" in the deal.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="EA employees and UVW-CWA slam Saudi-led EA buyout, call for regulatory scrutiny"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-employees-and-cwa-slam-saudi-led-ea-buyout-call-for-regulatory-scrutiny">EA employees and UVW-CWA slam Saudi-led EA buyout, call for regulatory scrutiny</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Senators aren't the only parties concerned about last week's massive buyout news.

"EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="article-base-contributors"><div data-component="contributors"><p><a data-testid="contributor-name" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/chris-kerr" data-discover="true">Chris Kerr</a><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->Senior Editor, News</span><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->GameDeveloper.com</span></p><p data-testid="contributors-date">October 17, 2025</p></div><p><span data-component="icon" data-name="Clock"></span><span>3 Min<!-- --> <!-- -->Read</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Former Santa Monica Studio co-head and director of product development, Meghan Morgan Juinio, believes large studios and publishers need to diversify their product slate by financing more double-A, single-A, and indie titles in order to better cater to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom Asia, Morgan Juinio—who departed God of War maker Santa Monica in June after over a decade at the Sony-owned studio—explained the biggest players cannot keep putting all of their eggs in the increasingly expensive triple-A basket if there is any hope of breaking the ongoing cycle of layoffs, project cancellations, and studio closures that has become the new normal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think there's an opportunity right now for all of us, at any level, to really look at the strategic long-term view—and that might be five or ten years—[in order to course correct] because of the 'seize the moment' type decisions that came out of the pandemic," says Morgan Juinio. She explains that doesn't mean shelving major productions and believes there is still plenty of value (both creatively and financially) in greenlighting new entires in truly blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and God of War because the "payoff is potentially really large."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, she feels those companies with the deepest pockets need to be investing more in smaller titles. "I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right? And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there," she continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-hires-former-apex-legends-head-of-production-to-lead-31st-union" target="_self" data-discover="true">2K hires former Apex Legends head of production to lead 31st Union</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry&quot;">"I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Referring to recent releases such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Split Fiction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Morgan Juinio believes there is evidently an appetite and appreciation for titles that eschew big-budget conventions such as life-consuming playtimes and mammoth production cycles. Case in point: at GDC this year we learned that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">only in development for around three-and-a-half years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, she also believes players are drawn to those titles because they often showcase more innovation than their comparatively pricey counterparts. "What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she adds. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter hows pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteamworks-accused-of-retaliation-and-forced-crunch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Metroid Dread developer MercurySteamworks accused of retaliation and forced crunch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Morgan Juinio believes the industry will find a way through the current storm because anybody who chooses to spend their life making video games simply will not accept the current status quo. "I am an eternal glass-half-full type thinker and I think the doom-and-gloom may continue," says Morgan, who understands why the ongoing wave of mass layoffs and investments from questionable entities such as the Saudi-backed Public Investment Fund are raising alarm bells.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also, however, believes there is room for hope.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world," she says. "Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-employees-and-cwa-slam-saudi-led-ea-buyout-call-for-regulatory-scrutiny" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA employees and UVW-CWA slam Saudi-led EA buyout, call for regulatory scrutiny</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer is attending Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
