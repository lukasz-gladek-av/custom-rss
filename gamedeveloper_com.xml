According to Rogers, the company will implement "targeted cost initiatives" relating to underperforming business. Those initiatives could potentially result in more divestments. Game Developer has reached out to Embracer to clarify whether those plans could potentially include layoffs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embracer CEO believes AI will become an &quot;increasingly supportive force&quot;">Embracer CEO believes AI will become an "increasingly supportive force"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rogers claims Embracer is facing a "pivotal moment" and must double down on its biggest franchises. He explained the company has increased capital allocation to its core IPs, which include The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders, and Remnant.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He believes those franchises represent "one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry" but said Embracer must now "sharpen" its focus. The company currently has nine triple-A titles slated for release, excluding projects being financed by external partners.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/instinct3-launches-new-full-service-game-publishing-label" target="_self" data-discover="true">Instinct3 launches new full-service game publishing label</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years," said Rogers, discussing that release slate. "We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Embracer prepares to evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, Rogers said the company must significantly rewire its business to create a "powerhouse unit" within its PC and console division. According to Rogers, leveraging AI technologies will be &nbsp;integral part of that process.

"These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the table below shows, Embracer has already significantly reduced its workforce following a number of layoffs and key divestments.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-would-be-in-development-for-30-years-krafton-reiterates-that-unknown-worlds-founders-abandoned-subnautica-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We would be in development for 30 years:' Krafton reiterates that Unknown Worlds founders 'abandoned' Subnautica 2</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Its entire workforce totalled 7,228 people (including 5,452 game developers) as of June 2025.
