On the docket are stories about game writing, new hardware from Valve, investigations into the icing of The Game Awards Future Class, and much more.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Valve goes all-in on hardware with Steam Machine, Controller, and new VR device"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/valve-goes-all-in-on-hardware-with-steam-machine-controller-and-new-vr-device">Valve goes all-in on hardware with Steam Machine, Controller, and new VR device</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer//</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Valve's dreams for Steam Machines are alive, and couldn't have come at a better time (for Valve). This week the company unveiled a new hardware lineup with a console-like PC at the center, built around SteamOS. The pitch is surprisingly similar to where Microsoft wants to take Xbox—but Steam is the home of the massive PC gaming library, not windows. It's not going to topple Xbox (or any other console) overnight, but a polished multipurpose PC that easily works on your TV raises the question—what's the point of a console anyway?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstart-hit-with-legal-claims-by-iwgb-over-firing-of-unionizing-workers">Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The fired Rockstar workers aren't going down without a fight. This week the Independent Workers of Great Britain threw down the legal gauntlet in its battle with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maker Rockstar Games. This will be a fascinating fight to see play out because the UK has stronger labor laws than other regions like the United States. Will Rockstar simply take the hit, as no fee could dent its Grand Theft Auto-fueled coffers? Or will workers see their jobs restored?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-initiates-voluntary-resignation-program-after-record-high-quarterly-revenue" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton initiates voluntary resignation program after 'record high' quarterly revenue</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'We were effectively props’: young stars of game development feel let down by the ‘gaming Oscars'"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">'We were effectively props’: young stars of game development feel let down by the ‘gaming Oscars'</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via The Guardian// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Reporter Alyssa Mercante spoke with more former honorees of the Game Awards' Future Class program, following up on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">our reporting about the program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being put on ice (maybe forever).

It lasted 10 years. Oof. This is of course not the fault of the talented people who labored to bring the game across the finish line, but parent company Microsoft, which seems to change its strategy for Xbox and the Halo franchise on an almost-yearly basis. More Halo games—including the remake Halo: Campaign Evolved—are on the way, but will the company figure out how to supercharge the series that made Xbox a household name?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sony says Destiny 2 has underperformed since it acquired Bungie"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-says-destiny-2-has-underperformed-since-it-acquired-bungie">Sony says Destiny 2 has underperformed since it acquired Bungie</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer//</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Sony's post-acquisition struggles with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Bungie have now hit its balance sheet.
