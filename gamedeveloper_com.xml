In a statement sent to Game Developer, an Xbox spokesperson said the "workforce changes" were being made to "position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."

It was apparently granted an extended grace period after Santa Ragione appealed the decision—even though those appeals were ultimately denied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio has decided to make the title available free-to-download on the platform for the next 10 days to ensure as many people as possible can experience it before it is yanked from digital shelves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva said Apple has so far failed to provide an adequate explanation as to why the award-winning title has been marked for removal. "Despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification, Apple has not provided clear justification for this removal, citing only their policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated,' despite the game being fully functional and compliant with current technical standard," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products. Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-tried-to-choke-us-from-the-start-secret-6-madrid-workers-slam-owner-testronic-ahead-of-impending-closure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'They tried to choke us from the start:' Secret 6 Madrid workers slam owner Testronic ahead of impending closure</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form&quot;">"This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After his initial email appeal was quashed, Riva explained his second appeal resulted in a phone call with a member of Apple's team who instructed them to file another appeal via a different form. In that instance, Riva underlined that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheels of Aurelia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "continues to function properly and meets all expectations of users, including full compatibility with Game Center and the latest screen ratios."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also emphasized that certain video games and other creative works "do not inherently require continuous updates beyond ensuring functionality and compliance with current regulation and technological requirements."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Updating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheels of Aurelia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at this stage would demand very significant resources solely to refresh engine and SDK elements without providing meaningful enhancements to user experience or artistic value," he added in that second appeal, the contents of which were shared with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For smaller development teams, such forced updates represent a substantial financial burden, diverting limited resources from new projects or critical ongoing work. Alternatively, removing these titles from the App Store impacts developers' portfolios and visibility, ultimately affecting their sustainability and recognition in a very competitive industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva then received a message explaining that Santa Ragione's appeal was being evaluated. He claims it was rejected five minutes later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva feels Apple's approach to delisting titles it has deemed "outdated" leaves smaller developers at risk of needing to continuously update projects to meet vague demands, costing them time and money that might otherwise be spent supporting other projects or kickstarting new endeavours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, he says Apple's "dominant position in digital distribution makes those practices especially troubling" and reinforces the importance of diversified ecosystems. "We commend recent EU regulations designed to prevent monopolistic behaviors, fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether the situation will impact Santa Ragione's plans to support Apple platforms moving forward, Riva said the team was already discouraged by the company's shift away from human curation and questioned whether it is actually committed to helping game developers succeed.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ousted Unknown Worlds founders, former CEO sue Krafton for breach of contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This 'obsoletion' policy further reinforces a vision that does not recognize games as an art form," he added.
