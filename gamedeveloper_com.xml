And now they can," continued the CWA. "Workers will be sharing around a petition to address the industry-wide layoffs and hope to gain widespread support while at GDC."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-open-sources-3d-cube-model-in-first-launch-of-genai-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox open sources 3D Cube model in first launch of genAI tools</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Stand with your peers.

We make the games—we must set the terms," it added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, the union feels game industry workers too often have their passion exploited by corporations that constantly prioritize short-term profits over employee growth and treats its workforce like "replaceable cogs."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an FAQ, UVW-CWA said anybody working in the game industry in the U.S. and Canada can apply to join—including those plying their trade at triple-A, double-A, and indie studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Freelancers, contractors, and those in other roles at publishers, support studios, and more can also apply for membership.
