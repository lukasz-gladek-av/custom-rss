Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Nuovo award nominee</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a living digital museum and explorable discussion that takes the player through the developer’s thoughts on the current trajectory of tech and art.&nbsp;</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Nathalie Lawhead, the game's creator, to discuss what drew them to take their thoughts on social media and the restriction of tech and art and turn them into a game, the unique power that interaction has to make a subject really connect with someone, and how to weave even the game’s store page into part of the game’s exploration of its subject matter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm a solo-developer that makes experimental software and games. My work has been around, including one of my more popular games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everything is going to be OK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, making it into the permanent collection of MoMA in New York.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year I started lecturing for various events. One of the going themes in my public speaking has been the way social media privatized the internet, and how that has affected our own creative freedom on computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a long-standing concern for me because computers started out as such egalitarian things where (simply put) anyone could make a thing and share it, steadily shifting to today's tech-vision where we have all these walled gardens and private platforms that are actually fairly restrictive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The social media layer built over the internet, and the type of internet that we use the most now, has caused positive social change, sure, but I fear that the positive is widely being overshadowed by the empowerment of far-right radicalization and fascism. There's a lot of uncertainty about the future of tech (and the place any individual human has in it) under the shadow of AI and monopolies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My hope of turning some of these talking points into an interactive essay was that maybe it would reach a different crowd that usually doesn't care about reading long articles. It did, too! The conversations it started were interesting to follow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we challenge these things as artists, we encourage people to believe in a better vision of the future. Art is the greatest conduit to inspire social change. I believe the same to be true for games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we have these movements to "keep politics out of games" or attack marginalized voices to keep them out of games, or whatever... then you have to acknowledge the other side of the coin that there's something about games that can affect social change. Games are a type of art that is deeply meaningful in the digital landscape. I think, even if there is negative friction, that's where artists need to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started as a net-artist in the late 90's and eventually ended up in games because "game" became an umbrella term to encompass pretty much all interactive art on a computer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interactive essays—using games for the sake of critical theory or documentarian purposes—have been a thing for a long time. There have been these beautiful experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bagenzo.itch.io/madotsukis-closet">madotsuki's closet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a digital art piece about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yume Nikki</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://essaygames.itch.io/the-last-survey">The Last Survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that are more of a narrative essay. The intersection between essays and games based on personal experiences is strong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What fascinates me is how existing in a game can grow to encompass more than just fiction. You can use it to illustrate these impactful topics in a way that is deeply meaningful to players. The end result is much more personal to the person playing it than if they were to just read an article about what you have to say.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A while ago, someone pointed out the quote "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture" when I was talking about how making a game is an impactful way to talk about games, and I love that comparison. There's so much room for the medium to grow here. I think games criticism, critical theory, and essays being "playable" is an obvious thing to explore. It's certainly much more impactful to people when they are "in" the thing you are talking about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I used Unreal. The itch page jokingly boasts the features of: "Pedantic views on tech feudalism with nice shader work, and good reflection captures. Overly critical views on capitalism with lumen and nanite enabled."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted to use something that's usually associated with high fidelity AAA type of games, using all the latest offerings of the engine, because it's kind of punk to appropriate that type of AAA aesthetic for something completely counter to what that aesthetic represents. The mainstream has always appropriated queer, punk, and subculture aesthetics. It seemed like an interesting statement to do the opposite as a way to package criticism of capitalism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges and/or exciting possibilities came out of the idea of presenting your thoughts on this subject as a playable experience? What felt compelling about creating an essay players could inhabit and explore instead of one out of just words?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think you can reach more people if you package what you are saying in an intriguing way. Digital art is a huge possibility space. The internet is kind of divided into these groups of text, audio, or video, but computers can take that so much further. Games are the intersection of all these things, and there's space for exploring how essays could look in context of a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's interesting to point out that streamers and Youtubers have, in many ways, grown more popular than online text-based outlets. Youtubers often repackage these messages into their own videos, and people will rarely actually look into the writing being sourced. Video is just more intriguing of a delivery platform. That's a generalization, but I think it captures how people consume content online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that tangent, I wondered if a video game would be just as impactful. Would people be receptive to "playing" an essay about this? If it looked intriguing and high quality enough, would it draw people in?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be something you meander through while letting the environment illustrate the words. Links to different articles offer tangents, or rabbit holes, that you can fall into, all illustrating the points of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need more playable essays. It's a wonderful format!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into structuring the experience? Into creating the museum-like environment that guides the player through history and your thoughts while also allowing them the freedom to ignore the path and follow what they desire?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been steadily saving "free for the month" asset bundles from the Epic game store, where developers give away these expensive beautiful assets for free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm usually, and just on a personal artistic level, against using assets from others for my own work. There's a stigma to it that I'm paranoid about. I feel like that superstitious fear of what gamers will think is something that holds me back. I decided I wanted to just go completely into that direction of what's considered "taboo" to deliver a commentary on tech culture. It turned out interesting because there's this level of self-awareness and self-parody that kind of comes through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Things are paced out so that you are tasked with "collecting" parts of the essay, like it’s a museum tour, while stopping in front of these assets to look at them, or look at the links in the display windows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding that players will be players and some will just run through the whole thing, I kept in mind to build it so it can be silly and weird to do that too. You can actually escape the "museum" and walk off into the void if you wanted to. It ends up being a very strange relic of a world to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you shape the loud, colorful, chaotic varied, vibrant spaces the player would explore as they played the game? How did you choose the many, many varied visual elements in this game? Are there elements of the creative Wild West that was the early internet present in how you shaped this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be kind of like a museum so you have these throwbacks to old internet art and old desktop elements that all illustrate how vibrant our online culture used to be. Some of it is worked into the world to be almost unsettling... Like being stalked by the giant smiley face as you suddenly find yourself exploring the old Windows 3D Maze screensaver while listening to rants about AI and social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The results ended up feeling kind of haunted. I think it's because these familiar old elements are used so out-of-context—like you're exploring a lost past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What unique thoughts and challenges came from creating this work? From doing so using third party assets?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was really hard pacing the audio out in a way that players would get it all, within the order they're supposed to get it, while letting the player also feel free to go where they want.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've never used third party assets before to this extent. It was beautiful to be introduced to this generous space of asset creators that put out so much of their work that kind of ends up being melted into other people's games. Even if you work alone, game development is collaborative in nature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to highlight that work without it getting lost in the background.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The exaggerated use of third party assets plays a big part in giving the text a voice. Building this definitely made me more appreciative of asset creators, or these movements in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/c/2861178/plundercore-not-by-me-mostly">Plundercore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where games are made up of recognizable stolen pieces that are re-contextualized to become something else. Other media has so much of this, like sampling culture in music, or collaging for zine making.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an intentional decision to use other people's assets—these assets then being re-contextualized into something that is criticizing the current tech culture of AI... when one of the major criticisms of AI is that learning models are populated by "stolen work." It challenges my own discomfort surrounding ownership, fairness, and copyright. How am I different as an artist using these assets? Am I being a hypocrite, or am I being "subversive"?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also put a great deal of thought into the presentation, playfulness, and language of the game's itch.io store page (although you always put this kind of creativity into your store pages). What particular elements felt important to implement into the game's store page, and what drew you to draw from language about shovelware and visual fidelity/effects for your description of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The title is the best explanation. It's a chaotic bundle of everything that popular culture has tried to reject about games. It's an asset flip, which is a strong insult. It's shovelware, which players complain about. The word rant is crossed out because, for the sake of self-importance, it's a manifesto!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the self-awareness on the outset is a good commentary on itself. The fact that it so heavily criticizes capitalism, while being built in Unreal Engine, bragging about using all the latest bells and whistles, is also a wonderful self-criticism. It criticizes AI while also using re-contextualized work. The comment wheel is spinning, so is this even a serious work? It's weirdly between being really super critical while also mocking itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The current culture of technofeudalism, technocapitalism, mixed with a good dose of dead-internet... all these keywords... Present day is so darkly dystopian it comes around to being almost funny, in a morbid way. I kind of hope people get the subtle ridiculousness of it all.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
