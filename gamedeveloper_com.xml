            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image of Xbox controller via Microsoft </span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry is notoriously volatile. Companies hire up in the midst of development, when there's lots to do—character dialogue to write, bodies to animate, and systems to code. Then come the cuts: Once a video game is released, people are laid off. Not everyone, of course; enough workers are kept on to update and maintain the game, and, eventually, start on a new project. Development happens in cycles, and those cycles have consistently left developers on edge. Layoffs were a constant hum long before the pandemic, but over the past several years, that hum has become a deafening roar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">a crowd-sourced layoff tracker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from developer Farhan Noor recorded 8,500 layoffs. That number jumped to an unsettling 10,500 in 2023, and 14,600 in 2024. Now, in 2025, Noor's layoff tracker lists this year's layoffs at 4,000. While 2024 was almost certainly the peak of the grim years-long trend, layoffs are still an issue. Seven months into 2025, the 4,000 people estimated to have been laid off is likely a conservative number. (The tracker hasn't been updated since July 9, and several totals are unlisted, as those numbers haven't been released or published.) But to compare the years, by June 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">more than 10,000 people had been laid off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Mobile developer Sandsoft is laying off 21 internal developers to 'double down' on publishing</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, it still feels like layoffs are as constant and looming as ever. Hundreds of people were laid off in July across more than a dozen studios, led by massive cuts at Microsoft, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax">which laid off 9,000 tech workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including at least hundreds at its video game companies. Game Developer wrote about layoffs at four different studios on Tuesday alone. Support studio Virtuos, Wardogs developer Bulkhead, Myst maker Cyan Worlds, MindsEye creator Build a Rocket Boy, and many others are among the studios recently making cuts, while Riot Games recently canceled its long-gestating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> project from Hypixel Studios. Even if the numbers show slowing layoff rates, it certainly doesn't feel like it when multiple studios are cutting staff in a single day. The industry and its people will still be feeling the impacts of it for years to come.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off">What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amir Satvat, a Tencent business developer who runs an online community that helps laid off&nbsp;game workers find jobs, wrote in February that hiring has started to match the rate at which people are getting laid off.

"Long-term, global labor cost variances and AI may matter far more, with layoffs becoming a secondary concern."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This could have been avoided. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2020-light-version">The video game industry surged in 2020</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. People spent a lot of money on video games when they were stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Games were both a thing to do and a place for socialization. Investors saw that number going up—way up—and injected the industry with more cash. Companies hired more people to keep up with the growth. But the massive growth was never sustainable, and when that line plateaued, companies realized they'd overinvested and overextended. Companies started to make cuts—lots of them. The video game industry has returned to growth in 2025 following a plateau in 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/into-the-data-pc-console-gaming-report-2025">according to a Newzoo report from June</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Other reports suggest that at least one company, Microsoft-owned mobile behemoth King, could replace some laid off workers the very AI tools they helped build (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">thanks mobilegamer.biz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). We've seen all sorts of scenarios in which layoffs have occurred. Even huge successes don't guarantee that a company won’t see layoffs, which is precisely what happened in January </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/just-couldnt-dodge-that-big-boot-i-guess-no-matter-how-big-the-success-of-the-gig-marvel-rivals-developers-in-the-us-say-netease-just-laid-off-their-whole-team/">when NetEase laid off its U.S.-based team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched.

People are feeling the impact of inflation; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/23/trump-tariffs-inflation-back-to-school-shopping.html">everything is more expensive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It means consumers don't have as much money to spend on video games—especially young people, who are spending 25 percent less on video games, according to data analysis from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5">the Wall Street Journal</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's something that is sure to impact revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big change that sets 2025 apart from the past several years, though, is that hiring is beginning to match the rate at which people are being laid off. Headcounts are up across several studios (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">as Game File reported earlier this year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) despite several of those companies making layoffs. Hiring isn't typically publicized in the same way as layoffs, so it often happens in the background. Similarly, companies like Electronic Arts, when they make layoffs, might attempt to place laid off employees elsewhere in the business, which could account for at least some of the headcount differentials. North American workers appear to be impacted the most, perhaps because it’s one of the more expensive labor markets. Some of that growth in headcount could be a result of expansion in lower-cost areas.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered">Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though hiring has increased—and now remains stable—it would be foolish to believe it's easy for a laid off worker to find a job. It's not. The sheer number of people looking for work in the video game industry means there is now a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ton</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of competition. Nearly 40,000 people have been laid off, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">according to community trackers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That's a lot of people attempting to navigate the job market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to acknowledge the impact layoffs have on developers and the projects they're working on. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/709144/microsoft-layoffs-2025-ai-notepad">As The Verge reported in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the layoffs at Microsoft are creating a culture of fear at the company. That fear is reflected in the wider tech industry, which laid off tens of thousands of workers in July alone. In fact, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91369841/tech-layoffs-july-2025-microsoft-intel-indeed-scale-ai-full-list">a layoff tracker cited by Fast Company</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> estimates there have been 80,000 layoffs within the tech industry in 2025 (so far). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2024/10/research-the-long-term-costs-of-layoffs">Research from the Harvard Business Review</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, published in 2024, found significant drops in employee confidence following redundancies—and that low morale sticks around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These mass layoffs affect real people and real families and throw their lives into disarray," one ZeniMax worker </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">told Game Developer this week</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the wake of Microsoft's latest round of mass layoffs. "I wish for empathy, is the core of my messaging. I wish for people to be empathetic and think about the human cost when it comes to all of this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Michael Douse, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Larian Studios' publishing director, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1885033805636935709">wrote on X in January</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, studios that continue the brutal cost-cutting cycles also risk losing critical institutional knowledge. Video games are complicated, expensive endeavours. A successful studio is one that pulls the collective knowledge and experience of its team </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>through</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development cycles. If you lose that, you might lose the key to success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," ZeniMax Media senior QA tester and ZWU-CWA member Autumn Mitchell told Game Developer, explaining the difficult reality facing those developers left behind at The Elder Scrolls maker after Microsoft kicked some employees with decades of knowledge to the curb. "I don't really know [how that works]. It looks like a lot of people moving between projects to fill in the position of someone who was laid off—and it probably took them a good six months to figure out [how to do that role effectively]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One company that’s often cited as an example of what happens when you keep teams together and resist sweeping layoffs is Nintendo. Indeed, newly-published data reflects Nintendo's ability to keep employees on board. Just yesterday, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Game Developer printed numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from a newly-updated investor relations page that showed Nintendo Japan employees stay at the company for an average of 14.4 years. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs">Japan has more labor protections for employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which certainly plays a part in why employees stick around, too. The turnover rate is a stunning 1.9 percent in Japan and 5.1 percent at Nintendo of America. You can see the way Nintendo builds upon its past in its games; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a perfect example of how institutional knowledge leads to massive success. That game could not have been made without the learnings of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and, before that, what developers had learned from their time working together on systems.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's nothing about a culture of fear of being laid off that’s going to be good for people making games and the games they're making. Stability, and ethical wages, are the future of the industry.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done]]></content:encoded>
