Layoffs, conglomeration, generative AI, studio closures, and project cancellations once again swallowed the news cycle whole.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The word 'sustainability' still feels like a fever dream that might never be realized, despite the efforts of rank-and-file developers, who this year continued to push for better working conditions by way of unionisation (more on that in our upcoming trends piece).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video games, as always, were splendid. I can't recall not ever having cause for optimism on that front. Nevertheless, our coverage paints a picture of an industry that is still struggling to figure out how to help the people making those games realize their grandest vision yet: an industry that doesn't feel actively hostile to the very people it relies on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here are the biggest stories from another tumultuous year.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner agree to EA buyout"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-is-taking-ea-private-alongside-other-investors">Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner agree to EA buyout</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In what might be most notable story of the year, a investor consortium that includes a firm co-founded by Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kusher and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, agreed to acquire EA in a take-private worth $55 billion. The deal raised eyebrows because of Saudi Arabia's rather alarming human rights record and the fact the move will saddle the Battlefield publisher with a hefty amount of debt. If approved by regulators, the transaction will represent the largest all-cash sponsor take-private in history.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/id-software-workers-form-wall-to-wall-union-in-response-to-mass-xbox-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">id Software workers form wall-to-wall union in response to mass Xbox layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft spins off major franchises with backing from Tencent&nbsp;"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-confirms-1-16-billion-tencent-investment-in-new-subsidiary-is-imminent-">Ubisoft spins off major franchises with backing from Tencent&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After months of speculation, Ubisoft finally secured some of that sweet, sweet Tencent moolah by establishing a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios with financing from the Chinese conglomerate. Tencent invested €1.16 billion into the nascent division, which will house key franchises like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft said Vantage will be formed of "autonomous, efficient, focused and accountable" creative houses, each with their own leadership, vision, and strategic roadmap.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="GTA VI delayed (and then delayed again)"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-boss-says-gta-vi-delay-is-a-result-of-rockstar-pushing-hard-to-seek-perfection-">GTA VI delayed (and then delayed again)</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Presumably, the head honchos at Take-Two and Rockstar understand that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can only remain the most-anticipated video game in history if it never actually comes out.

The cuts impacted key studios such as King, Rare, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, and seemingly led to the cancellation of both internal projects and third-party titles being developed with support from the company's publishing division. The redundancies marked the fourth major round of layoffs since Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion in 2023. The full extent of the cuts remains unclear.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/disney-buys-into-openai-another-studio-escapes-embracer-and-the-game-awards-trailers-cost-how-much-patch-notes-34" target="_self" data-discover="true">Disney buys into OpenAI, another studio escapes Embracer, and The Game Awards trailers cost how much? - Patch Notes #34</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microsoft admits its tech was being used to surveil civilians in Palestine"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-has-ceased-and-disabled-services-to-the-israeli-ministry-of-defense">Microsoft admits its tech was being used to surveil civilians in Palestine</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following mounting pressure from journalists, employees, and protestors, Microsoft finally conducted a review into how its tech was being used by a unit within the Israeli military and subsequently disabled certain subscriptions to ensure its services couldn't be used for the "mass surveillance of civilians."</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">&nbsp;In a statement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Microsoft thanked </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">The Guardian</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for publishing an extensive report that surfaced those allegations, but made no mention of the BDS boycott or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime">open letter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from some developers within Xbox Game Studios that accused the company of being complicit in genocide.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rockstar accused of union busting by ousted GTA developers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-firing-over-30-union-members-in-calculated-attack-on-workers-">Rockstar accused of union busting by ousted GTA developers</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a story that will likely roll on into 2026, Rockstar was accused of illegally firing over 30 developers in the UK for engaging in trade union activity. The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) called the move one of the most "blatant and ruthless act[s] of union busting in the history of the games industry."

The Game Awards organizers have failed to directly address the elephant in the room as to whether Future Class has been officially canned, and instead stated they do not have any plans for the program "at this time." The lack of communication and clarity from show organizers has left some Future Class alumni wondering whether the program was simply a superficial way for the oft-criticized extravaganza to garner a bit of goodwill.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unknown Worlds co-founders duke it out with Krafton"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract">Unknown Worlds co-founders duke it out with Krafton</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where do we even start with this one?

It was a milestone moment that ended three years of negotiations and arrived after a high-profile strike designed to pressure companies, which, according to SAG-AFTRA, included 'alarming loopholes' in their AI proposals. In the end, 95 percent of participating union members voted in favor of the contract, with 5 percent opposed.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
