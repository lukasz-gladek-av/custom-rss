He's since worked as production director at Infinity Ward, chief operating officer at Vicarious Visions, and vice president of operations of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The new studio is a subsidiary of Embracer-owned operating group Embracer Freemode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ebejer will lead a team of 23 people, which includes industry veterans with experience working in the Guitar Hero series as well as emerging talent embedded in the rhythm game space. The special advisory board includes Charles and Kai Huang—the brothers founded RedOctane in 1999. RedOctane led production and publishing of the first handful of Guitar Hero games alongside developer Harmonix. After Activision acquired RedOctane in 2006, Harmonix went on to make the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, while Activision-owned Neversoft was assigned as developer for multiple future titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement says RedOctane Games is focused "solely on advancing the rhythm game genre," combining the past with the future.

Starting August 11, experiences that get the "Sensitive Issues" label will receive the descriptor on their details page and will be unavailable by default for users under the age of 13, although parents of older teens can choose to enable access if they wish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issues, according to the company, involve "current sensitive social, political, and religious" themes. As per the announcement, the descriptor is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue," and Roblox anticipates "very few experiences will receive this label."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Said experiences must also meet both the "polarized viewpoints" and "strong emotional response" criteria. The first involves whether the issue has a "limited number of strongly opposing viewpoints with little room for compromise or middle ground," while the second relates to whether or not the issue evokes strong reactions and/or "passionate debate" from players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-lauds-ai-powered-ad-platform-after-q2-results-exceed-expectations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity lauds AI-powered ad platform after Q2 results exceed expectations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, issues such as immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, prayer in schools, racial profiling, affirmative action, vaccination policies, and reproductive rights qualify as 'sensitive issues,'" reads the announcement. "Please note that this is not a comprehensive or finite list - any issue that meets the above criteria qualifies as a 'sensitive issue.' These issues are topics that are frequently in the news and inspire strong opinions and emotional debate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more specific example, the company said that an experience with a core gameplay loop focusing on immigration or border security would qualify, but one that simply includes references to countries and borders would not. Both experiences in this example would still be covered by Roblox's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">content maturity guidelines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox said that experiences that fall under the descriptor will not be suspended or removed from the platform, and instances where consequences would apply are for creators who repeatedly provide inaccurate information in the questionnaire.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'">'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it understands that identifying sensitive issues can be complex and varies greatly by region.

While the company recognizes that topics like social, political, and religious issues can be handled "in a way that is developmentally appropriate," it can't always guarantee the case due to the amount of user-generated content hosted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent times, some </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experiences have allowed people to attend virtual protests.
