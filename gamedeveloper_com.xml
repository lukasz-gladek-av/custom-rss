It was originally introduced in 2024, but it didn’t pass before the elections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The NO FAKES Act isn’t just about protecting actors, recording artists and broadcasters,” SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in the press conference. “Deepfakes can ruin all lives. It doesn’t matter if you’re a public figure or a high school student being exploited by internet creeps. It’s time to give humans the power to say NO, not my face, not my voice!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">National executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland explained that the bill would allow SAG-AFTRA members and workers who rely on their face and voice for their livelihood to demand that platforms “remove illegal voice and image clones.” It would also grant a legal path into seeking damages from “those who intentionally cause harm.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/actors-union-protests-outside-baftas-for-better-working-conditions-in-the-uk" target="_self" data-discover="true">Actors union protests outside BAFTAs to call for better working conditions in the UK</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“As innovation continues to rapidly evolve, it’s time for commonsense legislation that defends individual rights,” Crabtree-Ireland said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/BBD6E069-2ED5-473A-B81A-4815134B876F">main exceptions to the bill</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be a digital replica that is used in “bona fide commentary, criticism, scholarship, satire, or parody.” SAG-AFTRA mentioned that the NO FAKES act would preserve existing protections at the state level. This includes Tennessee’s landmark SAG-AFTRA-supported Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) act, alongside California’s SAG-AFTRA-sponsored AB2602. As such, NO FAKES would provide “one strong, consent-based framework for digital replica uses in expressive works nationwide.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A brief history of SAG-AFTRA's strike">A brief history of SAG-AFTRA's strike</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union is entering its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-urges-more-non-struck-game-studios-to-sign-interim-agreement">second year of striking studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> under the Interactive Media Bargaining agreement.

To the cheapest game. Because the people who are controlling the top corporations, that's all they give a shit about."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
