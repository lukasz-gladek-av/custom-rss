Naughty Dog editorial content manager Jonathon Dornbush wrote in the post that the studio "always wondered" what it would be like for players to experience the story in chronological order. He prefaced this by saying that the original structure—where players first play through the story as protagonist Ellie, then as new character Abby—is still "very intentional and core to how our studio wanted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s themes and narrative beats to impact players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios are prone to release post-launch updates and DLCs that expand on existing stories. A mode that deliberately reframes a non-linear narrative isn't as common. The closest comparable example would be how companies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Steel">Bethesda Softworks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/dlc/single-player/trespasser">BioWare</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have released downloadable content meant to expand the endings of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but these updates don't alter the pacing of the original game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developer believes that players will gain "even deeper insight" into the sequel's narrative, experiencing parallels between the protagonists Ellie and Abby, as well as how close they come into running into each other across their personal ventures through Seattle. Naughty Dog "of course" recommends players new to the game to play through the story "as was originally developed." The bulk of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> takes place across three days, which the player experiences through the perspective of both characters separately. There's also a myriad of flashbacks fleshing out their respective character arcs, the placement of certain scenes being quite deliberate and important in providing context.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-sees-the-classic-series-renewed-with-capcom-s-latest-technology" target="_self" data-discover="true">Onimusha: Way of the Sword sees the classic series renewed with Capcom's latest technology</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Naughty Dog teamed up with Nixxes to bring the Chronological mode to life.

The HBO adaptation's choice to lean on the game's non-linear structure to split its narrative across several seasons has drawn mixed reception. The season, which ran from April 13 to May 25, encompassed Ellie's perspective through the events in Seattle, while also hinting that season 3 will follow Abby's instead, which is how the game is originally structured. As reported by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://deadline.com/feature/the-last-of-us-differences-show-vs-game-1236372161/">Deadline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there are clear story differences, which are expected from an adaptation. For the most part, the show is also non-linear.

This marked a 30 percent drop compared to the season's premiere, which reached 5.3 million. Overall, the second season is outperforming its predecessor with roughly 3.7 million viewers per episode to date, up from 32 million average viewers each episode by season 1 after 90 days of viewing.
