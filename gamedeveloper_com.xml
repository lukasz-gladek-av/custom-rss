They also expressed disappointment at a perceived lack of food and transportation support and inadequate resting areas for exhibitors that were allegedly told to spend at least 12 hours per day at their booth or risk incurring a penalty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The letter suggested those issues and more meant Gamescom Latam had positioned itself "antagonistically towards developers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This harms precisely those who most need the support, such as the exhibitors in the Panorama Brasil section. This situation becomes even more pronounced when compared to the treatment given to some of the international guests, whose travel and accommodation are often covered, along with other incentives," it added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-corp-responds-to-louisiana-lawsuit-that-claims-it-built-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox Corp responds to Louisiana lawsuit that claims it built 'the perfect place for pedophiles'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom Latam organizers quickly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://latam.gamescom.global/en/answer-to-the-devs-open-letter/">pushed back against those allegations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (even describing some as "factually inaccurate).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, during a recent chat with Game Developer, Falk explained he was taken aback after reading about the controversy and claimed the team in Sao Paulo performed admirably when attempting to support developers in the region.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was surprised when I read about the criticism, because—for example, just remembering one fact—if you're a part of the festival and you can [attend] Gamescom with no money, you have to make sure you as a developer are representing your game to the people," said Falk.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's something we do here at Gamescom in Cologne, as well. [...] We have a big discount for indies so it's cheaper for them, but we request them to be there [at their booth] because that's the beauty of it. So that wasn't anything new. I think it was some kind of miscommunication because I think the team over in Sao Paulo did really well in giving them the opportunity to be part of [the event] without paying."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid similar situations in the future as the Gamescom team attempts to expand both Gamescom Latam in Brazil and Gamescom Asia in Bangkok, Falk said it's important they work with partners who have already established strong events in those territories.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-not-our-aim-to-grow-grow-grow-gamescom-2025-touts-record-exhibitors-but-organizers-says-quality-is-better-than-quantity" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It is not our aim to grow, grow, grow:' Gamescom touts record exhibitors but organizers says quality is better than quantity</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why, for instance, he said Gamescom Asia is moving to Bangkok in 2025 after merging with Thailand Game Show. Even though the B2B portion of the event was strong when it was previously hosted in Singapore, he explained the B2C segment was growing more slowly than hoped.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we talk about Gamescom [in Cologne], we have hundreds of thousands of people [attending]. I think in Gamescom Asia we had like 30,000 or 40,000—but it was also tough because Gamescom Asia in Singapore started right into COVID. The first edition was really tough for the team," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Singapore was also great for business, so we were able to attract many business people and provide a great B2B experience. But for consumers, Singapore is quite expensive and it's hard to get there. You have to fly in. The [cost] of flying into an event is of course much higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hope, then, is that merging with Thailand Game Show and tapping into their experience of hosting a consumer-focused show will help Gamescom Asia strengthen its offering. It will be interesting to see whether developers in Thailand feel the merger has been successful once Gamescom Asia has concluded in October.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-18-arkane-union-brands-microsoft-an-accomplice-to-genocide-krafton-hits-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders-and-is-collective-action-the-answer-to-miscrediting-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #18: Arkane union brands Microsoft an 'accomplice' to genocide, Krafton hits back at Unknown Worlds founders, and is collective action the answer to miscrediting? - Patch Notes #18</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer is attending Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
