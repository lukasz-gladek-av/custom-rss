Instead, Cleveland claimed he "literally transcribed" what he was being told during conversations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed, he repeated that claim, stating the bulk of those notes are "what Owen told us" and have "nothing to do with my opinions at all." He did, however, accept that he chose to document those opinions in his notes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/kim-swift-former-portal-lead-developer-joins-nearstudios-as-coo" target="_self" data-discover="true">Kim Swift, former Portal lead developer, joins NEARstudios as COO</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a vast flurry of thoughts under the header 'Owen Mahoney notes'—dated 6/28/25—the document indicates Krafton would struggle to win the case if it heads to court in Delaware.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Delaware? Oh, they're fucked. You don't even need a Korean lawyer. A dissolution&nbsp;of any kind (marriage, company) is just a deal," reads the exhibit. "Stop worrying about what anyone thinks of your. When the big money comes on the line, the big knives will come out. This is the toughest time in video games since the 80s. This WILL cost CH his job.

Start a new company and hire them. Patrick Sutherland this this with EA (Landmark). So Owen staked him while he started his new company. He did the right thing by his employees. He bought their undying loyalty," the document continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/megabonk-dev-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-over-unqualified-nomination" target="_self" data-discover="true">Megabonk dev withdraws from The Game Awards over 'unqualified' nomination</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[...] Our employees might all quit within 6 months. We can rehire them. Don't lose sleep over this. Don't worry about what you can't control.

Charming until they're incredible [sic] nasty. It goes to 11 quickly. No filter," it adds. "It can be emotionally draining dealing with this, especially as male westerners. Males might be more problem-solvers and bring less emotion—they're [sic] biological reasons for this. Making games is about problem-solving.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Korea has been surrounded by enemies who want to kill them. They are fighters. It's small and nasty. Every year some big film star commits suicide because of sex, drugs or something, hounded by the press.
