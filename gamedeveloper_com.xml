"A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">as reported by Radio Canada</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (via Google Translate), Côté is suing Ubisoft for $1.3 million in damages after claiming he was essentially forced out of the company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit, filed with the Superior Court of Quebec, alleges that Cote was offered a 'head of production' role within Vantage that would have placed him under the authority of a new 'head of franchise.' Côté claims the offer essentially served as a demotion, and would have resulted in a loss of prestige and power.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-tweaks-and-clarifies-ai-disclosure-rules-for-steam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve tweaks and clarifies AI disclosure rules for Steam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September 2025, Ubisoft purportedly restarted negotiations by offering Côté the chance to direct a new 'creative house.' It was a pitch Côté viewed as an "unacceptable downgrade" that constituted a "disguised dismissal."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, Côté reportedly instructed Ubisoft to pay out severance. The company, however, is alleged to have branded his exit a "voluntary departure," which Côté claims is a tactic that will allow Ubisoft to avoid paying compensation and maintain a non-compete clause.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Côté is now demanding two years of salary and $75,000 in moral damages over what he claims is an abuse of power and an infringement on his reputation. He also wants the non-compete to be lifted so he can pursue employment opportunities elsewhere in the video game industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has contracted international business law firm Fasken to challenge the lawsuit.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
