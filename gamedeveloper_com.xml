It debuted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/nintendo-music/">Nintendo Music</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an app dedicated to soundtracks from its storied history. It's available only to Nintendo Switch Online members, making it another unique driver of Nintendo's entry into subscription services.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's just one catch. The app doesn't credit any composers. If you log into the app and pick a song, the "Track information" button just has the name, the game it appears in, and a Nintendo copyright notice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and game music professionals spotted the omission shortly after the app rolled out on October 30, 2024.
