This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp; for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> lets you explore the streets of Quito, Ecuador as an eight year old child caught up in soccer fever, kicking your ball all over town and using it to interact with the places and people you meet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer sat down with Julián Cordero, lead developer of the multi-IGF Award nominated title, to talk about creating a game that focuses on things that happen around a sport as opposed to focusing on just the sport, the intriguing ways they captured the feel of Ecuador in 2001 when they were nearing qualification for the World Cup, and the thoughts that went into how the soccer ball would operate as players experience the world through kicking it all over town.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am Julián Cordero, lead developer and designer of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The rest of the team is Sebastián Valbuena who does the art and music, Gabe Cuzzillo who helps with production, and Ian Berman who does the sound design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I studied game design at the NYU Gamecenter, made a bunch of games back as a student, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was actually my capstone project 6 years ago. We’ve been lucky enough to have received support from various sources to develop it all these years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The soccer culture in Ecuador is huge and I used to play so much of it growing up, but when I moved to NYC I stopped playing and engaging with it as much. When I realized this, I started to think about the role soccer had played in my life and I decided to make a game to explore this idea. I had always played big triple A sports games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FIFA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the soccer you play there didn't represent the kind of soccer I actually grew up playing which took place in neighborhoods and parks—not in big stadiums in front of millions of people. I found that everything that happens around the sport is just as interesting as the sport itself, so we set out to make a game that focused on that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity, Fmod, Scaniverse and Polycam for 3D scanning, Blender, Ableton, and Photoshop.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-making-assassin-s-creed-shadows-strengthened-ubisoft-s-process-for-bringing-history-to-life" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Assassin's Creed Shadows strengthened Ubisoft's process for bringing history to life</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating a world that would offer so much fun, secret stories, and mischief for an eight-year-old to get into?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game is set at a very particular time in the recent history of Ecuador. In 2001, the country had just gone through a big economic crisis and it was very easy for everyone to latch on to the national soccer team for hope since they were on the brink of qualifying to the world cup for the first time ever. This is one of my earliest memories, but it is very hazy and a lot of it is reconstructed from stories I've heard. So when designing the world, we decided to integrate many perspectives into this depiction by having friends and family improvise all the dialogue in the game. We came up with some basic scenarios and told people to pretend like they are 2001 so that they could bring whatever memories they had about it into the recording sessions. The results were always surprising and integrating them into the game became an interesting design challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not writing any of the dialogue allowed me to be a spectator of these moments, so it was very fun to pretend to be eight years old and come up with ways of being mischievous around them. For example, a couple having an anniversary picnic in the park was a lovely conversation from a real-life couple who brought stuff in from their actual relationship into the recording. Wouldn't it be great to be eight years old and use their orange juice as target practice? Maybe the fight that ensues after it splashes has a hint of their real relationship too.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's okay to make a small game:' Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet says tiny ideas contain huge potential</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kicking the soccer ball is pretty satisfying (and not just because you've booted it at someone). What thoughts went into making the soccer ball kicking/dribbling mechanics fun and appealing on their own? Into making them fun in a first-person perspective?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember some of the balls I played with as a kid and how deeply I got to know them. A beaten-up soccer ball has so many stories to tell; it is such a simple object, but it is so versatile. When thinking about how to depict this, our instinct was to try to make it feel very physical. We tried to avoid using magic forces to keep the ball in front of you and instead embrace the unexpected nature of it. The ball bounces around your feet; you never have full control of it, but you can sort of guide it to where you want. The first-person perspective allows the player to have a direct connection and ensure that the ball is always in the foreground. And when the ball is in the foreground, the background conversations and ambiences can slowly seep in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> uses a striking mixture of stylized realistic visuals (drawn from photographs) and animated characters. What appealed to you about this visual mixture? How do these visuals work with your vision for this exploration of Ecuador in 2001?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sebastián had been playing with this kind of aesthetic for a few years before I approached him to be part of the game. I was very inspired by some of his </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyd7YLiWM1M">2D animations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but he had never worked in 3D, so it was a challenge to bring his style into a first-person exploration game. However, when we started experimenting with the art, we quickly realized that the mix of black and white hand-drawn elements with a noisy background established a clear visual language that was intuitive for the player. We committed to this contrast and it gave us much liberty to play around with each style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to work with photographs while creating the world? What effect did you feel this had on the game and how the player will experience its vision of Ecuador in this time period?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly to how we wanted to "source" the dialogue from the real world by having friends and family improvise, we wanted to "source" the environment from the real world. The design of the map is not exactly an actual place in Quito, but we bring in assets from the real world to try to ground the game in a specific setting. It made a lot of sense to use photographs and 3D scans because the textures have so much personality built into them already, which gives the environment a very raw feeling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games have a tendency of trying to avoid depicting the real world, probably because it is technically just as difficult to create a fantasy world as it is a real-life city block. But we have so many ways of capturing the world nowadays, and I think games are the perfect vessel to combine them together.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also work with audio to give the player a real sense of place while exploring </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. Why was it important to capture the sounds of the world alongside the photographic visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think that the more specific a depiction of a place is, the more relatable it can be even for people who have never been to that place. This is especially true for audio, because certain sounds can trigger nostalgic feelings without us fully understanding it. I live in NYC now, but hearing specific birds chirping that Ian recorded brings me back to being a kid in Quito. This is why we really wanted the game to sound like Quito, and Ian did an incredible job recording and mixing it all together.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've all heard the saying "everything has already been done once" when it comes to art and creativity. Fawzi Mesmar challenged this concept at GDC 2025, explaining that ideas can be repeated, but it's our own experiences that take a common concept and make it creatively unique.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest hurdles in game development is coming up with a story. Whether you are trying to figure out the motivation driving your farmer in a cozy sim or flesh out the creepy world of a horror game, we are all aiming to be unique, original, and engaging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An original and creative idea could be the key to a successful game. But what makes an idea original? Mesmar has some specific advice for those looking to harness creativity and get away from accidentally building a hollow repeat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="We are what we watch">We are what we watch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right from the start, Mesmar pressed listeners with the question "What is creativity?" He explained that the concept of creativity is often misunderstood as just "creating something." He instead broke it down as "an idea that is unprecedented." He stated that "what we do inspires us," and it is that inspiration that creates unique ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In game development we see trends as certain concepts with outsize influence on writers and designers. It is especially noticeable in newer devs, who may have set out to make a game solely because they were inspired by a specific title when they were younger.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p>Via ConcernedApe</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via ConcernedApe</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the cozy genre, for example, it is a joke that almost every farming sim that has come out in recent years has a protagonist who is "trying to escape the big city" for a more provincial, relaxing life. This is due to how many cozy players were inspired by and grew up with games like Harvest Moon and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, just including the ingredients isn't enough. As we saw in the recent release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugardew Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, copying what works with other games isn't necessarily creative. However, titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have exploded in popularity, and have been celebrated for their creative and fresh elements. The difference between the two is how the developers injected their own personal experiences into the title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugardew Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has all the right ingredients for a farming sim. Players can craft, farm, raise animals, and sell their crops and products. However, it lacks any depth beyond these core mechanics, leaving players bored and unsatisfied with the gameplay loop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> utilizes unique, 90s-inspired illustrations and anime-like plot points for its story while injecting adorable narrative elements like a "D&amp;D" tabletop game played at the pub on Fridays. It's original, unique, and charming, even if it has similarities to other farming sims.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The takeaway here is that a creative idea has to be more than just building a game around a selection of popular mechanics from other games. It needs depth, originality, and intention. Mesmar says that "originality is making something novel," and he has a key bit of advice for those trying to achieve this.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game designers need to create with intention">Game designers need to create with intention</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mesmar explained that "to achieve creative sobriety, you need to look into yourself and understand your own experiences and constraints."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do this, creatives need to look at a concept and think about how their own experiences in life could be applied to it. Instead of making a farming game where you plant crops and sell them, maybe you make a farming game where you have to teach NPCs how to help in the gardens, as you may have with a family member as a child. The game could be centered around building a thriving community garden and selling crops at a co-op or outdoor market. By diving into personal experiences, creativity blooms into original and unique concepts, even if they are based on something common and relatable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Mesmar says that "original ideas need to have value." You could have a core memory of petting your childhood cat, but does this experience have value? If you made a cat petting game, how would it connect or provide something to a player? If you have a core memory of petting your cat and you turn it into a hyper-realistic pet-groomer simulator or a platformer where the goal is to reach cats and pet them for points, now we are talking about originality. Who wouldn't want to fight baddies to collect cat pets like reward tokens?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creative Sobriety is about being intentional and thoughtful about the ideas we develop. Mesmar encourages those trying to harness their creativity to pause, think, and meditate on the why behind their ideas. By taking the time to consider how a concept connects with you and how it could be used to reach others, you will have the ability to craft truly unique and interesting stories.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written. They are a collector of fantasy and sci-fi novels, a lover of cooking weird food, and a player of farming sims and Pokémon games.
