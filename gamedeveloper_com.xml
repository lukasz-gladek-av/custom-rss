We completed another week in the impossible survival sim that is real life. Give yourself a appreciative pat on the back and gaze wistfully towards whatever adventures or blissful respite the weekend might bring.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This week I've mostly been recovering from my birthday celebrations, which entailed a bountiful Korean Barbecue that left me with a rampant case of the meat sweats and a pub crawl around one of Manchester's finest suburbs. There was no time for video games, but that's not always a bad thing. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, after all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was welcomed back to the imaginary office with a news bludgeon to the face. The headlines this week have come thick and fast, bringing hardware announcements, more layoffs, and some notable sales milestones. As always, there's a lot to digest, so let's venture once more into the fray.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The first Xbox handhelds have finally arrived"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-first-xbox-handhelds-have-finally-arrived">The first Xbox handhelds have finally arrived</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Microsoft finally stopped flirting with the idea of launching a handheld this week and unveiled not one, but two devices called the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The former is&nbsp;pitched towards casual players, while the latter aims to entice hardcore video game aficionados. Both devices were designed in collaboration with Asus and will presumably retail at price points that reflect their respective innards. We don't actually know yet, mind, because Microsoft didn't actually state how much they'll cost. You have the feel that's where the company really needs to stick the landing here.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roughly-half-of-capcom-s-dev-staff-is-focused-on-character-animation-and-visual-effects" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roughly half of Capcom’s dev staff is focused on character animation and visual effects</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Switch 2 tops 3.5 million sales to deliver Nintendo's biggest console launch"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-tops-3-5-million-sales-in-four-days-to-deliver-nintendo-s-biggest-console-launch">Switch 2 tops 3.5 million sales to deliver Nintendo's biggest console launch</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Four days. That's all it took for the Switch 2 to shift over 3.5 million units worldwide to deliver Nintendo's biggest console launch ever. The original Switch needed a month to reach 2.74 million sales by contrast, while the PS5 needed two months to sell 4.5 million units worldwide. Xbox sales remain a mystery because Microsoft just doesn't talk about that sort of thing anymore, which is decidedly frustrating for those oddballs (read: this writer) who actually enjoy sifting through financial documents in search of those juicy juicy numbers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inside the ‘Dragon Age’ Debacle That Gutted EA’s BioWare Studio"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio?embedded-checkout=true">Inside the ‘Dragon Age’ Debacle That Gutted EA’s BioWare Studio</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Bloomberg (paywalled) //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> How do you kill a franchise like Dragon Age and leave a studio with the pedigree of BioWare in turmoil? According to a new report from Bloomberg, the answer will likely resonate with developers across the industry: corporate meddling. Sources speaking to the publication explained how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which failed to meet the expectations of parent company EA, was in constant disarray because the American publisher couldn't decide whether it should be a live-service or single player title. Indecision from leadership within EA and an eventual pivot away from the live-service model only caused more confusion, with BioWare being told to implement foundational changes within impossible timelines. It's a story that's all the more alarming because of how familiar it feels.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-agreement-with-major-studios-that-includes-ai-guardrails-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: SAG-AFTRA suspends strike and instructs union members to return to work</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sony is making layoffs at Days Gone developer Bend Studio"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-is-making-layoffs-at-days-gone-developer-bend-studio">Sony is making layoffs at Days Gone developer Bend Studio</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Sony has continued its Tony Award-winning tun as the Grim Reaper by cutting even more jobs within PlayStation Studios. Days Gone developer Bend Studio was the latest casualty, with the first-party developer confirming a number of employees were laid off just months after the cancellation of a live-service project. Sony didn't confirm how many people lost their jobs, but Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier heard that around 40 people (roughly 30 percent of the studio's headcount) were let go.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors to become executive chair and focus on M&amp;A"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-to-become-executive-chair-and-focus-on-m-a">Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors to become executive chair and focus on M&amp;A</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Somewhere, in a deep dark corner of the world, the monkey's paw has curled. Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors, who demonstrated his leadership nous by spending years embarking on a colossal merger and acquisition spree only to immediately start downsizing, has announced he'll be stepping down as CEO. The catch? Wingefors is currently proposed to be appointed executive chair of the board of Embracer. In his new role, he'll apparently focus on strategic initiatives, capital allocation, and mergers and acquisitions. And people wonder why satire is dead.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reportedly-doomed-by-late-pivot-from-live-service" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Veilguard's late pivot from live service spelled doom for Dragon Age sequel sales</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hong Kong Outlaws a Video Game, Saying It Promotes 'Armed Revolution'"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/world/asia/hong-kong-bans-taiwan-game.html">Hong Kong Outlaws a Video Game, Saying It Promotes 'Armed Revolution'</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via The New York Times (paywalled) // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">National security police in Hong Kong have banned a Taiwanese video game called Reversed Front: Bonfire for supposedly "advocating armed revolution." Authorities in the region warned that anybody who downloads or recommends the online strategy title will face serious legal charges. The game has been pulled from Apple's marketplace in Hong Kong but is still available for download elsewhere. It was never available in mainland China. Developer ESC Taiwan, part of an group of volunteers who are vocal detractors of China's Communist Party, thanked Hong Kong authorities for the free publicity in a social media post and said the ban shows how political censorship remains prominent in the territory.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RuneScape developer accused of ‘catering to American conservatism’ by rolling back Pride Month events"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/06/10/runescape-pride-2025/">RuneScape developer accused of ‘catering to American conservatism’ by rolling back Pride Month events</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via PinkNews // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Runescape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers inside Jagex have reportedly been left reeling after the studio decided to pivot away from Pride Month content to focus more on "what players wanted." Jagex CEO broke the news to staff with a post on an internal message board, prompting a rush of complaints—with many workers explaining the content was either already complete or easy to implement. Though Jagex is based in the UK, it's parent company CVC Capital Partners operates multiple companies in the United States. It's a situation that left one employee who spoke to PinkNews questioning whether the studio has caved to "American conservatism."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="SAG-AFTRA suspends strike and instructs union members to return to work"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-agreement-with-major-studios-that-includes-ai-guardrails-">SAG-AFTRA suspends strike and instructs union members to return to work</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It has taken almost a year, but performer union SAG-AFTRA has finally suspended strike action and instructed members to return to work.

That in itself might not sound too strange, but for a short window the announcement was only accessible via the company's new Nintendo Today mobile app. It's a situation that left people without access to the app questioning whether the news was even real. Nintendo Today prevented users from capturing screenshots or footage, only adding to the sense of confusion. It led to this reporter branding the move a "shadow announcement," which in turn left some of our readers perplexed. Can you ever announce and announcement? What does that term even mean? Food for thought.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A wonderful new Big Walk trailer melted this reporter's heart"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ez7AP4-GM">A wonderful new Big Walk trailer melted this reporter's heart</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via House House (YouTube) //&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The mad lads behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are back with a new jaunt called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Big Walk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This one has been on my radar for a while, but the studio finally debuted a gameplay overview during Summer Game Fest and it looks extraordinary in its purity. It's about walking and talking—and therein lies the charm. Players are forced to cooperate to navigate a lush open world, solve puzzles, and embark upon hijinks. Proximity-based communication is the core mechanic in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Big Walk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—whether that takes the form of voice chat, written text, hand signals, blazing flares, or pictograms—and it looks like it'll lead to all sorts of weird and wonderful antics. It's a pitch that cuts through because it's so unashamedly different, and there's a lot to love about that. I'm looking forward to this one.</span><br></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
