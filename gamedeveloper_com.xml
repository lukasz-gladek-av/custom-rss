That total includes a base salary of $1.3 million, $25.7 million in stock awards, $2.8 million via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 in other compensation that largely includes personal security benefits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a figure that made Wilson the highest-earner on the company's executive team by some margin. Notably, it also confirms Wilson netted a fairly substantial compensation increase on the $25.6 million he received the year prior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does Wilson's compensation package compare to that of your median EA worker? According to EA's pay ratio breakdown for the 2025 fiscal year, the annual total compensation of its "median employee" was $117,302. Or, to put it another way, Wilson earned 260 times more than the median EA worker over the past 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a notable shift compared to the 2024 fiscal year, which saw the median EA employee earn $148,704. In short, that means EA has handed more cash to its top executive while paying workers lessâ€”at least according to the methodology applied by the publisher.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-11-peak-hits-new-heights-layoffs-all-the-way-down-and-union-workers-make-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #11: Peak hits new heights, the layoffs keep on coming, and union workers make history</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less">Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA uses a consistently applied compensation measure (CACM) to identify its median employee, which it explains includes full time, part-time, regular, and temporary staffers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's CACM considers the base salary of workers as of March 15, 2025; discretionary bonuses paid to employees throughout the fiscal year; the grant date fair market value of equity awards granted to employees in fiscal year 2025; and exchange rates used to convert all non-US currencies into US dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other than annualizing base salary for permanent employees, we did not make any compensation adjustments whether for cost of living or otherwise in the identification process," added the company, which noted it's definition of "median employee" has remained consistent since 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, all of the executives listed by EA received compensation increases of varying degrees in 2025. Company CFO Stuart Canfield saw their pay rise to $9.1 million from $6.4 million year-on-year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA Entertainment &amp; Central Development president Laura Miele received a more modest increase, with their compensation increasing to $12.5 million from $12.1 million over the same period.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-unity-senior-program-manager-andy-brammall-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Unity senior program manager Andy Brammall has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've taken the liberty of posting the full compensation table below.
