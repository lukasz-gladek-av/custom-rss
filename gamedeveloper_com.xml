Studio leadership said it needed to cut costs to "safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/stjv-alleges-don-t-nod-management-brutally-advancing-toward-layoffs-encourages-staff-walkout">STJV hit back immediately</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and claimed leadership intended to make workers pay for their "crass ineptitude." The union subsequently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/union-calls-for-extended-strike-at-don-t-nod-with-layoffs-looming">called for walkouts and strikes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while it attempted to negotiate with management, who it accused of stifling its efforts by refusing to move beyond the "bare legal minimum."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Negotiations between STJV and Don't Nod management about the layoffs plan are not conducive to any serious promise to employees. Despite huge efforts from the union delegates to reach a deal, management's offers remain insignificant," read an STJV statement published in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The tide appears to have turned, however, with STJV now explaining it was able to "wring out" a deal thanks to the efforts of colleagues who were determined to fight for their rights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It explained the new deal has "widened the scope for voluntary redundancies" and could save up to 23 jobs by allowing more people to consider accepting a voluntary severance packageâ€”as opposed to a select few being forced out of the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The ability to request a voluntary redundancy will be open to more professional categories, some of which are not targeted for jobs cuts. This could save up to 23 jobs, by letting those who wish to leave go even if they were not intended to, avoiding in return a forced job cut," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/struggle-pays-a-deal-was-found-at-dont-nod/">reads a statement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Whatâ€™s more, the number of jobs being cut has been reduced from 69 to 49, since there were numerous resignations since management announced the PSE, and thanks also to adjustments to managementâ€™s plan following some of the CSE's (workers council) observations when it was informed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">STJV claims anybody who does lose their job will also receive "less indignant terms" in the form of extra-legal compensation paid by Don't Nod. The deal also ensures that anybody who chose to strike between January 13 and January 17 will be paid for those days.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union previously established a strike fund to compensate employees who joined the picket line. That cash will now be used to compensate workers who went on strike in November and December last year. Any remaining funds will be transferred to the STJV's national strike fund.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to thank and congratulate our colleagues for their part in this historic and successful mobilization. Their support and their solidarity were outstanding," continued the STJV. "This victory would not have been reached without the titanic work of the CSE (that was elected under the STJV's banner) and the Don't Nod STJV union section, over four months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And crucially, we send warm thanks to all of those who supported us and who filled the coffers of the strike fund. Collective action gets results, it is our best weapon. Of course, this PSE leaves a bitter taste, and the struggle will continue for both our remaining colleagues' working conditions as well as for the uncertain future that those who will be laid off will have to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not, and it will never be satisfactory to see people be fired. We hope that this struggle will be a stepping stone on which to weigh and from which to start, if any company out there did not get the memo. Hurrah to strikers, and hurrah to strikes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Don't Nod for comment.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
