He chose to make this public because "the last time [Arnt] tried to bully me, I told [him] I’d make it public." Patti also argued that he was a "significant part of building Playdead from the ground up. [...] Without me, Playdead wouldn’t have existed. That’s not ego. That's a fact."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he continued. "I will never erase my own history. You can’t rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup."
