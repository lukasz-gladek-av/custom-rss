That's the conundrum Nintendo is attempting to untangle with the Switch 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch has become the best-selling Nintendo home console of all time by some margin, eclipsing the 101 million lifetime sales of the Nintendo Wii with apparent ease.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If it can top the 154 million sales mustered by the Nintendo DS, it will cement its place as the best-selling Nintendo console in history. That would represent an enormous achievement for the Japanese company–and you have to wonder if it would ever be surpassed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, irrespective of whether the Switch eventually takes that crown, the hybrid device will forever be known as the console that proved Nintendo still had the juice. Its predecessor, the Wii U, sold just 13.56 million units across its lifetime.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a measly return in the aftermath of the Wii's meteoric ascent and raised questions as to whether Nintendo had shot itself in the foot by failing to effectively differentiate the Wii U from the Wii in the mind of consumers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For better or worse, Nintendo isn't making that mistake this time around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-shell-nintendo-finally-unveils-the-tktk-its-successor-to-the-nintendo-switch">In its fleeting reveal trailer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nintendo slapped a colossal '2' next to the Switch logo and showed the original console transform into something familiar yet different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a serpent shedding its skin, the Switch 2 is a more refined version of its forebear. A distinctly 'new' offering that still feels immediately recognisable. New buttons, more curves, additional ports, and reworked Joy-Cons that some viewers believe hide a spark of creativity are the immediate differentiators, but those additions represent iteration rather than revolution.</span></p><p>It's definitely another Switch</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has previous in that regard. The company often produces revamped versions of existing tech. The Switch OLED, Nintendo 3DS XL, and Wii Mini all spring to mind. Where the Switch 2 differs is in how it will mark the beginning of a new hardware cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For years, we've become accustomed to Nintendo kicking off a fresh generation with barmy, unpredictable experimentation. Irreverent technology (and jubilant first-party software to match) that can't reasonably be compared to the rotund boxes released by Microsoft and Sony. This time, Nintendo is joining its rivals in playing it safe. In promising more of the same, but better, and hoping that'll be enough to repeat the success of the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an understandable position given the company's not-to-distant failings, but one that feels distinctly un-Nintendo. It's entirely possible the Switch 2 is hiding a few new tricks. Some keen-eyed viewers posit the reworked Joy-Cons could double as mouse-like controllers, offering new ways to play. Yet, Nintendo doesn't plan on releasing concrete tech specs for another couple of months, so that remains wishful speculation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reinventing the wheel is overrated–just ask 12,000 years of wheels">Reinventing the wheel is overrated–just ask 12,000 years of wheels</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking into account what we do know, the Switch 2 appears overwhelmingly beige. The vibrant colourways of the original Joy-Cons have been ditched in favor of homogenous grey. A bigger screen promises a little extra real-estate, but it's unclear whether Nintendo is prepared to make OLED the standard. A new 'C' button has spawned theories galore, but it's probably sensible to temper expectations as to how much innovation can be squeezed into a single input.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact there is so much speculation over so little suggests the industry is struggling to reconcile itself with the idea of a Nintendo that is content (at least for now) to temper its adventurous side in pursuit of what it must feel are guaranteed returns.</span></p><p>A modern mystery worthy of Miss Marple</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we've already covered, the Switch sold like diamond-encrusted hot cakes slathered in gold. A key part of that success was how Nintendo was able to hit a palatable price point and gently iterate with the Switch Lite and OLED models, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/20-of-last-year-s-switch-sales-were-to-households-that-already-owned-one">encouraging multiple sales within the same household</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If it can do the same again, you'd have to expect a comparable uptake.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo's first-party catalogue has also been superlative over the years, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (a more complete version of the Wii U release) having </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">sold over 64 million units on the Switch alone</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's no surprise Nintendo seemingly chose to tease a new entry in the franchise alongside the Switch 2. Others like Animal Crossing, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Super Mario, and The Legend of Zelda chipped in with aplomb, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">selling eye-watering amounts over the years.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, it's vital to consider the console's wider impact. If imitation if the sincerest form of flattery, then Nintendo must feel like the bell of the ball. A massive list of hardware companies and platform holders have attempted to replicate the form factor of the Switch in the eight years since it launched. The Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and so many others all promise some version of portable gaming in a Switch-like package. Hell, even Microsoft is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-touts-new-consoles-teases-handhelds">openly talking about developing a handheld</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in what would be a notable first for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the reality of the post-Switch world. It cannot be understated just how influential Nintendo's hybrid device has become since debuting in 2017. For the first time in decades, here was a machine that genuinely changed how we played by dissolving the barrier between handheld and home consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will I be disappointed if the Switch 2 is completely devoid of whimsy? Yes, there will be pangs of melancholy, but then I also trust Nintendo to innovate in other ways. This is the company that turned The Legend of Zelda into a physics playground with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, implemented a mechanic called 'Mouthful Mode' just to let Kirby swallow an entire automobile, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-000000000010013963">developed an alarm clock dubbed ALARMO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because why the fuck not? Maybe we shouldn't despair just yet.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
