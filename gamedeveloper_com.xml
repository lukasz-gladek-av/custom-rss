It's a question former Sony Santa Monica director of product development, Meghan Morgan Juinio, and Gearbox Montreal executive producer Fleur Marty grappled with during an on-stage conversation at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, Juinio provided some context to explain why answering that question is so important. She noted that, according to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2025-data/">Entertainment Software Association's latest 'Annual Facts' report on the U.S. video game industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, around 205 million Americans currently play video games—and 47 percent of those players identified as women.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how many women are building video games?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-2025-state-of-the-game-industry-devs-weigh-in-on-layoffs-ai-and-more">GDC State of the Industry survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> found that around 25 percent of developers identified as women. Discussing that data, Juinio questioned how many of those respondents were game directors or studio heads? How many are executives sitting at the top of the table, making decisions about which titles get funded?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think over the past five to ten years, collectively around the world, we've put a great amount of effort and energy into bringing more girls into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We've created more pathways for girls in high school and university to have mentorship and internship programs that create pathways for entry-level roles in the game industry," said Juinio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/outsourcing-studio-atomhawk-closes-canadian-branch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sumo Group-owned outsourcing studio Atomhawk closes Canadian branch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to continue that, but I believe this is a 'yes and' conversation here. So, now what? How do we bring more women along to influence the content that gets into the hand of the players?"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To find out, I took advantage of a Q&amp;A session to ask Juinio and Marty how major publishers and studios—such as the ones that promoted them into senior positions—can take practical steps to help women who wish to pursue leadership roles?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;If you don't ask the question you'll never know&quot;">"If you don't ask the question you'll never know"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Juinio said there are many opportunities for companies to put their best foot forward in that regard. "One of them, which is quite basic, is to collect the data and share the data with hiring managers," she explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm not advocating for quotas or for top-down forced [hiring policies] that dictate what the team makeup needs to look like from a gender perspective, but If your hiring managers don't have awareness of what the makeup of the teams look like, how can they be part of the evolution we want to inspire here? So collect the data and share the data."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She added that employers should also strive to find and nurture cohorts of like-minded women within their studios by establishing development programs that allow women from different disciplines to connect. "Maybe there's one female engineer on Team A and two female animators on Team B and one female designer on Team F, way over there," Juinio continued. "But do they know each other? Do they have opportunities to meet and connect? I think really looking to foster connection and support and this sense of community will really help women to be stronger."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-persona-5-series-has-sold-over-13-million-copies" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million copies</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marty agreed and noted how, when she worked at Warner Bros. Montreal, she kickstarted a Slack channel called 'Women of Warner' to unite women from different disciplines.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the time, developers were very separated from QA—because QA was on the publishing side and handling all of the titles for the company, while devs were just at Warner Montreal," she recalled.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But I said 'no, anybody who worked at Warner Montreal should be part of this and it allowed a lot of the women in QA to connect with devs and ask them questions. It's so simple and it's free and it's the most basic thing, but allowing that connection [helps]."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marty added that companies should be proactive in identifying women who want to pursue leadership opportunities to figure out how to meet their specific needs. "Not everybody wants a leadership role," she added. "Some people are happy to remain individual contributors and experts, but if you don't ask the question you'll never know. So identify them and then ask 'what's the path [for this person]? What does that look like?' and start building."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-owner-krafton-outlines-plans-to-transform-into-an-ai-first-company" target="_self" data-discover="true">Subnautica owner Krafton outlines plans to transform into an 'AI First' company</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
