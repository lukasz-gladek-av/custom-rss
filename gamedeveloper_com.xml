As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close–however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio said it could have released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FM25</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in its current state and rolled out fixes at a later date, but felt that would have been the wrong decision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also suggested that pushing the release date back again would result in the title launching too late in the football season, potentially disrupting the cadence of future releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio will now focus on the next entry in the long-running soccer management sim.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect," it continued.
