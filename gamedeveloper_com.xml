Barrett argued his firing was "unfounded" and accused Bungie and Sony of firing him to avoid giving him a $45 million payout from his employee agreement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony's response counters Barrett's accusations, saying the investigation against him revealed his "consistent" behavior toward the unnamed employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"He&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower-level, female&nbsp;employee&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the&nbsp;employee&nbsp;by making subtle references to her physical appearance&nbsp;or expressing&nbsp;his interest&nbsp;in her romantically," the response begins. "Barrett attempted to create&nbsp;an unprofessional level of&nbsp;intimacy with&nbsp;his&nbsp;victims."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The response goes on to allege Barrett frequently brought up "inappropriate topics" toward these women, such as their physical appearance, and would text them "at all hours of the day and night."

However, it's claimed he would continue the pattern after initially backing off. His alleged behavior "made multiple female employees who were subordinate to him&nbsp;feel&nbsp;uncomfortable, fear retaliation, and&nbsp;feel&nbsp;victimized&nbsp;by their encounters with&nbsp;him.&nbsp;This&nbsp;impeded their ability to perform their job duties and thereby hindered [our] business operations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Legal representatives for Barrett told Game File that Sony continues to "disingenuously cherrypick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. [...] Nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Barret has previously argued Bungie had a history of workplace toxicity that he was witness to. His initial lawsuit mentioned a "very senior executive" texting him and other high-level staffers inappropriate material and texts about the appearance of women employees at the studio. Sony said it "lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations," but remain firm in its overall argument.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Barrett’s allegations that he&nbsp;was&nbsp;'scapegoated,' 'falsely accused, and 'defamed' are outrageous considering the evidence," continued Sony. "Hundreds of&nbsp;Barrett’s own written statements and the&nbsp;direct testimony of&nbsp;his many victims will demonstrate his termination for Cause was justified and this lawsuit is meritless."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony's full response can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
