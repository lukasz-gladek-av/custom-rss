In what's billed a "series-first" occurrence, the game will let trainers and their Pokémon&nbsp;take active action during fights with other monsters. Since its inception, the mainline games have used a turn-based system wherein one or two Pokémon&nbsp;take turns going at one another until their enemy's health falls, with occasional shakeups for specific entries like Dynamaxing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2022's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon&nbsp;Legends: Arceus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let players roam the field while their pocket monster squared off against a wild beast, who could subsequently target </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>them</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for attack. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Z-A </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is an evolution of that concept, and players will still command their Pokémon&nbsp;to use specific moves from a selected list of four.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It's not what you fight, it's how you fight it">It's not what you fight, it's how you fight it</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combat plays a heavy part in RPGs, and implementation can vary wildly from game to game.
