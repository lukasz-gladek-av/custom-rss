Patch Notes has returned after a longer-than-expected hiatus and much like this journalist, who is celebrating their 32nd birthday tomorrow, has aged like that top shelf wine behind the counter at your local Bargain Booze. It's similar, but a little bit different—and hopefully still largely palatable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In its new format, Patch Notes will take center stage each Friday to spotlight the week's biggest headlines and most fascinating news tidbits. We like to think you read everything we publish here at Game Developer, but on the rare occasion you're too busy with other life antics we hope Patch Notes will become your one-stop-shop for game industry news. A buffet of headlines you can savor at your leisure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's like a cozy breakfast in bed, but instead of perfectly seasoned eggs on toast its executives putting their feet directly into their own mouths while the industry implodes. I jest, of course. We also have other news. Anyway, that's enough British cynicism for one week. Let's get on with the main event, shall we? Here's everything that happened in the wonderful world of video games over the past seven days:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="People Can Fly blames Square Enix for latest layoffs and project cancelations"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/people-can-fly-blames-square-enix-for-latest-layoffs-and-project-cancelations">People Can Fly blames Square Enix for latest layoffs and project cancelations</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">More layoffs and project cancellations at Polish studio People Can Fly, but this time the company claims its hand was forced by Japanese publisher Square Enix. In a series of scathingly blunt current reports outlining the situation, People Can Fly accused Square Enix of failing to draft a content rider relating to additional work on Project Gemini—which the Japanese company was slated to publish. People Can Fly said the uncertainty caused by that inaction resulted in the suspension of two projects (including Gemini) and 60 layoffs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-screen-punctures-raise-questions-over-hardware-packaging" target="_self" data-discover="true">Reports of Switch 2 screen punctures raise questions over hardware packaging</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It’s official: There are no Nintendo Switch 2 reviews"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/opinion/its-official-there-are-no-nintendo-switch-2-reviews-heres-what-that-means-for-us-and-you/">It’s official: There are no Nintendo Switch 2 reviews</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via VGC // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 finally landed this week, but those in the business of hardware reviews found themselves waiting to scramble together launch coverage after Nintendo declined to send review units out to reporters ahead of time. As noted by VGC, the Japanese company said hardware was held back because "important features and updates" will only be available on June 5. It's a blow for both journalists and consumers, with the former likely having to rush through reviews and the latter having the wait for comprehensive coverage. Will Nintendo care? Given Switch 2 pre-orders have bolted out the door, probably not.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Witcher 4 tech demo highlights the open world credentials of Unreal Engine 5.6"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-highlights-the-open-world-credentials-of-unreal-engine-5-6">The Witcher 4 tech demo highlights the open world credentials of Unreal Engine 5.6</a></h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subway-surfers-blast-developer-outplay-entertainment-has-laid-off-21-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">Subway Surfers Blast developer Outplay Entertainment has laid off 21 workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Unreal Engine 5.6 is here, but that wasn't necessarily the big reveal during Epic's annual State of Unreal showcase. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maker kicked off the show with a very impressive technical demo set inside the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Witcher 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Speaking to IGN, he claimed AI prompts will become a "fundamental part" of game engines and could even allow for "infinite dialogue" without the need for writers or actual creative input. "What would it take for a 10-person team to build a game like Zelda Breath of the Wild in which the AI is just doing all the dialogue and you're just writing some character synopsis?," he pondered. The answer, one could suggest, might have already been revealed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where Epic recently debuted an AI-powered version of Darth Vader capable of learning slurs.

I bet you didn't think that's where that sentence was going. Although it might not set hearts fluttering unless you're a bonafide brawlhead, it's still fascinating to see Sony experiment with new hardware for PlayStation—and in this instance, PC too. The wireless device, codenamed Project Defiant, has been designed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and sports nifty features like interchangeable restrictor gates, buttons with mechanical switches, and a DualSense-esque touchpad. It also gets bonus points for looking properly slick.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Activision Insists Heavily Criticized Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Ads in Loadout Menus Were a 'Test' Published 'In Error,' Strips Them Out Following Backlash"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash">Activision Insists Heavily Criticized Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Ads in Loadout Menus Were a 'Test' Published 'In Error,' Strips Them Out Following Backlash</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via IGN // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Everybody's favourite multi-billion-dollar conglomerate Activision Blizzard played another blinder this week when it added in-game store advertisements to player loadouts in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone. As you can imagine, this went down like a lead balloon with players, who lambasted the Microsoft subsidiary for attempting to milk users who'd already forked out on a premium product. Activision acknowledged the issue and claimed the ads were the result of a "UI feature test" that was published in error. Hey, mistakes happen, but perhaps the bigger concern is that Activision had already deemed the feature worthy of testing. What's that saying again—it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Power up!

It's a slice of positive news for developers in the region, with the cash being dished out through The Games Scale Up Fund for Wales—the first scheme of its kind. The program was launched earlier this year by Creative Wales in partnership with the UK Games Fund and aims to help Welsh developers expand their projects beyond the 'pilot' stage. The recipients this time around include Cloth Cat, COPA Gaming, Goldborough Studios, Rocket Science, Sugar Creative, and Wales Interactive.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Court denies Apple appeal in Epic Games case, keeping App Store changes in place"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/apple-appeal-epic-games-app-store.html">Court denies Apple appeal in Epic Games case, keeping App Store changes in place</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via CNBC //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Apple has tried and failed to appeal a ruling that will prevent it from charging commissions on third-party payment links inside its apps—or telling developers how those links should look.

Epic eventually won out, paving the way for Fortnite to return to the App Store in the United States after a five year hiatus. As noted by CNBC, Apple says it will continue arguing over how third-party payments are implemented to ensure the App Store remains a "safe and trusted experience for our users." Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said the latest ruling means the "long national nightmare of the Apple tax is ended."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
