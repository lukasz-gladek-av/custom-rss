"They also support families of fire fighters that have died on the job, and grants for community organizations that rebuild affected areas over the long term."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sheffield said the California Fire Relief Bundle will help those affected by the fires by providing direct financial assistance and grands to rebuild communities. He plans to launch the bundle on January 20 and reiterated the call is for paid products only.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are asking game developers, tabletop creators, anyone who makes paid products on itch to submit their work to this bundle," Sheffield added. "We are making this bundle to do good, but some folks will be buying it because of the 'value' for better or for worse. More free games also increases the vetting process on our end dramatically. This means all free games will be rejected."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sheffield has previously organized or participated in charity bundles in aid of Ukraine and Palestine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can find out more about the bundle, including details on how to submit your title and an extensive FAQ, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/jam/california-fire-relief-bundle">on the Itch.io website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
