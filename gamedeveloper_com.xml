Current public resources often require you to give away your personal data or are just fractions of relevant information."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Deviant Legal's guide is divided into 14 sections touching on topics like audits, royalties, future games, marketing, and legal terms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each section is then broken down into sub-sections. For instance, the Audit Clause section—which details a developer's right to double check royalty calculations—breaks down&nbsp;exactly what an audit clause is, why it matters, and how it might be implemented into a contract.&nbsp;It also details&nbsp;how a developer might review and negotiate audit clauses in their contracts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/supercell-ceo-claims-proposed-eu-regulations-around-digital-currencies-will-kill-how-games-work-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Supercell CEO claims proposed EU regulations around digital currencies will 'kill how games work'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the Future Games and Exclusivity section, Otto and his team explain what clauses and terminology might appear in a contract—and how to approach contract details related to intellectual property rights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some lawyers asked me whether I am not scared to give away this resource, because we give away 'too much information,'" Otto said on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are not, because we know we add value to any publishing deal negotiation we are involved with.
