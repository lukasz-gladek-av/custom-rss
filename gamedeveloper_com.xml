            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via GDC Festival of Gaming.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the first time in many years </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference (GDC)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is undergoing a major content and pricing overhaul that will shape the future of the event. Today GDC, which is owned by Game Developer parent company Informa, unveiled the new "reimagined" conference known as "GDC Festival of Gaming," bringing with it a shift in event structure designed to "meet today's broader, interconnected games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A major component of this transformation is a simplified pass structure that offers equal access to sessions and networking events to all attendees. The new event pass starts at $649, though indies, start-ups, and academics can apply for discounts that lower the price by another $200-$300.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this new form, the event aims to serve game makers "across every stage of a game's life cycle," and debuts with a particular focus on providing game industry professionals with new networking opportunities, redesigned conference content, improved pass pricing, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conference organizers state that these changes are "informed and inspired by feedback from the community." In a statement, GDC executive director of innovation and growth Mark DeLoura commented that this transformation is taking place during "a time of great change" in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-with-immediate-effect" target="_self" data-discover="true">Remedy CEO Tero Virtala steps down with immediate effect</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can build walls or build bridges—and the game industry has always thrived by coming together," says DeLoura.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An &quot;All Access&quot; GDC now costs 45 percent less">An "All Access" GDC now costs 45 percent less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned above, the event's new "Festival Pass" replaces the All-Access pass from prior years and costs 45 percent less than its predecessor, starting as low as $649 and granting access to the entirety of the event's main content programming.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means that all attendees with a Festival Pass in hand will have equal access to the GDC expo hall (now named "Festival Hall") and content programming throughout the week, a departure from previous GDC events where access to main conference content was segmented by pass type, track, or day of the week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the announcement, GDC also plans to offer support to early-stage indies, start-ups, and members of the academic community through programs that further reduce the Festival Pass pricetag by $200-$300.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The new Festival Pass is one of only three overall pass types unveiled by GDC today. One, a new "Digital Pass", allows developers not making the trek to San Francisco to access online-only networking during GDC and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gdcvault.com/">GDC Vault</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> content for $799.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other new pass type, the "Game Changer Pass", starts at $1,699 and brings all that the Festival Pass has to offer in addition access to all new show features and more. Those include the "GamePlan" facilitated meetings program, an invite-only arrangement promising pre-scheduled meetings with key industry stakeholders, and the all new "Luminaries Speaker Series", an executive-level content program held at the Blue Shield of California Theater at YBCA near the Moscone Center.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-massive-initiates-voluntary-buyouts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft Massive initiates voluntary buyouts</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Meeting &quot;today's broader, interconnected&quot; industry">Meeting "today's broader, interconnected" industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going beyond just pricing, today's Festival of Gaming announcement gives developers a closer look at what to expect from an overhauled event. According to organizers, GDC Festival of Gaming aims to serve what they call "the global B2B game ecosystem," which includes "game-makers, publishers, distributors, investors, founders, technologists, toolmakers, marketers, educators, and media."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reimagined approach to sessions "[goes] beyond discipline-specific learning for game makers," with lectures, panels, mixers, workshops, and other events aimed at industry professionals of all stripes. This "Unified Content Program" spans all five days of GDC and is available to any attendee with a Festival Pass. Event staples like postmortems and technical sessions are now joined by "interactive content" that aims to bridge the gap between industry disciplines.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/outerloop-games-lays-off-multiple-employees" target="_self" data-discover="true">Outerloop Games lays off multiple employees</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A similar spirit fuels the return of GDC Nights and the redesigned Expo Hall, now known as the "Festival Hall." These spaces offer developers opportunities to connect through demos, micro-sessions, and social spaces designed around themes of game development, future tech, indie &amp; education, international, monetization &amp; player engagement.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a statement, GDC president Nina Brown described the new event as "celebrating the vital interconnection between creators, leaders, and partners that drive the industry forward."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This new era is rooted in dialogue with our community," she continued.

PDS Black, one of the development teams under the Paradox umbrella, has a rigorous system in place to address feedback and provide post-release support. Deciding when to move on and allocate resources into the next thing, however, continues to be tricky.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”It has to happen,“&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;producer Maria-Lucia Dzediti told Game Developer during an interview at Tokyo Game Show. “Sometimes it’s circumstances that decide it rather than us wanting to. You have a super creative and passionate team, they would love to keep working on the same thing for three years if it meant having a perfect, flawless experience. But it’s about prioritizing.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to game breaking bugs, the team seeks to address them as soon as possible. As for “nice to have’s” suggested by players, the team usually considers them for future work plans, including free patches, since they are committed to releasing at least one free patch for every paid release. These patches address, among other things, past community concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”We basically keep a backlog and our community team is super good at finding that on the forums, prioritizing it, keeping an active backlog and then updating with every release,” Dzediti said. “We have a collection of these. And then, I don't know, it's like playing darts, you just shoot. We have an internal process where we prioritize these and see what works best with the staffing we have for a particular release at a certain point in time, and try to put them in there.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There are always things to tweak in a huge, complex game">There are always things to tweak in a huge, complex game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as QA manager Riad Deneche told Game Developer, the team reviews this internal process after every release, as there are “always things to tweak.” This is due to the fact that the team considers the DLC support of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;to be live service, which constitutes different development considerations from making the base game. Every DLC brings an opportunity to learn and bring in, as Deneche said, new ways of working that are more focused and efficient.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back on September 9, PDS Black released&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coronations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, adding to the extensive DLC for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players quickly scrutinized it, however, primarily due to a bug that caused a problem with oaths. The developer issued a fix to address this and other issues within 24 hours of release, while also including an apology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coronations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” reads a post penned by Deneche in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">Paradox forums</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. “As the QA manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the QA vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-secrets-of-dead-cells-smart-constraints-unlocking-the-vault-3" target="_self" data-discover="true">The secrets of Dead Cells' smart constraints - Unlocking the Vault #3</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about what said standard constitutes, the QA manager said that it’s important for the team to keep a “certain stance of quality that people expect from our games.” This stance includes the technical standard of a game running well and not having any major issues, as well as the fun factor. QA, for example, doesn’t just test functionality but also fantasies, as it’s fundamental for a game like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;to ensure that historical niches work properly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“[The players are] very dedicated people, they can’t expect any less than us also being dedicated [to] the game itself,” Deneche said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working in parallel with several DLCs at the same time has taught the team many lessons throughout the years. One of them has been to not focus too narrowly, to look at the big picture, deciding on different priorities based on the scope of each release, considering the testing involved. This is important considering that everything added to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;intertwines with a myriad of existing and forthcoming DLC.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away-at-58" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Once you keep adding content to the game, you have to make sure it works with what you already have in the game, and the thing you'll be adding in five years from now,” Dzediti said. “The team that was there when we released the live game, you don't know when you're going to release a game that this is what keeping it alive five years into is going to look like.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“But it's what we're learning and what we're trying to do. And I think a lot of it we're doing by listening to the community because they play it more than we do, honestly.“</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Committing to the dev diary">Committing to the dev diary</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the ways in which the team has been listening to the community more closely is with dev diaries, which started with the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roads to Power</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;DLC back in September 2024. This has allowed PDS Black to share materials and ideas with the community early on in development and ask them for feedback, which in turns lets developers observe how players react to possible fantasies or different ways of expanding the map, for example.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“The earlier we do it, the more sort of creative freedom we have to create the freedom in time, because the reality of game development is you have to do it in a short time, and that's the challenge,” Dzediti said. “I think both us here and the whole team back home wish we could take all that feedback and turn it into something, you know, concrete within the time we have, but sadly, it doesn't always work out.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
