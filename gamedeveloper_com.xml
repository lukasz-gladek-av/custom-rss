We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations.

And we think we've generally speaking, gotten that right," he added&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Variable pricing has been the nature of this industry forever. Most frontline releases, we'll go out at a higher price, so sometimes with special additions. And then over time, usually, the price is discounted to optimize for the largest possible market.
