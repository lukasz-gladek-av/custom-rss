The old standbys like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto V, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the NBA 2K series, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were the biggest contributors here, with Firaxis' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sid Meier's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Civilization</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> getting a tip of the cap for helping driving up revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If all goes according to plan, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Borderlands 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the 2026 iterations of NBA 2K and WWE 2k will see the company rake in about $6 billion in revenue and net bookings by this time next year.
