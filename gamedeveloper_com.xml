According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-whistleblower-research-kids-vr-former-employees-stock-rcna230131">NBC News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/08/meta-research-child-safety-virtual-reality/">Washington Post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, two current and two former employees have testified </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hidden-harms-examining-whistleblower-allegations-that-meta-buried-child-safety-research">before the US Senate Judiciary Committee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the company suppressed internal research indicating children and teens were at risk of exposure to sexual harassment and abuse while using its VR products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the heart of the allegations is an interview with a German family where researcher Jason Sattizahn was told by a teenager that—despite his mother's wishes—he and his younger brother frequently encountered strangers while using Meta's virtual reality platform. The teen claimed that some of those strangers had sexually propositioned the younger sibling (it's not clear if this abuse took place in Meta's in-house game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or another virtual reality title).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sattizahn testified to the Senate that his supervisor ordered that the interview be deleted. Fellow researcher Cayce Savage also testified that she became aware that "it is not uncommon" for children using Meta VR devices to experience "bullying, sexual assault, to be solicited for nude photographs and sexual acts by pedophiles, and to be regularly exposed to mature content like gambling and violence, and to participate in adult experiences like strip clubs and watching pornography with strangers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Savage said Meta did not allow her to investigate how many minors had been exposed to this material.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Meta says allegations of in-game child abuse are false">Meta says allegations of in-game child abuse are false</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told NBC that the claims being investigated by the committee are "nonsense." "They're based on selectively-leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative," he stated, also denying that Meta issued a "blanket prohibition" on researching young users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stone had been referring to documents provided to the Committee and the Post, one of which contained a message from a Meta lawyer saying a user-experience researcher should avoid collecting data showing children were using Quest devices "due to regulatory concerns."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These documents also allege that Meta was aware that many minors were accessing its virtual worlds even while they were supposed to only be available to adults age 18 and over. Some showed messages from employees who witnessed older users asking children where they lived over in-game voice chat. Others indicated that lawyers working with user research teams offered guidance aimed at side skirting the question of whether minors were using Meta VR devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In one message from a company official contained in the documents, employees were reportedly told that they should &nbsp;"avoid saying 'kids' like we know for sure they are kids — instead use 'alleged Youth' or 'alleged minors with young-sounding voices who may be underage.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meta does ask users to identify their age when creating accounts for any of its services—but according to internal research included in documents submitted to the Senate, when Meta asked users to verify their age, only 41 percent of users across all age groups gave the same date of birth as the one had previously submitted. A Meta spokesperson reminded the Post that it requires users to verify their age with an ID or credit card if it is worried they are lying about their age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer has reached out to Meta for comment on this story.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
