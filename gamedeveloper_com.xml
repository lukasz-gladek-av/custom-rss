"To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The letters, available alongside the press release, are addressed to Discord CEO Humam Sakhnini, Valve president Gabe Newell, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. The hearing will take place on Wednesday, October 8. Congress is asking the executives to provide a written testimony at least two business days prior to the hearing.
