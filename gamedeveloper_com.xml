Weeks before its launch, technical director Yukata Ito shared a photo of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/YutakaIto_RGG/status/1745050214476677561">game's source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's an uncommon move for triple-A developers, and in a late November interview with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/like-a-dragons-programmers-publicly-shared-some-of-infinite-wealths-source-code-as-a-message-to-aspiring-programmers-we-ask-them-about-the-unprecedented-decision/">Automaton Media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Ito said it was his way of offering encouragement to prospective coders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I created an X account in the first place because I felt like there weren’t many game developers out there spreading technical information for people who want to become programmers," Ito told Automaton. He noted the hurdles aspiring developers can face when they try learning from their established peers, and hoped his thread would help future devs see how programming can be "surprisingly simple."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Programming manager Tomoaki Nakamura similarly acknowledged how common secrecy is in game development, and how people assumed there was "some kind of special programming" used for the Like a Dragon games. He hopes that by showing RGG uses "ordinary" C++, it proves the language "is enough for anyone to be able to make a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ito, graduates who apply at Sega don't know C++. However, he believes they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>should, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">since a "lot of high-end titles" are made in the technical language. "If you want to be involved in console game development," he suggested, "it’s a good idea to gain experience creating games in C++ while you’re still a student."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By his own admission, that thread "pushed the limits" on what RGG is allowed to make public. But he stressed the move was made with consultation from each team before showing the source code, including the programmer who wrote it. The parts he chose were "relatively clean," which he hoped would make for good reactions, and be intentionally beginner-friendly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Like a Dragon, like a programmer">Like a Dragon, like a programmer</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a Dragon games release on a near-yearly basis, and sometimes two games per year. To help onboard newcomers and "resolve issues as soon as they come up," RGG veterans (programming and otherwise) are often placed next to newer staff to foster easier communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always tell our new programmers to respect people in other teams," Ito explained to Automaton. "I instruct them to...try to to be considerate towards the other party. This kind of reliable attitude makes the designers and planners more inclined to consult with the programmers, and I believe this is very beneficial for interpersonal relationships in the studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We require our programmers at RGG to not only work as instructed," he continued, "but to form and voice their own opinions on the game’s design and contribute towards improving the game, so we train them in this area as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To aspiring programmers, Ito said the profession is for anyone "as long as they have learned the basics of programming. [It's] not only for those who have studied it professionally. [...] If you are working in another industry with the dream of becoming a game programmer, we encourage you to apply for the mid-career job openings at RGG Studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can read Automaton's full interview with Ito and Nakamura about programming for the Like a Dragon series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/like-a-dragons-programmers-publicly-shared-some-of-infinite-wealths-source-code-as-a-message-to-aspiring-programmers-we-ask-them-about-the-unprecedented-decision/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire. In addition to Game Developer, his writing can be found at io9 over on Gizmodo. Don't ask him about how much gum he's had, because the answer will be more than he's willing to admit.</span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
