According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the move appears in keeping with Netflix's changing priorities, evidenced as well by the shutdown of an internal studio known as Team Blue last year. Spry Fox appears to have a more hopeful fate. Netflix has reportedly sold the studio back to its original creators, though exact details on the sale are scarce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is described as a "beautiful cooperative life-sim about building friendships and community" and is currently in alpha testing. The title will remain in development, with Netflix publishing and Spry Fox reportedly free to shop it around to other platforms as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spry Fox was founded in 2010. The studio saw early hits like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Triple Town</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Bear</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, followed up by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cozy Grove</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (and later, its sequels via Netflix). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been in the proverbial oven for "well over four years", according to the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://spryfox.com/2025/03/19/announcing-spirit-crossing/">announcement post this past spring</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team was effusive about the support the streaming service provided in its blog about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, noting:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In all honesty, being part of Netflix has been a huge relief for us. As you may or may not be aware, starting sometime around 2022, the video game industry was taking a very serious turn for the worse (economically-speaking). Our industry has been experiencing its most serious downturn in decades. All around us, studios are doing layoffs or, worse, shutting down entirely. To call this "dispiriting" would be a severe understatement… we have been very worried about our friends in the industry...</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hideo-kojima-to-deliver-keynote-at-gdc-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hideo Kojima to deliver keynote at GDC 2026</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Netflix has given Spry Fox more support and encouragement than we've ever experienced before.
