Since then, according to Kunes, the big three have been pursuing a multidisciplinary approach by integrating advanced technology, research-driven insights, supportive community efforts, and skilled human oversight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the principles revolves around prevention by "empowering" players and parents to easily understand and control the experience in each platform. This ranges from informing both groups about codes of conduct and terms of use to designing products with transparency at their core.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We recognize that for safety features to be useful, they must be easy to use and understand," Kunes wrote. "We promote the availability of our safety tools and provide guidance on how to use them through our platforms, support channels, services, on our websites, and in retail stores to reach more players and parents."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-lays-off-staff-at-batman-arkham-shadow-dev-camouflaj" target="_self" data-discover="true">Meta lays off staff at Batman: Arkham Shadow dev Camouflaj</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, there's partnership, with the update including a list of publishers, regulators, and communities that the companies work with to "advance" player safety. These include the Thriving in Games Group and the Family Online Safety Institute, ratings agencies such as ESRB and PEGI, the Entertainment Software Association, and industry initiatives like the Tech Coalition and its Lantern program, the latter of which are dedicated to enhancing child safety.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Responsibility and accountability for improved safety">Responsibility and accountability for improved safety</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, Kunes emphasized responsibility as a third principle, in which the companies vow to hold themselves accountable for making their platforms as safe as possible for all players. For starters, this includes making it easy for users to report violations of their codes of conduct and community guidelines, as well as "removing content not suitable for our services." For the latter, Kunes said the companies take "appropriate enforcement actions for violations," which include restricting players from using services for misconduct, with escalating restrictions for "egregious or repeat violations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Responsibility, according to the update, also extends to complying with all applicable laws in the places the companies do business and responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement. "We promptly notify law enforcement if we observe unlawful conduct or where we believe a player is at risk of imminent harm," Kunes wrote.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playtika-cutting-15-percent-of-global-workforce-in-pursuit-of-ai-and-automation-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Playtika cutting 15 percent of global workforce in pursuit of 'AI and automation'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This partnership reflects our dedication to collaborating on solutions that enhance player safety and ensure our games are welcoming for everyone," the update concludes. "The video game industry has a strong legacy of prioritizing player safety, especially for children. At the same time, we recognize that these challenges require collaboration and shared values, and so we welcome others to commit to the safety and well-being of players everywhere."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The topic of safety in gaming experiences has been at the forefront of discussions throughout 2025.
