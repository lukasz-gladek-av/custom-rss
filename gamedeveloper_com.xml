Longtime Halo community members and the Digsite data archaeology archive headed up the effort, which was deemed an undertaking due to "several snags with technology."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the original demo, Master Chief and the UNSC battle the Covenant in the streets of New Mombassa. At the time, it was the first gameplay shown to the public, and introduced several key elements of both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the series itself, such as dual-wielding and the Brute faction. Bungie </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history/">eventually cut</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the section due to limitations on the game's environment size.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A community campaign">A community campaign</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Xbox Wire, the demo was made using an iteration of the Halo engine that no longer exists, and its assets were incompatible with current versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">specifically. Senior franchise writer Ken Peters credited both Digsite's tools and the series' community with "unearthing knowledge to know why Bungie built things the way they did in the demo."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without them," he continued, "we would probably have only had a rather unceremonious drop of raw assets and that was it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was a big driver for Xbox at the time, and was its most-played multiplayer game until the arrival of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gears of War </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for the Xbox 360 two years later.
