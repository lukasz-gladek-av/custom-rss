			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the popular free-to-play action RPG from Canadian developer <strong>Digital Extremes</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/">that's also the MMO model that other MMO developers should be looking to</a>), is rounding out its list of available platforms by finally arriving on <strong>Android mobile devices</strong> today. That said, it's a Canada-exclusive release today, and for the coming week, before it arrives on Android devices globally on <strong>February 18, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>With Warframe being one of the most successful live-service titles to come out of Canada that's currently active, this first week of exclusivity is a way for Digital Extremes to prioritize its Canadian players and give them the first crack at a new platform before it comes to Android devices and the Google Play Store everywhere else.</p>



<p>It'll feature full crossplay support between Android, iOS, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 devices (<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-and-it-will-look-and-run-great/">when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2, that is</a>). It'll also feature full cross-platform save support, so you'll be able to pick up on Android wherever you left off on a different device.</p>



<p>As for the game's technical requirements, you'll need an Android device running <strong>64-bit Android OS 12.0 or higher on an ARM64 processo</strong>r, with a minimum of <strong>4GB of RAM</strong>.</p>



<p>If you have a device ready to go that meets all of those requirements, then you'll also be treated to Android-exclusive rewards by getting the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong> if you sign in on Android before <strong>March 4, 2026.</strong> You'll get a special weapon and armour cosmetics, as well as resource boosters to help kick-start your time on Android.</p>



<p>This past December, Digital Extremes released yet another major expansion for Warframe, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/">The Old Peace</a></strong>, which introduced a new narrative chapter in Warframe's storyline. For more on Warframe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/">check out Wccftech's interview with veteran developer <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, and find out why he has such high praise for the game. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ArcheAge Chronicles Still Slated for Q4 2026, While Chrono Odyssey Gets Pushed to Q1 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-still-slated-q4-2026-chrono-odyssey-q1-2027/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Korean publisher <strong>Kakao Games</strong> shared its updated release schedule during the Q4 2025 earnings report, including two highly anticipated MMORPGs: <strong>ArcheAge Chronicles</strong> and <strong>Chrono Odyssey</strong>. </p>



<p>Both games have already been delayed; they were originally slated for 2025, but got pushed to 2026. Now, Chrono Odyssey has been moved even further away, to <strong>Q1 2027</strong>, whereas Archeage Chronicles is still holding fast to its <strong>Q4 2026</strong> window. This is slightly surprising, because ArcheAge Chronicles <strong>still hasn't hosted any Closed Beta Tests in Western countries</strong>, yet Kakao Games is confident it will debut globally before the end of this year. </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as <strong>ArcheAge 2</strong> in November 2022. However, developer <strong>XL Games</strong> (a subsidiary of Kakao following the <strong>$100 million acquisition made in February 2020</strong>) <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> nearly two years later that they had decided to <strong>rework the project from a straight MMORPG sequel of the "sandpark" ArcheAge to a more intimate online action RPG experience</strong>. Hence, the title change. XL Games is also attempting to reach a wider global audience by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-trying-to-reach-a-wider-audience-by-focusing-on-pve-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing more on PvE</a></strong> (Player-versus-Environment) content, whereas the previous installment featured prominent large scale PvP features.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-qa-one-of-our-key-goals-for-the-game-is-that-it-feels-as-good-playing-solo-as-it-does-in-a-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong></a> we published last August, XL Games revealed that those territorial conquest features were completely removed from ArcheAge Chronicles because <strong>they didn't translate well to the action combat system and new direction</strong>. PvP is now structured, opt-in, and controlled through formats such as arenas, battlegrounds, and zone-based competitive events. <strong>Trade runs remain, but the scale and mechanics have changed</strong>, although they can still be done solo or with others.</p>



<p><strong>Housing</strong> supports shared spaces and neighborhoods where players can live alongside each other, but the focus shifted from territorial ownership toward personal expression and meaningful community-building, partly to avoid the land rush issues that were common in the first ArcheAge.</p>



<p>Endgame is now <strong>PvE-driven</strong>, focused on exploration, challenge, and meaningful progression. <strong>Instanced PvE experiences are built around teams of two to five players instead of large raid groups</strong>. Endgame includes dungeons with narrative-driven experiences, as well as crafting, trading, life skills, housing, and exploration. Overall, ArcheAge Chronicles aims to respect player time with flexible playstyles that don't feel like a second job, which was admittedly an issue in the previous title.</p>



<p>As for the other MMORPG in Kakao's schedule, Chrono Odyssey, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already hosted a limited-time Steam Closed Beta Test in June</a>. However, its reception was mixed, leading the developer, Chrono Studio, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-revamp-pretty-much-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revamp nearly every aspect of the MMORPG</a></strong>. That's the main reason behind the new delay. <strong>Both games will be released on PC and consoles</strong>, by the way, presumably with cross-play functionality.</p>



<p>In the Kakao Games earnings call, an executive explained the reasons behind the games' long development timelines:</p>



<p><em>Regarding ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey, our overarching approach is to further enhance the completeness of the game build. In the process of conducting the test and going through the optimization process, we wanted to make sure that we fully reflect all the enhancements that is required. So once again, we made certain adjustments because we wanted to further expand on the validating of the development. So through these efforts, basically the timeline has been adjusted so that we could minimize the operational risk as much as possible.</em></p>

			<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">God of War</em> series is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tentpole PlayStation franchises,</strong> and one that represents the <strong>brand's identity best</strong>. Moving from the <strong>character-action experiences</strong> of the first three entries in the series, the franchise starring Kratos has evolved into a compelling <strong>action-adventure series</strong> with the latest two games. Such a drastic departure in gameplay and tone is obviously making fans of the series curious about the <strong>franchise's future</strong>, but as of now, not much is known about how<em> God of War</em> will evolve in future games.</p>



<p>Before a new main entry in the series, however, it is rumored a smaller <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War </strong></a>will be released, possibly to bridge the gap between<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War Ragnarok</strong></a></em> and its sequel. Although there's the chance this game will be revealed during tomorrow's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">State of Play</strong></a>, the game's official announcement may be accompanied by another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">surprising revelation</strong>, judging from what a known insider recently said.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021355822207598991#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a></strong>, insider Nate the Hate, who has an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">excellent track record</strong>, revealing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 announcement date</strong></a> ahead of an official confirmation, among other things, said something interesting about this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em> spin-off.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"All I can say is this: When talk of the 2D God of War first started last year, I heard whispers that it was being considered for a multiplatform release,"</em> the insider said. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if this consideration "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">evolved into an active plan,"</em> so it remains to be seen if this project will become the first entry in the series to enjoy <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a multiplatform release</strong>.</p>



<p>As the insider did not specify what kinds of&nbsp;multiplatform whispers&nbsp;were circulating last year, the safest bet would be on&nbsp;a <strong>simultaneous PlayStation 5 and PC release</strong>, if such plans are still in the works, a strategy that was previously reserved for certain titles, such as the live service game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></strong>. At the same time, considering some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">smaller PlayStation games</strong> did release on other consoles and PC in the past, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO: Horizon Adventures</a></strong>, it wouldn't really be surprising to see the game launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> as well, whose hybrid nature would be well-suited for a Metroidvania game.</p>



<p>Without any official information on this <em>God of War</em> project, however, <strong>a multiplatform release remains pure speculation</strong>. However, if the game is finally shown this week, we won't have to <strong>wait</strong> <strong>much longer</strong> to learn what it's about and whether non-PlayStation players will be able to experience it as well.</p>
