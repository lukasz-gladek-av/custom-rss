			<p>It's been confirmed on the official website for Forza Horizon 5 that this previously Xbox-exclusive title will now be coming to PlayStation 5. This is a huge deal for those who were previously unable to play this game due to it only being on Xbox and PC. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/">rumors were circulating</a> months prior, fans will now be able to dive into this game on PlayStation 5 in the Spring.</p>
<p>Since the game was released, it has received over 40 thematic updates, with two expansions and other content added into the game to keep it fresh for the Forza Horizon fans. Now that it's coming to PlayStation 5, players will have access to the nearly 900 cars available in the game, where they will finally be able to drive along Mexico's roads and experience the Horizon Festival.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news post</a> on the Forza website, it was stated that the PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon 5 was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games. For those who may be worried about missing out on content, fear not. The game will come with all of the same content as the Xbox and PC versions of the title. Additionally, Car Packs and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will be available for PlayStation 5 users to purchase should they want to.</p>
<p>The news post also announced that there will be a special free update being added to the game across all platforms, titled Horizon Realms. Realm will allow players to explore a curated collection of the community's favorite previously released Evolving Worlds. There will also be "some other surprises," with details to be released in the future.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist on the PlayStation Store</a> today, where players will be able to get updates about when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be cross-play for all Forza Horizon 5 players across Xbox consoles, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>With Xbox deciding to do away with console exclusives, it will be interesting to see what further Xbox exclusives are revealed to be making their way over to PlayStation 5 in the future. Whether this means PlayStation will see titles like Halo or Senua's Saga: Hellblade II remains to be seen, but we can only hope they will be ported over in the future.</p>
