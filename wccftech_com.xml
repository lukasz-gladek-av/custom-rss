			<p>Glenn Israel has worked on the Halo franchise for 17 years, joining Bungie back in 2008 when the studio was known for Halo, and stayed with the series by following it to 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) where he has been since. He is no longer working on the series that he spent nearly two decades with, however, as he announced with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">a statement on his LinkedIn</a> that he has left Halo Studios, though the statement leaves plenty of questions as to the circumstances under which he is leaving.</p>



<p>"<em>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe</em>," Israel wrote. "<em>There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year</em>. <em>In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I know that</em> <em>the state of our industry seems dire but never forget that you are free to choose. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong. As always, I'll be here if you need to talk</em>."</p>



<p>As Israel mentions, he'll share more about the details of his departure at some point in 2026, but his statement also seems to suggest he's not leaving amicably.</p>



<p>It's no secret that 343 Industries/Halo Studios has had its struggles in the last few years, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/">key members of the team leaving</a> before Israel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">layoffs and allegations towards parent company Microsoft for the studio's internal issues</a>, and fans turning on the studio for decisions <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">like leaving behind couch co-op on Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-microsotrancation-plans-abandoned/">almost including microtransactions in the Master Chief Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The future of the series has been unclear amidst all of this, particularly since Halo Infinite <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-team-fell-short-on-post-launch-plan-retrenched-now-booty/">didn't exactly hit its mark at launch</a>. As far as what we know is next for the series, Halo Studios has committed to sharing more at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo World Championships taking place later this month on October 24</a>, which could also be where <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">a rumoured remake of Halo Combat Evolved is first revealed</a>.</p>



<p>Whenever Israel is able to share more about his departure, it'll be interesting to see what he touches on and how the changes to the studio and its struggles impacted his decision to leave Halo behind.</p>
