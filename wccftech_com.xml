			<p>German independent developer Shin'en Games announced that The Touryst Deluxe will be released digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on September 25. Pre-orders are already open via the Nintendo eShop at $19.99, and owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Touryst</a> for the original Switch can upgrade for $4.99.</p>



<p>Compared to the original title (which launched in late 2019 for the Switch before making it to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), The Touryst Deluxe will add a new arcade game, new items, new quest, and improved visuals. On the 'docked' or TV mode, it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while handheld mode runs at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. Now, it should be noted that this is by no means a heavy game to run. In fact, it already ran at 4K resolution on the Xbox Series S back in 2020.</p>



<p>Finally, the studio confirmed that users will have the option to import existing save data from The Touryst.</p>

<p>Here's a brief overview of The Touryst, courtesy of the developer:</p>



<p><em>You are just arriving at the Monument Islands. Want to go swimming? Or rather take a dive into the deep sea? Or do you want to visit the amusement arcade, do some shopping, dance at the beach party? Fancy some surfing? Or will you talk with the strange old tourist and listen what he has to say about these ancient mysterious monuments..</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Discover exotic islands and explore ancient monuments</em></li>



<li><em>Climb into deep mines and uncover secret passages</em></li>



<li><em>Make the trip you always wanted and enjoy the tourist life</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Touryst Deluxe will be the second game released by Shin'en for the Nintendo Switch 2 after the launch title <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-nintendo-switch-2-q-new-hd-rumble-is-very-impressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAST FUSION</a>, which also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with HDR support.</p>

			<p>While CD PROJEKT RED is focused mainly on The Witcher IV, work at the new Boston office is already ongoing on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion. As of July 2025, 116 developers were already on the project, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in the pre-production phase</a>. That number is expected to grow steadily, including an intriguing new position for Lead Network Engineer that already has fans guessing at potential online multiplayer modes. Here's the relevant excerpt from the <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job ad</a>:  </p>



<p><em>CD PROJEKT RED is currently seeking a Lead Network Engineer to join our team working on Cyberpunk 2, the next mainline Cyberpunk 2077 game. As a Lead Network Engineer, you and your team will play a pivotal role in designing and implementing the network architecture and online systems. You will lead and manage a team of talented engineers, working collaboratively to ensure seamless and robust online systems.</em></p>



<p><em>We are seeking a candidate with a blend of proven management experience and technical expertise in networking for games.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Design, implement, and maintain scalable and efficient network architectures for online features.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure low-latency, high-performance online experiences for players.</em></li>



<li><em>Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em><strong>Qualifications</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Proven track record of leadership in a senior network engineering role</em></p>



<p>As our readers might recall, Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to receive online multiplayer post-launch. However, just a few months after the game's December 2020 release, CD PROJEKT RED d<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-plan-reconsidered-by-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecided to reconsider its multiplayer strategy</a>, effectively delaying it so that it might be applied to future projects instead. That made sense at the time, especially due to Cyberpunk 2077's launch issues, such as bugs and performance, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>Now, the studio appears to believe it's time to go all-in for the sequel. We never really got any inkling as to how the multiplayer would work in the first game, but given the open world city setting, fans have speculated that it could play not too dissimilar to GTA Online, albeit with its own twists.</p>



<p>Recently, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that Keanu Reeves would love to return as Johnny Silverhand in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Mike Pondsmith, creator of the fictional universe, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that there will be a second city in addition to Night City, and that it will feel like 'Chicago gone wrong'.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that Project Orion is at least four or five years away, if not more. Fans will have to brace for a long wait.</p>

			<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is officially out next week, on September 25, 2025, but that official release date hasn't stopped physical copies of the game from finding their way out into the wild early. While physical copies of a racing game don't exactly mean big narrative spoilers are about to hit the wire the way it would for other titles getting out early, in this case, it does seem to mean the rest of the DLC collaborations SEGA had planned getting leaked early.</p>



<p>A photo of a postcard that came with physical copies of the game, which is stored inside the case, shows the remaining three collaborations that SEGA has yet to announce for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The image was posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1nkh9h8/so_about_the_final_unannounced_collab_dlc/">Sonic the Hedgehog Reddit</a>, revealing that the next three collaborations after the already announced Minecraft, Pac-Man, and Spongebob collaborations are: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar Legends, and Mega Man.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this doesn't necessarily reveal which characters from each of the above series will be included. The <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/racers.html">official website</a> for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds shows eight mystery spots in the roster of DLC characters. Half of those could be filled by the Turtles, but the image specifically lists TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, so we could see other characters beyond the four teenage turtles, and that's before mentioning that there might be a greater focus on including characters from the other three series.</p>



<p>At the very least, we know to expect new tracks, characters, and vehicles related to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Avatar Legends, and Megaman. Also, since this information was featured in a postcard coming with physical copies of the game that will be officially available in just a few days, it's likely we'll hear a proper announcement from SEGA regarding these DLC collaborations soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Wccftech's review</a> of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds from Nathan Birch, who writes, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>
