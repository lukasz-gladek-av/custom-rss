			<p>Ready or Not developer VOID Interactive has fired its long-time Community Manager, nicknamed 'Kaminsky', over their comments on Charlie Kirk's murder.</p>



<p>When asked about adding Charlie Kirk to the official Ready or Not Discord channel's filtered words, Kaminsky replied:</p>



<p><em>I just did Charlie. Funny you mention that because me and my roommate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.</em></p>



<p>Following an outpour of outraged comments at the response, VOID Interactive <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1969054077737668689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> this message to the community:</p>



<p><em>We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event. These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around Ready or Not.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first controversy VOID Interactive has faced. In 2021, the studio announced a partnership with Team17 to publish the game, but the deal was called off only a few months later. Speculation ran rampant that it was due to a school shooting level that the developers had teased via Reddit, but VOID Interactive always denied that there was any kind of link.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2022, Ready or Not was suddenly delisted from Steam due to a takedown request for trademark infringement related to a nightclub level. This was likely due to the in-game name of the nightclub, Pryzm, being the same as an actual chain of nightclubs in the United Kingdom. The game returned to Valve's store two days later.</p>



<p>More recently, the first-person tactical shooter game Ready or Not was featured in the news for its successful console launch. In less than eight weeks, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpassed-3-million-units-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over three million units on consoles. Between PC and consoles, the total amount of copies sold is thirteen million units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday afternoon, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">quietly announced</a> that it would be raising the price for its Xbox Series X/S consoles in the United States, with the Series X getting a $50 increase, the 2TB Series X getting a $70 increase, and the Series S getting a $20 increase starting October 3. It's the second price jump for the Xbox console line this year, meaning that when we finally get to Oct.3, in the US alone, the Series S will have gone up $100, the Series X $150, and the 2TB Series X variant will have jumped up $200 in price.</p>



<p>Many have been quick to point to the current US administration's new tariffs as the real reason behind these price jumps, or as Microsoft puts it, "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." According to former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, however, that's only part of the story.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ybarra plainly states, "<em>Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues</em>. <em>And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He further clarifies that he's pointing out that the tariffs only account for one price increase. This second jump in price "<em>is simply a different problem and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems</em>," while tariffs remain "<em>an excuse to continue raising prices</em>."</p>



<p>The tariffs introduced this year are undoubtedly part of the price increases on hardware from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox. But Ybarra isn't exactly wrong to point out that Microsoft raising its prices a second time, and the struggles it faces when competing with PlayStation and Nintendo go deeper and started well before this year's tariffs came into the equation.</p>
