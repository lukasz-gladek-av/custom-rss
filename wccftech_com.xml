			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-2042-update-battlefield-6-beta-end/">Battlefield 6</a> has had its open beta, and now it's Call of Duty's turn, as the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cross-gen-bundle/9plbm5790l94">official store page on Xbox website</a> confirms that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will have an open beta that will be live for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on October 2, 2025, and for everyone else on October 5. The description doesn't say how long the beta will last, or if there will be a second weekend, but further down in the description it does say that "<em>Open Beta duration is 2 days</em>" at a minimum.</p>



<p>That said, we'll likely have much more information on the beta and on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in general after Gamescom ONL 2025 today, which is kicking off in just a little more than an hour at the time of this writing. The game's full reveal is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-gamescom/">set to kick off the showcase</a> today, and it's a good bet that we'll hear more specifics about the open beta, and get a confirmation of the game's release date that seems to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/">already leaked just last week</a>. </p>



<p>Though the store page does potentially confirm the release date, since it says that the Reznov Challenge Pack that can be unlocked in Black Ops 6 "<em>Must be redeemed by November 14, 2025</em>."</p>







<p>What's interesting about these open beta dates, and the leaked release date, is that it means Black Ops 7 will be having its beta right around the time Battlefield 6 is launching, and if the leaked release date is correct, Battlefield 6 will have had a full month to build an audience and potential lead on Call of Duty before its even out on store shelves.</p>



<p>There's been a lot of talk about what the bout between both shooters will look like this year, with some thinking that <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">EA has the chance to take a win over Activision</a>, though others are less convinced, even while admitting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-potential-to-do-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-600k-steam-pre-orders/">Battlefield 6 is looking like it'll be a tentpole entry for the series</a>.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has the strength of its annual releases and years of community built behind it, so it's definitely unlikely that Battlefield 6 will be able to go toe-to-toe with it Black Ops 7 on the sales charts. But it can certainly try, and for shooter fans, it's exciting to see both series back in fighting shape after years of Call of Duty dominance. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Cloud Chamber, the studio that's working on the next game in the BioShock series that we currently know as BioShock 4, is laying off some of its staff, and former general manager of the Diablo franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/">Rod Fergusson</a>, will be taking over as Cloud Chamber's studio head.</p>



<p>Schreier shared the news in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">quick post on Bluesky</a>, and also pointed out that Fergusson is seemingly finding himself in a similar position compared to the last time he worked on the BioShock series, since he was brought in at the eleventh hour to help cobble together BioShock Infinite when it was facing development struggles.</p>



<p>This report also follows Schreier's reporting from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/">beginning of August</a>, when he shared that the game was in development turmoil and had undergone major leadership changes after it failed a milestone check-in with Take-Two.</p>







<p>Fergusson is taking over for Kelley Gilmore, who was removed from her role as studio head and pushed into a position on the publishing side of things earlier this month. It's unclear how much of the team Cloud Chamber is losing, but all these changes, save for Fergusson coming in, don't exactly spell good things to come for BioShock 4's development.</p>



<p>At least Fergusson has the chance to be a bright light for Cloud Chamber. He has a reputation for being able to save projects stuck in development hell, after famously doing it for BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo IV. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Fergusson shared the news that he'd be returning to the series as the new head of BioShock at 2K, saying that it's a meaningful moment for him because BioShock is a series that "<em>means a lot</em>" to him, but understands that he's coming in at a difficult time.</p>



<p>"<em>While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team. I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,</em>" Fergusson wrote.</p>

<p>BioShock 4 has been in the works in one way or another <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">since approximately 2015</a>, and with no near end in sight for what's clearly been a marred development period, there's now a bit of hope for the game's future. Right now, it seems like if anyone can fix the issues it is having, Rod Fergusson is the one to do it.</p>



<p>Let's hope he can keep earning his reputation as a 'closer' to troubled projects, with the help of the rest of the remaining team at Cloud Chamber.</p>
