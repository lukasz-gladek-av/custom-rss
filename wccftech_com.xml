			<p>Developer Raccoon Logic's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> has surpassed 1 million players, the studio has announced. Nearly two weeks since the game launched, the studio celebrated the milestone, though creative director Alex Hutchinson still lamented the fact that, due to Revenge of the Savage Planet being available on subscription services, 1 million players doesn't mean 1 million sales.</p>
<p>"<em>We are super grateful to all the 1M players who have taken up revenge against Alta</em>," a statement from Raccoon Logic on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2787320/view/537728173036537047">Steam page</a> began.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for the support. On the team side, we are continuing to make fixes very regularly to ensure that everyone has the best experience possible. We're also working on a roadmap for new features/updates/etc that we want to share with you very soon! In the meantime, keep kicking brainards, raccoons, and decking out your habitat STV Cribs Style. The team loves seeing all your creations, gifs, memes, etc. Keep em' coming!</em>"</p>

<p>On X, creative director Alex Hutchinson still celebrated the milestone, but seemingly with an upset tone that the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass means it doesn't exactly reflect the financial success that 1 million players would have meant in the days before subscription services like Game Pass.</p>
<p>"<em>In the modern world it sadly doesn't mean sales with the subscription services but still an awesome milestone</em>," Hutchinson<a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1924124703427371070"> wrote on X</a> while sharing a photo celebrating 1 million players.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">review of Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, we praised the game's style and its humor, but still found it a tedious journey that cut any momentum it was starting to build at various points in the game.</p>
<p>"<em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down</em>."</p>
