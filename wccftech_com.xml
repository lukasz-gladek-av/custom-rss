			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> announced a flurry of showcase events, one for each of its major titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/"><strong>World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone</strong>, and <strong>Diablo IV</strong></a>. The World of Warcraft showcase happened at the end of last week, with Blizzard digging into its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft roadmap for 2026</a></strong>. Today, it followed up with the <strong>Overwatch Spotlight,</strong> announcing <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">what to expect for the coming year</a>, and a significant change to the game going forward: it's no longer called <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, and will instead just be called '<strong>Overwatch</strong>' once again.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the 35-minute spotlight, Overwatch game director <strong>Aaron Keller</strong> began to explain the decision to drop the '2' from the game's title by saying, "<em>Overwatch is a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This team is focused on continually delivering these great experiences for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>And with that, we realized, Overwatch is a game that transcends any single number. So moving forward,</em> <em><strong>we're dropping the '2,' and continuing simply as Overwatch</strong>.</em>"</p>

<p>It's a tangible change indicating how the team at Blizzard is looking to reinvent and overhaul the game, though that is, of course, coming with more than just a change to the name. The game will introduce <strong>10 new heroes</strong> over the course of 2026, as it kicks off a new, <strong>annual story arc</strong> that will start with a new <strong>Season 1</strong> next week on <strong>February 10, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The opening story event is the <strong>Reign of Talon</strong>, which was introduced with a cinematic at the top of the spotlight, where Vendetta defeated Doomfist to take what was rightfully hers. The story for Reign of Talon will be told through upcoming hero trailers, animated comics, in-game events, map updates and short stories released by the team in the coming year. This is also the new storytelling structure that Blizzard will continue with moving forward.</p>



<p>"<em>For the first time ever, we're telling an annual story with a beginning, middle, and end</em>," said Keller during the Spotlight. "<em>A story that evolves across all six seasons of the year before a new Season 1 launches the next chapter in 2027. This is going to be epic</em>."</p>



<p>Out of the 10 new heroes that'll be joining the game across 2026, <strong>five of them will arrive in Season 1</strong>. Those five heroes are: <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage), </strong>and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support)</strong>. The new season will also make changes to the core roles of the game, with Tank, Damage, and Support heroes now all categorized into sub-classes within their main class role.</p>

<p>Tanks will include <strong>Brusier, Initiator, </strong>and <strong>Stalwart</strong> sub-classes. A Brusier Tank (Mauga, Orisa, Roadhog, Zarya) receives reduced critical damage and gains movement speed when their health is at critical levels. An Initiator Tank (D.Va, Doomfist, Winston, Wrecking Ball) reclaims some of its health while staying airborne. Lastly, a Stalwart Tank (Domina, Hazard, Junker Queen, Ramattra, Reinhardt, Sigma) has reduced knockback and slows.</p>



<p>Damage heroes are split into four sub-classes: <strong>Sharpshooter, Flanker, Specialist,</strong> and <strong>Recon</strong>. Sharpshooters (Ashe, Cassidy, Hanzo, Sojourn, Widowmaker) get their movement ability cooldowns reduced with critical hits. Flankers (Anran, Genji, Reaper, Tracer, Vendetta, Venture) get more health from using a health pack. Specialists (Bastion, Emre, Junkrat, Mei, Solider 76, Symmetra, Torbjorn) get their reload speed briefly increased after a kill, and Recon heroes (Echo, Freja, Pharah, Sombra) will be able to detect enemies through walls after you damage them and they have less than half their health.</p>



<p>Finally, Support heroes are broken into three sub-classes: <strong>Tactician, Medic,</strong> and <strong>Survivor</strong>. Tacticians (Ana, Baptiste, Jetpack Cat, Lucio, Zenyatta) gain excess ultimate charge that carries over even after using their ultimate ability. Medics (Kiriko, Lifeweaver, Mercy, Moira) heal themselves while also healing others with their weapons, and Survivors (Brigitte, Illari, Juna, Mizuki, Wuyang) activate passive health regeneration when using their movement abilities.</p>



<p>Season 1 will also introduce a new Conquest Meta Event, where players take sides fighting for either Overwatch or Talon, completing missions that tie into the lore of the game, with the rewards from the event going to whichever side was able to complete more missions. You'll be able to switch sides after completing your current faction's weekly pass.</p>



<p>The UI/UX overhaul is the other major change that'll be introduced with Season 1, with Blizzard hoping the new look will "<em>restore some personality and hero-centric vibes while in-game</em>."</p>

<p>Lastly, the new season will also include new mythic skins, <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-6-kicks-off-today-bringing-new-skins-signature-special-moves-as-emotes-and-more/">collaborations,</a> and other cosmetics, with the first collaboration of 2026 bringing <strong>Hello Kitty</strong> into Overwatch. As for when Season 2 will kick off, the roadmap shared for the year has its arrival pinned for somewhere during <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, with a new hero to be introduced, the arrival of the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>version, and likely more than a few celebratory events planned around the <strong>10-year anniversary</strong> of Overwatch.</p>

<p>The next major showcase event coming from Blizzard is all about Hearthstone, which will premiere at the end of this week on <strong>February 9, 2026,</strong> at <strong>9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm BT</strong>.</p>
