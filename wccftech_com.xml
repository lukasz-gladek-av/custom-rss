			<p>A new PlayStation event like a Showcase or State of Play could be coming soon, judging from what a very reliable leaker revealed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, billbil-kun, who proved to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that a lot of PlayStation content is being prepared behind the scenes, and some new announcements are coming, although the insider cannot say if an event is indeed coming. Seeing as there's a lot of content being prepared, it is unlikely it is just for this year's upcoming The Game Awards show, so something could indeed be brewing outside of single, separate announcements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðŸ‘€<br>
A PlayStation event is really happening soon?</p>
<p>I don't have the answer, but many PlayStation stuff are being prepared behind the scenes,</p>
<p>Some fresh news are coming,<br>
Stay tuned... <a href="https://t.co/IrLUZjgLTl">pic.twitter.com/IrLUZjgLTl</a></p>
<p>â€” billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1860979631148396721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been a very long time since the latest proper PlayStation Showcase, as Sony opted to go with usually smaller State of Play presentations for a while. A September showcase to present the PlayStation 5 Pro was long rumored, but it never happened as Sony presented the console without the big presentation many expected to see.</p>
<p>Besides working on games coming in the next year and beyond, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Sony seems to be quite active on the hardware front as well, developing not only the PlayStation 6, which will once again be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, but apparently also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">PlayStation 5 handheld system</a> that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. Plans for the release of this system, however, have yet to be finalized, so there's the chance it will never be launched. As the company has somewhat gotten back into the handheld market with the PlayStation Portal after the commercial failure of the PS Vita and Microsoft working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> portable system of its own</a>, it would be surprising for Sony to skip getting fully back into what is becoming more and more a very lucrative space, as highlighted by the many handheld systems that launched on the market after the release of the Steam Deck.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has had to pause issuing the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-windows-11-24h2-download-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Windows 11 24H2</a> update to users who have certain Ubisoft games installed on their PCs as the games become unresponsive. Here's the blurb from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help article</a>:</p>
<p><em>After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games. These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading, or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>â€‹Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em></a><br>
<em>â€‹Assassin's Creed Origins</em><br>
<em>â€‹Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em><br>
<em>â€‹Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
<em>â€‹<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></em><br>
<em>Note: Ubisoft released a temporary mitigation for Star Wars Outlaws to prevent the game from failing and stop responding. You might still experience some performance issues.</em></p>
<p><em>To safeguard your Microsoft Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed. These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel. IT administrators using Windows Update for Business reports can check these issues using the following safeguard IDs: 54437462 and 54580160.</em></p>
<p><em>Important: We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved</em>.</p>
<p>If you are already affected by the issue, the best workaround is simply to close down the game via the Task Manager if it has hung up. Microsoft and Ubisoft are currently working on a solution, and we'll update this story once it becomes available.</p>

			<p>Sony is reportedly in the initial stages of developing a new PlayStation 5 handheld console that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. The surprising news comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, which cites anonymous sources and also clarifies that the plans have not been finalized. The console may not even ever make it to the market. This puts it roughly on par with what we know about Microsoft's Xbox handheld. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it is being made but also added it is years away.</p>
<p>Sony has a long history of making PlayStation handhelds, of course. The first one they produced was the PlayStation Portable, colloquially known as PSP, which launched between late 2004 and early 2005 across the world as a competitor to the Nintendo DS. The PSP was well received and Sony managed to sell a lot of units (76.4 million units as of 2012, the latest public figure), although not nearly as many as the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>They tried again with the PlayStation Vita, which debuted between late 2011 (Japan) and 2012 (North America and Europe). However, the PS Vita was, by and large, a commercial failure, leading to the decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-stopped-first-party-titles-ps-vita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon</a> first-party game development for the platform in 2015.</p>
<p>Sony kind of revived its handheld tradition with the PlayStation Portal, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this year to seemingly solid sales. However, the Portal is only dedicated to streaming games via cloud. Interestingly, the Bloomberg article reports that was not always the case, as Sony had previously considered making it more like Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> by Moore's Law Is Dead earlier this year suggests that Sony would once again partner with AMD on this new hardware. That report mentioned compatibility with both PS4 and PS5 games, although Bloomberg only mentions that it will be a PlayStation 5 handheld. The latter option seems more likely: considering that the hardware is still a few years away, supporting PlayStation 4 games wouldn't really make sense at that point.</p>
