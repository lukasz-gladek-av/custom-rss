			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally live and available around the globe, and it's clear that players were looking forward to it. Not just because the beta saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands of players on Steam alone</a> (and likely millions when adding consoles to the mix), do nothing but play Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">during the beta period</a>, but because when it launched today, servers immediately hit capacity.</p>



<p>Players were immediately shuffled into a queue system, though thankfully, we've not seen reports of players having to wait a lengthy amount of time to jump in, and the concurrent player count on Steam soared beyond the beta, hitting a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">peak of 747,440 players per SteamDB</a> shortly after launch. At the time of this writing, it remains above 700K and has stayed there since hitting that peak.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 SteamDB charts on launch day, October 10, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even with a queue system kicking in right away, the fact that players aren't waiting extraordinarily long seems to be thanks to the fact that EA and Battlefield Studios were prepared for this. Earlier today the studio warned that a queue system would be implemented to help keep things running smoothly, and so far, it seems to have worked.</p>

The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation exclusive of 2025. Sure, there was also Death Stranding 2, but Kojima's franchise is quite a bit more niche, despite the Hollywood stars, compared to the mainstream appeal attained by Ghost of Yōtei's predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set new PS4 first-party sales records when it launched in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>It's early days still, but the new open-world action/adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions seems to be selling almost as quickly as the previous franchise entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the first sales estimates</a>, despite an unfavorable comparison with the PS4 install base and the COVID-19-induced stay-at-home mandates. The game is also just as great as Tsushima. I dove deeply into my 60-hour experience with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Wccftech's official review</a>, which rated the game 8.8 out of 10. </p>



<p>That was all the more reason to be excited when we learned about the opportunity to interview the actor behind Lord Saito, the iconic main villain of Ghost of Yōtei and leader of the Yōtei Six: Feodor Chin. The American actor has a long track record with videogames (his credits in the industry started all the way with the original World of Warcraft) and was also featured as Lord Adachi in Ghost of Tsushima. Furthermore, Chin has appeared on recent TV shows like Secret Level, Love, Death &amp; Robots, and Marvel Zombies.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Feodor Chin (Photo credit: Diana Ragland)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, Feodor, thank you for being here with us. I've noticed that you have done a lot of work for television as well, TV series and stuff like that, so I wanted to ask you if you'd like to tell us a bit about the differences in your work when you're voicing a character for a game compared to voicing a character for a TV show, for example.</strong></p>



<p>Well, I believe that, regardless of the medium, you know, the approach is always the same, how you approach a character. I think your job as an actor is to serve the writer and to serve the story, and so that's always going to be the same, but I think to me the major difference is that for television or film, the viewer is a largely passive kind of audience, but for video games, the player is an active participant. Because of that, for you as the actor, I think at times it means your performance, while still always grounded in reality, I think it can and even needs to be made dialed up a little bit, because you want to engage the player, and so that to me would be the major difference between acting for television and film and as opposed to a video.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so gaming characters need to be more intense, is that it?</strong></p>



<p>Maybe. I guess intensity might be one way to put it, but I think it's just maybe more actively engaged. Sometimes, you're actually instructing or commanding the player to do something, and so that requires a little more than you might ordinarily put in the delivery.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting. Are you a gamer?</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. I don't know if I'd call myself a gamer, but I do enjoy video games like just about anybody. I think it's mostly because I'm not great at them. You know, my hand-eye coordination has never been fantastic, but I certainly enjoy playing a game or two, but usually on easy difficulty. To me, it's supposed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience. I just don't understand why you would want to have frustration in your relaxing times, but yeah, I do enjoy playing video games for sure.</p>



<p><strong>Specifically regarding the Ghost series, I know that before Ghost of Yōtei, you were also in Ghost of Tsushima, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, that's right.</p>



<p><strong>Did you play either of these games?</strong></p>



<p>I did. Well, Sony was kind enough to give the cast a free download. If you recall, I think that Ghost of Tsushima really came out at maybe the perfect time. It was kind of right at the start of COVID-19, and so everyone was at home. I had nothing but time on my hands, and I must admit that for about a month, I made my wife a Tsushima widow, because I was just playing just all day long for about a month there until I finally finished it. I remember getting to the end and not wanting to kill Khotun Khan because I didn't want the game to end.</p>



<p>It was just a terrific game, and I'm not just saying that cause I was in it. I think it's actually just a really fun game and perfect for the kind of player that I am. Like I said, on easy mode, I just, you know, went around. I really enjoyed the stealth kills, like coming up behind somebody and just slitting their throat.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I think that Ghost of Tsushima really came out at maybe the perfect time. It was kind of right at the start of COVID-19, and so everyone was at home.

I remember getting to the end and not wanting to kill Khotun Khan because I didn't want the game to end.</em> <em>It was just a terrific game, and I'm not just saying that cause I was in it.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yeah, they're great games for sure. With Ghost of Yōtei, you'll have an extra motivation not to finish the game because then you'd have to kill yourself, right?</strong></p>



<p>That's right! *laughs*</p>



<p><strong>Seriously, though, compared to the first game where you played Lord Adachi, Lord Saito is obviously a very different character. Can you go into how you played these roles in the two games?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. Well, certainly with Lord Adachi, he had this great reputation of being the finest swordsman in all of Japan. He was presented as this real badass, and then, you know, no spoilers because it happens immediately, and it's been about five years, but yeah, he just gets killed immediately, and it may be in the most disgraceful way possible.</p>



<p>Certainly, the big difference is that Lord Saito lives for a while longer and has a lot more to do, that's for sure. Aside from that, it's always a great time to play a bad guy, the villain and final boss. As far as acting, you never want to judge a character. True villains never think of themselves as the bad guys. Their motivations and their actions are perfectly justified in their minds, and you just have to figure out what those are for you so you can play them honestly.</p>



<p><strong>For the whole game, Atsu is like, I need to kill Lord Saito, I have to kill this kind of demon that killed my family, but as you say, of course, from his perspective, he was just doing what was right after Atsu's father had left his retinue.</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. I think they really are, Lord Saito and Atsu, kind of two sides of the same coin, because they have similar motivations. They're kind of motivated by revenge and so it's an interesting dichotomy between the two characters.</p>



<p><strong>During the final battle in Ghost of Yotei, </strong><strong>Lord Saito</strong> - <strong>you - even said something like, we are the same.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>I guess the difference is that in the end, Atsu lets go of all that rage.</strong></p>



<p>She does, and I think that's an important lesson. You don't want to be consumed by your need for revenge.</p>



<p><strong>Well said. I also wanted to ask: what was the process for your work like? Did you work remotely or in a studio?</strong></p>



<p>No, that was all in the studio, certainly. We did the cinematics at the Santa Monica studio, a full motion capture session, which is always fun. You get in the suit and you have the props and whatnot, you get to run around. We didn't do any real sword fighting, but there was certainly a little bit of stage fighting kind of stuff, and that's always a good time. And then the video sessions, those were all done in the studio as well.</p>

<p><strong>Was it the same for Ghost of Tsushima before COVID?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, that was also all in person. I wasn't involved with the Ghost of Tsushima DLC (Iki Island). I think maybe that one might have been remote.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. I see that you also have credits for many other games, such as Overwatch 2 and others. Are you looking forward to working on more videogame characters in the future after Ghost of Yōtei?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, always. In particular, I've really grown to enjoy doing motion capture. It's certainly challenging at first, but I think now I really, really enjoy it. Motion capture stretches you as an actor, but yeah, I am always open to more games, especially now that they're so cinematic. They're the new movies, really.</p>



<p><strong>I just have a final question. I guess this is a bit more of a controversial topic, but also very interesting. What do you think about the usage of AI in your line of work? Can it be used somehow, or should it be banned outright?</strong></p>



<p>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings. I certainly don't know enough about the technology to say for certain, but to me, when it comes to games or movies or television or any kind of media, I think what audiences and what gamers want, what they are reacting to is this human connection that they feel either with the voice actors or other players, and that's something that I don't think AI could ever replace because it's other human beings looking for a human connection. That's what it's all about.</p>



<p><strong>AI can mimic a voice pretty well these days, but it definitely doesn't have the range of expressions.</strong></p>



<p>It doesn't have the humanity for sure, and I think that's what really affects people in these performances.</p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. Congratulations on your outstanding performance as Lord Saito and thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally here, and to help you put your best foot forward when jumping into multiplayer matches, I've put together a guide for the best weapons and loadouts for each of its classic four classes.</p>



<p>Of course, not every weapon and variant in this guide will be available to you the moment you load up the game; you'll have to grind some levels for them, but they still work well as loadouts to work towards well before you reach the level cap.</p>



<p>Also, since this guide is meant to focus on early loadouts, when it comes to secondary weapons for each loadout, the only option until you at least reach level 24 will be the P18 pistol. It's not bad, but the actual next-best option is arguably the M45A1, and you won't get that until you reach level 39. So that's why each loadout will feature the P18 for now.</p>



<p>A final note, this guide will stick with weapons that are the signature category of weapons for each class. Of course, you're free to mix and match, but this guide is for anyone wanting to stick within that class's signature traits.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class">Battlefield 6 Guide - Best Early Weapons and Loadouts for Each Class</h2>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Assault loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For Assault players, you'll start out having to use the M433 assault rifle, which honestly isn't a bad place to start. The same goes for the introductory carbine, the M4A1. Both weapons are better for close-range encounters than what I actually recommend for this class, but Battlefield isn't just about fighting in tight corridors. That's why my actual recommendation is the B36A4 assault rifle. It has a lower rate of fire but is better for mid to long-range engagements, and packs just as much of a damage punch.</p>



<p>To make it even better for longer ranges, adding the 2.00x sight will help you see across the larger maps like Liberation Peak and Mirak Valley.</p>



<p>If you want an alternative for closer-range encounters while playing Assault, then stick with the M433, but adding a side 1.00 sight to the B36A4 once you've reached Mastery 6 can help make it more usable in close encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you'll want to take advantage of the Assault classes trait that lets you add a second primary weapon to your loadout. This is where you'll equip the M87A1 shotgun. It's the first shotgun available to you in the game, and having it in one of your gadget slots (whichever is easier for you to swap to on your button layout) is arguably far better than swapping to the P18 if you're running out of ammo in an encounter. Yes, it's really only great for mid to close range encounters, but you'll do more damage per shot than taking the time to reload your assault rifle. </p>



<p>Your other gadget should be set to the M320A1 high-explosive launcher, and for a better ease of use, mounting it to your assault rifle makes swapping to it much faster.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Assault loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: B36A4 Assault Rifle (2.00 sight, mounted launcher)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: M87A1 Shotgun</li>



<li>Gadget 2: M320A1 High Explosive Launcher</li>



<li>Throwable: Frag Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Engineer loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Engineers are arguably one of the most versatile and important classes in Battlefield 6, because they can be a direct response in large-scale battles like Conquest and Breakthrough, and are extremely useful in close-range battles with SMGs as their signature weapons.</p>



<p>The SGX is honestly a really great starting weapon for this class, but you'll want to work your way to the PW5A3 SMG, specifically its Warfighter variant, for a faster reload speed that can make or break close-quarters fights. The PW5A3 is also more versatile for mid-range battles, and since you'll want to be using the Engineer class to take out tanks and other vehicles in those large-scale fights, having a bit more range on your weapon doesn't hurt.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you start out with the MBT-LAW auto-guided launcher, which is by no means a slouch. It's great for doing solid damage to vehicles, particularly tanks, but the time you'll need to ensure you're locked on to a tank can sometimes be what gets you killed before firing. That's why you'll want to work your way up to the RPG-7V2 for a much more versatile and all-around launcher that can do solid damage to vehicles, and blow holes out the side of a building if you need to deal with some enemies behind cover.</p>



<p>Your second gadget can stay as the AV mine, or anti-vehicle mine. It's a great defensive tactic when playing defence on modes like Breakthrough, and deals heavy damage to tanks and ground vehicles.</p>



<p>Here's  a full breakdown of what your Engineer loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: PW5A3 (Warfighter variant, Fast Mag, Double-Port Brake Muzzle, Extended Barrel, Red Laser)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: RPG-7V2</li>



<li>Gadget 2: AV Mine</li>



<li>Throwable: Anti-Vehicle Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Support loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how Engineers are vital to dealing with vehicles, the Support class is vital for keeping your squad alive. Battlefield 6, like other Battlefield games before it, is at its best when you're working together with your squad.</p>



<p>That's why, before we even get to your primary weapon, one of your gadgets that should just be permanently equipped is the Defibrillator. It can damage other players, and revives your own teammates much faster than any other class. Regarding your second gadget, I recommend the GPDIS, the grenade intercept system, since it can be a better deterrent for keeping your squadmates alive under heavy fire than deployable cover.</p>



<p>Onto your primary weapon, you'll want to work towards the RPKM LMG (Carnivore variant). You'll start out with the L110, which again, isn't bad, but LMGs like it take far too long to reload for my tastes. Even though you won't have a sprinting or aiming down-sight penalty when using them with the Support class, the RPKM is the way to go in your early hours because it does more damage and is much faster to reload, making it a more versatile choice.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Support loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: RPKM LMG (Carnivore Variant)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Defibrillator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: GPDIS</li>



<li>Throwable: Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Sledgehammer </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Recon loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the Recon class. For Battlefield 6 players who want to remain on the edges of the fight and take out unsuspecting enemies from range, there are two ways you can approach this class. Either stick with a sniper rifle, though your only option then is M2010 ESR, or swap that for a DRM to fire off shots faster while still being able to see far down range with a stronger scope.</p>



<p>Now, since I said at the top of this guide that I'll be sticking with signature weapons, what I'll recommend here is the M2010 ESR, but I just wanted to note that going with a DRM can make your Recon loadout better suited for smaller-scale battles, if you wanted to go that route.</p>



<p>Regarding the M2010 ESR, it's not going to be the best when you first jump in with it, but what can make all the difference with this sniper rifle are the attachments. For example, if you're setting up in a singular spot to pick off headshots, then equipping the Bipod for your underbarrel attachment helps to keep your aim smooth. If you're going to be picking up and moving, then having the full-angled underbarrel attachment decreases your ADS time and keeps you more mobile.</p>



<p>For your gadgets, you'll want to have your Laser Designator equipped so you can help pick out vehicles and tanks for Engineers and other vehicles to lock onto. You can also pick out locations for players to focus on. Overall, it helps you and your squad see the battlefield better, which is what makes it the preferred choice.</p>



<p>Your second gadget should be the Recon Drone, since it once again helps you and your squad see the battlefield better and spot enemies for you, with the added bonus that you can use it on offence, taking out enemy gadgets through walls.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Recon loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: M2010 ESR Sniper Rifle (Bipod/Full Angled underbarrel, 6.00 scope, Range Finder right accessory)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Laser Designator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: Recon Drone</li>



<li>Throwable: Proximity Detector</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Obviously, your mileage may vary with each of these loadouts, since everyone will have their own preferences. But these are all great options for what's available to you early on in the game, well before you move through the level cap and all the challenges that are required to unlock the full arsenal. </p>



<p>I'll also put together a refreshed version of this guide when we're deeper into the game and looking at a wider range of what's available, but for now, aiming for these loadouts will help you dominate each match.</p>
