			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

<p>Ogu and the Secret Forest from Sinkhole Studio and Moonlab Studio is the other game, along with Deathloop, that's available to redeem from now until next week on <strong>June 12, 2025</strong>, before Two Point Hospital is the following free game players can pick up from <strong>June 12-19.</strong></p>
<p>Deathloop is the most recent release from beloved studio Arkane Lyon, the team behind Dishonored.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">XDefiant</a> is officially offline, after its servers shut down earlier this week. Shortly after the game was shut down, the failed multiplayer shooter's executive producer, Mark Rubin, announced that he would be leaving Ubisoft and the game industry.</p>
<p>Rubin, who worked on the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games and their remasters before leaving Infinity Ward for Ubisoft to make XDefiant, announced his departure on <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786">his personal X account</a>, thanking those who played XDefiant and the former members of the now-shuttered Ubisoft San Francisco who helped build the game along with Rubin.</p>
<p>"<em>It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all of the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game,</em>" Rubin began. "<em>I want to thank everyone who played it and everyone who promoted it whether you were a big content creator or just a fan. Every voice mattered</em>."</p>
<p>At one point, XDefiant looked like it would be the next big hit for Ubisoft. The company was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-has-been-canceled-ubisoft-to-reinvest-in-xdefiant-and-rainbow-six/">investing in it over other projects</a>; it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/">hit huge player milestones in a matter of weeks</a> when it released, and even when there were reports of internal trouble for the game, Rubin was confident in its longevity, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/#comments">with plans being laid for future content beyond the game's initial year</a>.&nbsp;Which made it all the more unfortunate when Rubin's <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763">public statements</a> saying the game wouldn't be shut down so soon were proven to be flat-out wrong.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NoNpmAzGyB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>XDefiant wasn't a perfect game, but regarding why it didn't last, Rubin seems to point to the game having "<em>very little marketing</em>," as a key reason why XDefiant was struggling to grow its player base post-launch.</p>
<p>But it wasn't the only issue that XDefiant faced. "<em>For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that</em>," Rubin wrote. "<em>I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal</em>."</p>
<p>Rubin also highlighted network issues the game had that couldn't be properly fixed due to a lack of resources, and alluded to features that never made it into the game that could've "<em>completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch.</em>" He essentially makes it seem like Ubisoft had XDefiant set up to fail, and then gave up on it before giving it a chance to rise above its issues. Though he adds that those who worked on the game, from its developers to the leadership at Ubisoft headquarters, had their hearts "<em>in the right place.</em>"</p>
<p>He closes out his long statement by announcing his departure from Ubisoft and from the game industry, choosing to spend more time at home and with his family, and that while he won't be making another game, he hopes "<em>that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say</em>."</p>
