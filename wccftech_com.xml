			<p>New Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the next entry in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwAhBxakw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new footage</a>, shown during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, shows Samus Aran as she lands on Planet Viewros and takes on the many challenges she will find on her journey using mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, such as scanning. The new footage also provided a new look at combat, showing Samus fighting against multiple alien creatures.</p>
<p>The new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage also introduced new abilities called Psychic Abilities, which promise to spice up the series' experience considerably. Thanks to these abilities, Samus can operate mechanisms, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams using the power of her mind. The footage doesn't show a lot of these abilities and their usage, but the possibilities look rather intriguing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage didn't confirm the game's release date, which is still scheduled for a generic 2025 release window. With the Nintendo Switch 2 launching this year with full backward compatibility, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game launch alongside the next-generation Nintendo console.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 4 missions from Act 1</li>
<li>All 6 playable characters</li>
<li>Experience core aspects of the game (MIssions, Relationship Building, Town Building</li>
<li>Upgrades, Crafting)</li>
<li>Unlimited playthroughs</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours of gameplay per campaign</li>
<li>Local and remote co-op play</li>
</ul>
<p>GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, both of which were recently reviewed on Wccftech. The other highlight is undoubtedly inZOI, which features the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and ray tracing, both available to GFN Ultimate tier subscribers. The game also marks the debut of the NVIDIA ACE technology through the so-called Smart ZOI NPCs, powered by a 0.5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs exclusively on GeForce RTX hardware. inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches tomorrow in early access</a>.
