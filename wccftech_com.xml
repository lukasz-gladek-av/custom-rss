			<p>Last week, after a long period of silence following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">final piece of DLC</a> for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, during Sony's first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> of 2026, we finally got a small update as to what <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> has been working on. Along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">a remake of the original trilogy</a>, we learned that the studio had teamed up with <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong> to deliver a 2.5D game featuring Kratos titled <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong>.</p>



<p>There have been a lot of rumours circulating for years about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-is-reportedly-considered-for-a-multiplatform-release-day-one-on-pc-or-something-more/">upcoming 2.5D God of War game</a>, so its arrival was both surprising and not; surprising because after hearing nothing but rumours for a while, it was fair to wonder if it was even going to come out at all, and also not because we'd heard so much about it for so long.</p>



<p>Now that it was confirmed and shadow-dropped at the same time, we're starting to see plenty of reactions to the new 2.5D action game, one of which comes from <strong>David Jaffe</strong>, best known as one of the original creators behind the God of War franchise. To say that he's not fond of this new game would be an understatement.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em><strong>This is not God of War</strong></em>," an exasperated Jaffe says in his first of three videos he's now made on the game, the first of which you can see above. "<em>What were they [Sony Santa Monica] thinking, like what the f*** are they thinking?</em>" he continues, as he explains that he doesn't believe the game to be bad overall, calling it "<em>fine</em>," but adds that what he finds offensive in it is how generic the game is, and how he believes this is not the game that God of War fans would have wanted if you were to pitch them the idea of playing a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game in Sony's long-running franchise.</p>



<p>Jaffe adds that he doesn't believe anyone wants to play as "<em>kids</em>" in a God of War video game. "<em>Nobody wants to kids! We don't want to play as Atreus; we don't want a spin-off as Atreus. Why do you guys keep making games about 15-year-old boys? Leave me alone! Go to Epstein's Island or something, whatever the f*** it is, I don't know what they're doing, but leave me the f*** alone! I want to be Kratos motherf*****!"</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though his first video can be described as an emotional rant fueled by only playing one hour of the game, in subsequent videos after playing a little more of Sons of Sparta, he digs further into his problems with it, citing issues of "<em>visual noise</em>" and an overall lack of polish, because while some people might call the probelms he's pointing out to be "<em>minor</em>," for him, not including even these 'minor' issues in the first place is "<em>what it means to make a first-party game</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Jaffe believes players wanted something closer to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-summer-2025-release/">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>,</strong> and <strong>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</strong>. A smooth, ultra-violent, 2.5D action game where players don't play as a younger, prequel-era Kratos, but as the Ghost of Sparta he was before he became the Kratos we know from the Norse-era games. He adds that if you were to "<em>pull God of War</em>," as in remove the well-known IP from the game and present it as a 2.5D action game about a young Spartan, people would not be interested in playing it.</p>



<p>He's also butting up against the studio's shift in priorities to be more driven by storytelling, instead of the action gameplay that drove the original trilogy. </p>



<p>"<em>It [Sons of Sparta] reminds me of a conversation I had with someone that is no longer at Sony Santa Monica, when</em> <em>we were talking about the sequence in God of War Ragnarok that a lot of people complain about, which is where Atreus is going on that long sled, walk, whatever, with that girl he likes and it just goes on and on and on. And I said to this person, 'Why didn't they recognize, didn't focus tests tell them that this was boring and they should maybe cut that or truncate it?'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>And they said to me - and this is one person's opinion, but they would know, they were certainly in the know. They said, 'Sony Santa Monica these days is driven mostly, or primarily, by story</em>.' <em>And I'm like, 'Oh my god.'</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IS Jaffe SALTY About God Of War?!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzruHkjMCfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jaffe also claims that anyone who says he is "<em>salty</em>" is wrong and that his only motive for talking about his displeasure with Sons of Sparta begins and ends with him just not liking the game. A statement that is difficult to take on its face, since Jaffe is primarily a content creator now, and all of these videos about his displeasure with the game are fueling what appears to be his main source of income.</p>

			<p>Over the weekend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">Ubisoft</a></strong> hosted the <strong>Rainbow Six Siege Six Invitationals</strong> tournament in Paris, where it also took the opportunity to reveal what players can expect in <strong>Year 11</strong> of Rainbow Six Siege, starting with <strong>Season 1: Operation Silent Hunt</strong>, which arrives on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> and adds an iconic stealth-action hero to its Operators roster: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/">Metal Gear Solid's</a></strong> own <strong>Solid Snake.</strong></p>



<p>The collaboration between <strong>Konami</strong> and Ubisoft means we can finally have two of the video game industry's most well-known stealth icons work together, between Solid Snake and <strong>Splinter Cell's</strong> protagonist, <strong>Sam Fisher</strong>. Which is exactly what Ubisoft showcases in its Solid Snake reveal trailer, with <strong>David Hayter</strong> returning to voice his iconic character, which you can check out below.</p>



<p>As part of his introduction to the roster, Snake and Fisher will team up in a new infiltration mode 4v4 event where they lead a team of operatives to recover stolen data. Snake's iconic Tactical .45 semi-automatic pistol with its integrated suppressor is also joining the weapons arsenal.</p>

<p>"<em>We're excited to bring the world of Metal Gear Solid series into Rainbow Six Siege with Season 1's new Redacted event, a limited-time 4v4 infiltration mode where Snake and Zero lead a team of elite operators to recover stolen data</em>," said <strong>Joshua Mills</strong>, the recently crowned creative director of Rainbow Six Siege who took over from <strong>Alex Karpazis</strong>, after Karpazis announced he would be moving elsewhere within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>"<em>Players will also discover exclusive skins such as Jackal as Grat Fox and Ash as Meryl, and we're thrilled to have David Hayter lend his iconic voice to Snake's in-game cues. The team also went a step further with 'Last Assignment,' a new mission for Dual Front designed as a special nod to long-time Metal Gear Solid series fans</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of Dual Front, Year 11's Season 1 will be the last season to include Dual Front, with the mode getting removed at the start of Season 2. Season 1 also introduces a new cadence of updates, with the Rainbow Six team now aligning to deliver four balancing updates and two Ranked map rotations per season. </p>



<p>Season 1 also adds a new limited-time mode (LTM) that lets players go one-on-one in a new arcade mode. "<em>This fast-paced duel mode strips Siege down to its fundamentals and offers players the opportunity to challenge friends and random online players alike, or to test their pure mechanical duel skills</em>," Ubisoft writes in a press release.</p>



<p>Looking beyond Season 1, Season 2 will add some Rainbow Six nostalgia for players who remember the series' Vegas era with the arrival of the <strong>Calypso Casino</strong> map, while Season 3 will add a brand-new Defender operator to the roster, and Season 4 is set to introduce a new Social Hub to the game, giving players a space to hang out in-game without trying to shoot at each other.</p>
