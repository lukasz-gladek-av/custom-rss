			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is looking more and more like a massive upgrade over the previous versions of the upscaler, as its Performance preset can deliver better image quality and detail than DLSS 3.8's Quality preset.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, STALKER 2, God of War Ragnarok, and Horizon Forbidden West running at 1440p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Performance preset side by side running with NVIDIA DLSS 3.8 at the Quality preset, highlighting how the new version of the upscaler delivers impressive image quality and detail despite upscaling from a lower base resolution. In some cases, the results are truly remarkable, such as in God of War Ragnarok at the 7:10 mark, where the finer details on the Draupnir Spear look quite sharp, compared to DLSS 3.8 at the Quality preset.</p>

<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution is capable of delivering much better image quality than previous versions of the upscaler thanks to the new Transformer model, which will be supported by every NVIDIA RTX GPU. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, on the other hand, will only be supported by RTX 50 series card, promising to boost performance considerably even in demanding scenarios, as seen earlier this month in Cyberpunk 2077, which can run at above <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">120 FPS on an RTX 5080 at 4K resolution with path tracing</a> using the soon-to-be-launched new Frame Generation tech.</p>
<p>More information on NVIDIA DLSS 4 can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>A new update has been announced for No Man's Sky, with this major update being titled Worlds Part II. Already 2025 is off to a great start for the team over at Hello Games, as they've continued to work on No Man's Sky for the ninth year in a row. The game has come incredibly far since its rocky release, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/">initially wasn't received well by the players at all</a>, and has quickly become a fan favorite for those who like galactic exploration. Hello Games has assured that they are still continuing to work hard on Light No Fire, but wanted to make sure to continue showing love to No Man's Sky at the same time. Below will be the trailer for the new update that you can watch, explaining the new update for the title while we break down some of the new features being added in this expansive update.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lG2DTjP-_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep dive video</a> has been released which you can find linked here.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part II Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75bfyy-XkQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The universe has grown even bigger than it already was, with tons of new solar systems and a multitude of planets that you can explore, all with new biomes and terrain that you can explore. Terrain has received a major overhaul, with it being more detailed than ever before, with plenty of variety in the forms of mountains, chasms, and water.</p>
<p>One of the most significant features that has been added in this update is the highly requested feature of Gas Giants. These planets are massive, and are ten times bigger than the biggest planets in No Man's Sky. You will be able to see them looming over other planets, with storms raging on the surface. Exploring them will be a huge challenge, as it is meant to be end-game content, but it will still provide an exciting time all around.</p>
<p>Deep sea diving is a new feature in this update, where you'll be able to go even further into the depths than ever before. Not only this, but you'll even find new creatures down in the ocean, such as Giant Squids and Seahorses. These oceans are perilous and can be frightening to explore, as they are only illuminated by the corals in the water.</p>
<p>For a<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full list of all of the features</a> that are being added to No Man's Sky in this gigantic patch, you can check out the patch notes on Hello Games' website, which lists all of the new features and adjustments that have been made to provide a smoother experience to the players.</p>
