			<p>As I’ve been shouting from the rooftops for years now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> is one of the most criminally-underrated Switch exclusives, so I was quite happy when it was revealed it would be one of the first OG Switch titles to get a fancy Switch 2 update. Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World adds both a new layer of polish to the game's presentation and a significant amount of fresh content for Kirby-hungry fans to devour.</p>



<p>So, is the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land a well-rounded meal? Or will it leave a bad taste in your mouth? Float onward for the answer...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I mentioned following my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions">previous brief hands-on time</a> with the upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, the game is the best-looking of the initial batch of Switch 2 updates to my eye. Per Nintendo itself, the game now runs at 1440p, but that resolution seems less dynamic than some other Switch 2 upgrades, as the game simply looks sharper than, say, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on">Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Of course, it could be that the original game’s assets were just more detailed and suited to this kind of upgrade, as it’s one of the most impressive-looking Switch titles. Now, it’s one of the most impressive-looking <em>Switch 2</em> titles – crisp, colorful, and bursting with personality. Oh, and yes, the bump to 60fps is definitely felt. The game was perfectly playable at 30fps, but everything feels just a little nicer at 60fps. I really can't find any fault with this game's technical upgrade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But the visual upgrade is just the beginning. The Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land also comes with what’s essentially a whole new DLC mini-campaign, Star-Crossed World, available any time after completing the original game’s first world. A mysterious meteor crashes to earth, causing an imposing volcanic island to rise from the ocean. On this island, our pink hero comes across the heart-shaped “Star of Darkness,” which seems more than a little ominous, so Kirby sets about rescuing "Starries," who have the power to contain the darkness (these little alien guys are basically this DLC’s version of the original game’s Waddle Dees).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Star-Crossed World campaign tasks players with revisiting several stages from the original game (2 per world, for a total of 12 remixed stages), which are now littered with crystals and “Starryflowers,” which can be broken to reveal new, glowing crystalline pathways. All this crystally stuff also affects the game’s enemies and minibosses, making them a somewhat-stiffer challenge. Additionally, there are a few new “Mouthful Mode” transformations, including a bouncy spring, a wall-climbing gear, and a sign that can be used for fun, slippy-slidy sledding sections. Several classic Mouthful transformations also return and are used in fun and sometimes unique ways.</p>



<p>Now, when I first saw the description and trailers for Star-Crossed World, I would say I was only <em>moderately </em>excited. I figured I'd basically be playing through familiar stages, just a little tougher, a little different. Thankfully, that’s not really the case. For instance, in the Star-Crossed World version of the Abandoned Beach stage things begin as usual, but then, after less than a minute, the sea literally parts, revealing a rainbow-coral-coated ocean floor. What follows is almost an entirely-different level than the one in the original game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case for pretty much all of these remixed “Starry Stages.” Level themes and assets may be reused, but these are essentially completely new stage layouts, and they're just as fun, sometimes <em>moreso</em>, than those in the excellent original game. These stages are also packed with all the usual secrets, including hidden Starries and a whole new set of collectible capsule figurines. You can also tackle a new extra-tough Colosseum run, and as you might expect, there's a daunting final challenge waiting for you once you've completed all the Starry Stages.</p>



<p>Granted, there are some things missing from this DLC. There are no new regular copy abilities or Treasure Road challenge stages here, but then again, this isn't a full sequel. For an extra 20 dollars you're getting a solid 4 to 5 hours of additional content, and those who want to 100 percent everything can always go back for second helpings. </p>

<p><strong>An Early Switch 2 Super Star</strong></p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World launches on August 28. Those who already own the Switch version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

			<p>Despite having been out for well over a year, players are still making some interesting discoveries in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth highlighting the amazing depth of its combat system which is sadly left unexplored due to the game's generally low difficulty level.</p>



<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2052brad">Brad Man</a> shared on YouTube two videos highlighting the hidden properties of Tifa's Overpower ability and Red XIII's Crescent Claws and Reaper Touch. The hidden properties of Overpower, in particular, can completely shake up combat, allowing Tifa and the rest of the party to interrupt and launch in the air even heavier enemies, resulting in a more satisfying experience. As such, it's really weird how the game doesn't provide any information on these mechanics, ultimately ending up reinforcing the wrong idea that some have regarding what is, in my opinion, one of the best combat systems seen in modern role-playing games.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was originally released on PlayStation 5 on February 29 2024, and was ported one year later on PC. Although plenty of mods have been released on PC to improve the experience and introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-requested-feature/">features and mechanics</a> not available in the vanilla version of the game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that's more than worthy experiencing, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. With Final Fantasy VII Remake hitting the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S soon, there's little doubt the rest of the trilogy will eventually make its way onto every modern gaming platform at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Paradox Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that two of the clans available in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Lasombra and Toreador, would be locked behind a day-one DLC, Shadows and Silk (or the purchase of the Premium Edition), it was not hard at all to imagine a community uproar. </p>



<p>That is indeed exactly what happened. After a few days of mulling, it seems like Paradox is willing to make some fixes to that, as reported by Community Manager DebbieElla on the official Discord channel.</p>



<p><em>We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of Launch to reflect this.<br>We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible. In the meantime, please join us tomorrow on Twitch at 17:00 CEST, where we'll be showing off more of the game!</em></p>



<p>We'll have to wait some more time to learn exactly what Paradox plans to do to allow Bloodlines 2 players to select Lasombra or Toreador as Phyre's vampire clan without having to get the $21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC. </p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got my hands on a Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 demo</a> before Gamescom 2025, but there's more content coming from Gamescom itself, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, here's a quote that sums up my first impressions of the game:</p>



<p><em>There was much cause to worry about Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, especially after such a highly anticipated RPG sequel was given to a developer with no prior experience crafting roleplaying games. From the little taste I played, though, I think the folks at The Chinese Room have done well in most regards. It may not turn out to be a spectacular masterpiece like The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring, but I reckon it is likely to be a solid and fun action RPG with a great neo-noir story, at least based on the intriguing premise seen in this demo.</em></p>
