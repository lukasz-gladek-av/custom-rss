			<p>During the just-ended SXSW panel, Hideo Kojima announced the release date of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The sequel to 2019's unique open-world game will be released on June 26 for PlayStation 5. A launch on other platforms like PC and Xbox is all but assured at a later date since Kojima Productions <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now owns the franchise</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement was accompanied by a brand new 10-minute-long trailer, which we have embedded below. The actual pre-orders will go live <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a> starting on March 17, with the standard edition priced at $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced at $79.99.</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom Hologram: Quokka (EARLY UNLOCK)</li>
<li>Battle Skeleton: Silver [Lv1, Lv2, Lv3]</li>
<li>Boost Skeleton: Silver [Lv1, Lv2, Lv3]</li>
<li>Bokka Skeleton: Silver [Lv1, Lv2, Lv3]</li>
</ul>
<p>The Digital Deluxe Edition also gets two days of early access to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and a few more in-game items:</p>
<ul>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach features new characters Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning) and Rainy (played by Shioli Kutsuna). This new trailer also shows off another character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli. Neil has an incredible likeness to Metal Gear's Solid Snake, which Kojima had pointed out a few years back, likely before reaching out to the actor about being involved in this game.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also working on a film adaptation of the first game</a>.</p>
