			<p>During Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMxcCpkI44">Metal Gear Production Hotline presentation</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, we finally got a release date for the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which is due to arrive on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">multiplayer mode was first debuted back in June 2025</a>, ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta's launch this past August. Before its announcement, it wasn't clear if there would be a multiplayer mode in the remake like what was previously included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. When it was revealed, it became clear that the answer to that question was still no; there wasn't going to be a multiplayer mode like what players had in MGS3.</p>



<p>Fox Hunt is markedly different than the old multiplayer mode, a change that, per what Konami said when it was first revealed, came out of a desire to "<em></em><em>broadens the franchise’s core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players</em>."</p>

<p>Granted, it doesn't look like it's a bad change. The mode seems like it'll take good advantage of the stealth mechanics available in Metal Gear Solid Delta. What's perhaps most unfortunate about the coming mode, is that just ahead of MGSD: Snake Eater's launch, Konami <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">confirmed it would not include support for crossplay.</a> </p>



<p>We'll see if that changes in the future, potentially if players continue to ask for it to be added. In the meantime, at least we have a date to look forward to for when we can all try out Fox Hunt.</p>



<p>In other Metal Gear Solid news, Konami put out a survey for Tokyo Game Show 2025 asking players <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">which MGS game they thing should get the remake treatment that MGS3 got with Delta</a>. </p>
