Those who have access to Steam and a suitable PC rig will be able to purchase the game and experience it.

All of this news was announced in the new keynote video released by 505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is set to get a lot of new features and content for those who love the virtual racing experience. This includes an authentic and faithful recreation of Eifel, a region in Germany that surrounds the infamous motorsports complex, NÃ¼rburgring. This open-world map is set to be released in the Summer of 2025, with the specific release date to be announced at a later date. It's been said that it'll be released in stages so that the team has the opportunity to provide continuous updates and new content to the game as it expands and nears its full release date.</p>
<p>The open-world map will also allow players to have an immersive level of interaction with other players, as well as the opportunity to interact with businesses and the option to rent cars or upgrade their vehicles via the aftermarket.</p>
<p>"Assetto Corsa EVO is primarily a love letter to the automotive world and the petrolheads' lifestyle. Our concept of 'open world' is designed to let players enjoy every single car to its fullest, whether on the rack or public roads, experiencing the pure driving pleasure and simply enjoying the ride," said Marco Massarutto.</p>
<p>When Assetto Corsa EVO releases in Early Access on Steam, it will include 20 cars to choose from, as well as five circuits across four Continents. The game is set for a full release in Fall 2025, where the game will have 100 cars by that point and 15 officially licensed circuits at a minimum, with more to come as free updates.</p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is now available to be <a href="https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu81-2BxBWpoO13W1-2FJkr1waHxoUFfDV7yVfDglC2AUHrPfTy32OfPiTktnNCzdGuyzXHLgftEhrCjGAhCCDRfZYLTo-3DYUqS_wgpRUt1ukdaFRZYh9QrZG4eYzWlxCkemZe-2BsgPLtG-2FmybzPL2GfDQWiCWmTUvAuLStlYFGYu0XMbHZPcfwEvPr2K7NvGT5mlTwowLnX9JReq1NCR4DybycmQIAsy2M4nNuO4Rg-2B2rGHPCD-2BJI77VlSgCtzhW0f8QKoXVdP1d9IFabm9M2wfYUvGXScMvvEyU8ujoMJcQEbXhRJLx0AZtMVr8wl1Iiihjtm4i3sdFKYXxWdUuKlJIdEhwwSFUHsqh9bRcqy3IAL8RCvGezk69wUzVNsvpWMYQenOSUMUFshjwKuaW9GbCRJIHmenE4gkJFzddty3MisGm-2FECbQyuUouwXsgp2SAEdUEMojmFz02RKQr3x6xodqVnACAJ7DIEVMVWIyn1LgpsOJEkqj3fVZl2Q4Z1H0WM3cXqFAlTg97hDefk0pun5nV9MJ2XkN2MH-2BCuYah-2F7PJw9D5TSecWuTrDp6P08ue4RYF68mO8GVUCvI9c8bgatnuAQenlM4tMR0bPfXdJlLJj-2Fu5TapoG89w-3D-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam right now</a>.</p>
