            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The full Nintendo Switch 2 system specifications have been detailed today, providing a better idea of what the system may be capable of and revealing some of the limitations developers will have to work around for their games.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">Digital Foundry</a> provided a full run-down of the system specifications for the next-generation Nintendo console, starting with the CPU. The ARM Cortex A7BC runs the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set with cryptography extensions enabled, with no support for 32-bit in the SDK, and features 64K of L1 instruction cache and another 64K for L1 data cache. Each of the eight cores has 256K of L2 cache, sharing 4MB of L3 cache. Like the original Nintendo Switch CPU, not all cores will be available for games, as two will be reserved for running the operating system. In terms of CPU maximum clock speed, the CPU can reach as high as 1.7 GHz, a lot higher than the figures of 1100 MHz for handheld mode and 998 MHz for docked mode. According to Digital Foundry, the max clock speed is a theoretical maximum that could be reached in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, Digital Foundry confirmed the specs leaked before the system was revealed. The console's GPU is built on the Ampere architecture, which powers the RTX 30 series GPU, has 1536 CUDA cores, and runs at 561 MHz in handheld mode and 1007 MHz in docked mode. The GPU can run as high as 1.4 GHz, but it's not clear if developers can push the GPU higher than the values indicated for handheld and docked modes. Additionally, developers won't be able to use all the GPU resources, as some are reserved for the system. The 3.072 TFLOPs figure was also confirmed by Digital Foundry, but it has become somewhat irrelevant to gauge the system's performance. Regarding the console's ray tracing capabilities, the Nintendo Switch 2 is rated for around 10 gigarays per second, 20 in docked mode.</p>
<p>Much like the CPU and the GPU, not all of the Nintendo Switch 2's 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM will be available for games. Besides confirming that the RAM comes with two 6 GB modules and its 102GB/s and 68GB/s bandwidth for docked and handheld modes respectively, Digital Foundry confirmed that 3 GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system, which is a much bigger chunk of RAM reserved for non-gaming functions compared to what was reserved for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Via the system's SDK, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm how the Nintendo Switch 2's custom-made FDE, File Decompression Engine, should allow for faster and more power-efficient decompression, and how VRR is only available for the system's screen, and is not currently supported over HDMI. It was also confirmed how Game Chat may have a certain performance impact on the system, so much so that a tool to test the function without an active session is being provided to developers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support multiple NVIDIA DLSS options—DLAA, 1x, 2x, and 3x options. While details on these options are not available, it is speculated that they could be equivalent to the Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes available on PC.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for select regions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Teams Up With Bad Boys For Life Directors To Make A Riders Republic Film Adaptation]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation.1189116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another video game-to-film adaptation is in the works, and this time it's Ubisoft's open-world extreme-sports multiplayer game Riders Republic being made into a movie, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> reports.</p>
<p>The studio has teamed up with Bad Boys for Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah to direct the project, with Noé Debré signed on to write the script. Ubisoft and Gaumont will develop and produce the film.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/">Riders Republic</a> was a flawed but solid game for anyone who just wanted to jump on a bike and ride down the side of a mountain, hop on a snowboard, or just as quickly jump into several other sports of the extreme variety. It launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riders-republic-fixes-achievements-matchmaking-mass-races/">bunch of issues</a>, like most modern multiplayer games, but what it definitely wasn't known for was its rich characters and story.</p>
<p>Which means that, for now, it's anyone's guess as to what this movie will be about. The only note about what this movie will actually be about in Deadline's report says that the movie will capture the action of the extreme sports "<em>with humor and spectacular stunts on the snow-covered slopes of the Alps</em>."</p>
<p>We've been enjoying a renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations with some standout successes, like HBO's The Last of Us, Amazon's Fallout, the Sonic movies, and the Super Mario Bros. movie. But there have still been some big misses, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-tv-show-is-canceled-but-is-being-shopped-around-while-fallout-ramps-up-season-2-and-earns-emmy-nominations/">Paramount's Halo TV show</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-movie-handed-to-tim-miller-for-reshoots/">Borderlands</a> movie, which both showed that you can't just adapt any video game into a film and walk away with $1 billion.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft hadn't already tried to make a big blockbuster hit out of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-review/">Assassin's Creed</a> years ago, it would definitely have tried that in this current landscape before trying to make a Riders Republic movie. Perhaps casting and the 10 million player base that Deadline's report says Riders Republic has will help make the movie successful. But right now, that feels difficult to imagine.</p>
