			<p>The co-founder of <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive</a> and former chief creative officer at Square Enix,&nbsp; <strong><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Janos Flösser, </span></strong>has started a new studio based in Copenhagen called <a href="https://www.wombogames.com/">Wombo Games</a>. Alongside the new studio announcement, Flösser has also announced the studio's debut project, a new roguge-lite called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">Raiders of Blackveil</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is currently set to arrive on Steam in Early Access sometime this summer, and is described as an "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">action-packed</span></em> <em>rogue-lite</em>" that looks to "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">blend MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot and PVE extraction gameplay to create a deeply strategic game filled with challenging, fun encounters that can be experienced alone or with friends</span></em>," according to a press release.</p>
<p>The setting is a dystopian fantasy world where you'll fight against an evil corporation run by humans named Blackveil. The human part is important because you're part of an animal rebellion against Blackveil, and either on your own or alongside two other animal friends in groups of three, you'll raid and plunder Blackveil in the fight to end the corporation's evil dominance.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Flösser describes Wombo Games as a mixture of industry veterans who have worked on games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex, paired with young, talented developers looking to make their mark on the video game industry.</p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,</em></span>" said Flösser. "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year...</em>"</span></p>

<figure></figure>


<p>With summer just around the corner, hopefully we'll hear more about Raiders of Blackveil soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GeForce NOW users who love roleplaying games have plenty to do this week with the launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-on-april-24th-on-pc-and-consoles-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The games may differ heavily when it comes to RPG design (the former is a classic Western open world action RPG with real-time combat, whereas Clair Obscur is a linear JRPG-inspired turn-based game with some innovative real-time elements). Still, they have a few things in common: they're both powered by Unreal Engine 5, available on Game Pass, and can now be played on NVIDIA's cloud platform if you don't have the required PC hardware.</p>
<p>Both games&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution upscaling</a>, which can be enabled by any GeForce NOW user with a Priority or Ultimate subscription. Oblivion Remastered takes it one step further with DLSS Frame Generation and hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination, both of which can be activated by GFN players with an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>We've covered Oblivion Remastered a lot in the past few days, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is also exciting. Critics have raved about it in their reviews, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging over 90 in the Metacritic scores</a> across all platforms. You'll have to wait a bit longer to read our review, as Wccftech was not provided with an advance code and has only been able to access the game today with everyone else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's the full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions:</p>
<p><em>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game</em><br>
<em>Pass, April 22)</em><br>
<em>● Sunderfolk (New release on Steam, April 23)</em><br>
<em>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, April</em><br>
<em>24)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>

			<p>The NvRTX branch of the impressive Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo sports some advanced features that even the most powerful GPU on the market cannot handle at native 4K resolution properly.</p>
<p>As shown in a new test video shared by Compusemble, advanced features like Mega Geometry, ReSTiR Global Illumination and Path Tracing and more can tank performance at native 4K resolution even on an<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/"> RTX 5090 GPU,</a> the most powerful GPU currently available on the market. In some scenarios, the demo runs at a whopping 13 FPS, proving how gaming hardware still isn't ready for some of the advanced RTX features NVIDIA has been working on. Things get slightly better with NVIDIA DLSS, and it's only in Performance mode that the RTX 5090 can run the demo at above 30 FPS in the same scenario that tanked performance at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah Demo: NvRTX Branch vs Stock UE5 - NvRTX Can Run As Low As 13FPS on 5090 Depending on the Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdbjsO8k8mM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah demo cannot be run at acceptable performance at native 4K resolution, there's no denying that some of the technology is impressive. Among the new features that have yet to be implemented in games is RTX Neural Rendering, which can quickly create a neural representation of thousands of textures to save VRAM and RAM much more than the currently used compression tech. More information on Neural Rendering can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">official website.</a></p>
