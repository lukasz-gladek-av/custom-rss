			<p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda is a developer who needs no introduction for those who have a deep appreciation for Japanese games. His development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, has created some of the most memorable action games ever, such as the No More Heroes series.</p>



<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a>, the Japanese studio is releasing Romeo is a Dead Man, an action game with a very distinct identity that instantly feels familiar to all those who played a game directed by Suda51.</p>



<p>Right after <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">trying out the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, I had the opportunity to sit down with Suda51 to discuss the main inspiration behind the game's wacky story, how swordplay and gunplay will be balanced, the game's level design, and more. You can find our chat below.</p>



<p><span><b><i>NOTE: The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</i></b></span></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man has been called an <em>“ultra‑violent science‑fiction action game.”</em> You are no stranger to gore, but what has inspired you to bring it to a sci-fi setting?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> When I want to make a new game, I always think: <em>"What can I do to make people get interested?"</em> For Romeo is a Dead Man, when I was thinking about the game's introduction and how to make it interesting, I thought of Back to the Future, and the relationship between Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown. The relationship between Romeo and his grandfather Benjamin mirrors their relationship, but with a twist.</p>



<p>I wondered, what would have happened if Marty had died at the start of <em>Back to the Future</em>? I imagined Doc would try to save him — by traveling into the future. That idea inspired the introduction for Romeo is a Dead Man. After this, I started thinking about how things would go on, and the whole game concept grew from this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo Stargazer is a unique protagonist, an FBI agent tracking criminals across space-time. What made you choose an FBI agent as your main character? What does his background bring to the experience?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> In the world of Romeo is a Dead Man, criminals travel between different time periods and parts of the universe, ignoring the laws of space-time to commit all sorts of crimes. If there are space-time criminals and fugitives, there would be space-time police too. And what would these guys be?</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of TV series by Dick Wolf <em>(Law &amp; Order, FBI franchise)</em>, the FBI came to mind, but how could FBI agents become space-time agents? With this question in mind, I came up with the background setting. J. Edgar Hoover, the first head of the FBI, discovers that there are space-time fugitives. He then somehow travels to the past to create this space-time division within the FBI, traveling through space-time to bring these criminals in.</p>



<p>While this background setting isn't in the game, this is how I decided to make Romeo an FBI space-time agent. For the rest of the game, I tried imagining how would a show based on this premise be, and went on from there.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The concept behind Romeo is a Dead man grew out of a "what-if" scenario based on Back to the Future.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo being a dead man is the central hook of the story, but has his peculiar status influenced the experience beyond just the story?</p>



<p>A: Romeo's status as a dead man has influenced combat, for the most part. When he first gets killed at the start of the game and his grandfather Benjamin puts the helmet on him, Romeo is not only saved, but becomes a "hyperfied" human, elevating from being just another dead man to The Dead Man. This also allows him to use all the different weapons and skills he has in the game, much more efficiently than a regular human ever could.</p>



<p>Q: Speaking about weapons, playing the demo, I couldn't help but notice in this small slice of the game how short-range melee weapons seem to be favored over gunplay, which felt effective mostly against flying, hard-to-reach enemies. How is the full game balanced, in this regard? Will the player be able to use any weapon type and still succeed?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> That's a pretty sharp observation. In general, the player is free to use whatever weapon they want, so both melee and ranged weapons can get the job done, but depending on the enemy type, you may want to prefer one type over the other.</p>



<p>However, some bigger enemies and bosses require the player to use both. These enemies have weak points that are difficult to reach with a melee weapon, so the player has to use guns to hit them, and then close in with short range weapons once the opportunity arises. In many ways, the combat experience is built like a loop where you cycle between weapons, and build up resources to use skills.</p>



<p>Generally, Romeo is a Dead Man leans a bit more towards close-up melee fighting, but aside from specific cases, the player can use whatever they find more comfortable to use. It was a consciuous game design from the very beginning.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> From the demo, I noticed the stage felt pretty big, but it was still a closed-off stage. So is the entire game this linear?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> It's completely linear. Maps can get big, but there's no open-world progression whatsoever. We did try an open-world approach, but we got rid of that pretty early on in the development process.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>While it leans more towards close-range fighting, Romeo is a Dead Man allows players to use any weapon type to succeed.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Although the game does feel different, I couldn't help but notice a certain similarity to the No More Heroes. Besides the linearity of Romeo is A Dead Man versus the open-world approach of Travis Touchdown's adventures, what would you say is the most prominent feature that differentiates the games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Besides the different progression, I'd say the setting is the biggest difference. In Romeo is a Dead Man, the keyword is space.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is powered by Unreal Engine 5 like a good number of modern games. Is there anything the engine allowed you to do that couldn't have been done before? Anything that the engine made easier to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> There are a lot of things for sure, but I really can't get into specifics. The technical team would be able to provide deeper information on this, but I'm sure there are a lot of things that the engine made it easier to do.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is your first IP in a very long time, and you are launching a brand new game in a market where most developers rely on established series. Why did you decide to do so? Do you feel launching a new IP nowadays is more challenging than in the past?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The proliferation of sequels and remakes isn't just seen in games but also in movies. Personally, I think this marks the current age, but it won't be like this forever. As time goes on, things will go back to the way they were before, when developers were more interested in creating new games than sequels or remakes.</p>



<p>As a developer, me and Grasshopper, we like creating new original games and working on the series we have done in the past in equal measure. There's a chance we will develop a sequel to any of our series at some point. But we will also continue making new and original games as well.</p>



<p>I personally don't think too much about making a new game or a new entry in our series. I just want to make the kind of games we want to make, regardless if a specific time favors sequels and remakes or new games. This is something that tends to change over time, and doesn't influence what we do too much.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>With its blend of time-bending chaos, quirky humor, and looped combat that rewards both melee and ranged play, Romeo is a Dead Man promises to be a signature Suda51 experience - unpredictable, stylish, and unlike anything else in the action genre today. Players can expect plenty of surprises when it launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 is out on all platforms in a little more than a week from the time of this writing. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">momentum built from its extremely popular open beta</a> and the work the Battlefield Studios put in to develop this new entry into the shooter franchise with Battlefield Labs, for the first time in years, Battlefield will <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">have a chance to really compete</a> with Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Which is why it's not a surprise that, with its latest trailer for Battlefield 6, EA decided to take a direct shot at Activision and Call of Duty. The live-action trailer begins with actor Zac Efron, professional basketball player Jimmy Butler, singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walking along a war-torn New York City bridge, each kitted out based on different classes with Efron geared up for Assault, Butler for Engineer, Wallen for Support and Pimblett for Recon.</p>



<p>As Efron begins to talk, he and the rest of his crew are unceremoniously blown up. Following in their smoke is a squad of more appropriately-dressed looking soldiers, with one asking "<em>Who was that?</em>" followed by a quick, "<em>Doesn't matter, let's move</em>," response.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6: Official Launch Live Action Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The rest of the trailer plays out as a live-action stylized version of a match in Battlefield 6, with the focus back to the coming game, but the entire opening is what takes a shot at Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Little details like Pimblett's weapon being painted in a custom skin with multiple decals on it, Butler's charm dangling from his rocket launcher, and the inclusion of celebrities themselves are all shots at the modern state of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The charm and weapon skin are obviously shots at Call of Duty's monetization, though it's not like EA and Battlefield have much of a leg to stand on there when you can customize your weapons in Battlefield just the same. What has more of a foundation is how each celebrity comes from a different part of entertainment and culture. It's seemingly a shot at how Call of Duty includes celebrity cameos and skins that make Call of Duty look more like Fortnite with its mixing and matching collaborations.</p>



<p>Even the song that plays throughout the trailer, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, by Smashing Pumpkins, is a shot at Activision and Call of Duty, as the Smashing Pumpkins' classic was previously used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5AXoDLf_k">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's marketing campaign</a>.</p>



<p>There's also the timing of the trailer's release, which is just days ahead of Call of Duty Next, where the marketing campaign for Black Ops 7 will go into full gear leading up to its launch in November.</p>



<p>It's a clear Battlefield vs. Call of Duty version of SEGA's 'does what Nintendon't' style marketing, with Battlefield framed as a serious and intense shooter, and Call of Duty as a cosmetic-driven, celebrity endorsement-fueled, and decidedly less-serious alternative.</p>



<p>At a time when Call of Duty is at what seems to be an inflection point for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">its ongoing identity crisis</a>, and following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">news of a Call of Duty movie in the works</a>, the trailer hits all the right points for players, as you can clearly tell from a quick scroll through the comments on the trailer.</p>



<p>While the trailer is all fun and games, the reality of how strongly Battlefield 6 will be able to compete with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is more grim than EA would like. It would be a pretty big shock if Battlefield were able to outsell Call of Duty in any metric, really. Especially considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">how much of a hold the series has over the fans who come back to it</a> year after year.</p>



<p>Hopefully, at the very least, Battlefield 6 can prove to shooter fans that Call of Duty isn't the only major war shooter in town, and that the series is really back this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Mainframe Industries and publisher New Tales announced that Pax Dei, the studio's social sandbox MMORPG, will launch version 1.0 on October 16. The game has been on Steam Early Access since June 18, 2024, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pax-dei-early-access-qa-mainframe-talks-improvements-from-the-wilderness-alpha-monetization-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time we spoke to the development team</a> (we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-ex-ccp-remedy-ceo-the-industry-is-headed-towards-cloud-native-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed Thor Gunnarsson in 2020</a>, when the game still hadn't been fully unveiled).</p>



<p>Over this year and a half of early access development, the game received several updates, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/">Steam user reviews</a> remain at a meager 54% score (Mixed), while recent reviews are even worse with a 38% score. Anyway, Founders will have access to the game starting on October 14, and they also get a free copy of the game to gift to a friend. Everyone will begin on new shards (servers) with new characters upon release, so any progress made during early access will be reset.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pax Dei is available for $29.99 on the official website, Steam, and Epic Games Store, and can be played via GeForce NOW. Starting on October 16, it will be included with the PC Game Pass subscription. The base game comes with two character slots and one month of Premium Membership, which offers +50% Grace on Daily login and Gold Offerings, +50% XP boost, and the exclusive ability to build your own home in the game. Outside of that bundled month, the Premium Membership costs $6.99 a month if you want at least one plot.</p>



<p>Mainframe Industries is already planning other post-launch updates. Verse 5, due this Winter, will introduce Feudal Shrines, which are control points that Clans will fight over. Then, Verse 6 will implement Feudal Alliances, allowing clans to join forces in war and peace. In 2026, the developer plans to further expand other systems, beginning with Grace and the game's economy. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-after-the-show%E2%80%99s-recent-twist.1311793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beyond his appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-peacemaker-fatalities-strategy/">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, Peacemaker has made another videogame appearance by joining the ever-expanding world of Fortnite earlier this month. It was a collaboration with the Peacemaker TV series, currently airing, that's written and directed by DC co-boss James Gunn. However, one of the dance emotes that came with the bundle of Peacemaker-based items has been removed following the release of the series's most recent episode, which unveiled a darker truth to what was sold as an emote dance to kids.</p>



<p><em><strong>Spoiler alert for Peacemaker season two episode six</strong></em></p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-controversial-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-following-big-twist-in-the-tv-shows-latest-episode">Eurogamer</a>, the 'Peaceful Hips' emote was <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">removed from the game while Epic investigated</a> "<em>into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote</em>." Refunds were issued to players who purchased the emote preemptively, assuming that the emote would not be added back into the game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The dance, which you can see in the video below, can seem innocent enough out of context. But the context is what counts, and in context, it's clear why the emote was quickly removed.</p>



<p>That context is that in episode six of Peacemaker's second season, the title character discovers he's in an alternate Nazi-run universe, with the dance, specifically how he moves his arms, imitating a swastika. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.</p><p>“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.” <a href="https://t.co/hwHqOiid1o">pic.twitter.com/hwHqOiid1o</a></p></div>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It seems that James Gunn held back the true meaning of the dance from Epic, and once the truth was revealed during the episode, Epic moved quickly to remove the emote from the game. Gunn even promoted the arrival of Peacemaker in Fortnite in a post on <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554">X (formerly Twitter)</a> that, in hindsight, carried more weight than we could've known at the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Who knows why the dance's meaning wasn't shared before its release in Fortnite. Busy as he is, surely Gunn would have seen updates from Epic as they were creating and animating the dance that would be in the game and available to millions of players, many of them children. It's unclear who at Warner Bros. was aware of this and if anyone at Epic knew what the dance would symbolize. </p>



<p>Gunn must have been aware, to some degree, that Epic would do something about the emote once episode six aired. It could be that this was all meant to be just a publicity stunt, though it'll be curious to see what further implications this stunt has on any future collaborations between Epic and Warner Bros, and if Epic adjusts how it approaches future collaborations with other partners.</p>
