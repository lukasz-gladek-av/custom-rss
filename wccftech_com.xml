			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-last-of-us-multiplayer/">The Last of Us Online</a> was a project that many fans of the series were excited about, since there are still people who, to this day, play the Factions multiplayer mode that launched with the original game in 2013. But Naughty Dog decided it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/">didn't want to be a multiplayer-focused studio, and ended up cancelling the project</a> after years of development work, to the disappointment of fans, and the developers at Naughty Dog who worked on the project and saw its potential.</p>



<p>Including the former game director on the project at Naughty Dog, Vinit Agarwal, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">Game*Spark</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/">VGC</a>), spoke about how one of the reasons he left after a decade with the studio was that he saw "<em>the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer," </em>after his time working on The Last of Us Online and every other project he was on at Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>"<em>My main titles were Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 2</em>. <em>I worked on both multiplayer and single-player.</em> <em>I was mainly in charge of boss battles, and Naughty Dog’s boss battles are generally one-on-one situations. So I wanted players to feel like they were fighting a human player, not an AI, even in single-player. To be more specific, I worked on the final boss in A Thief’s End and the fight between Ellie and Abby in The Last of Us Part II. I used all my knowledge of multiplayer to create the feeling that you were fighting a human. A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer.</em>"</p>



<p>Agarwal has set up a new international studio between the United States and Japan with another Naughty Dog alumnus, writer and former creative director Joe Pettinati, who will be running the US office, while Agarwal will be based in Japan. The official name of the studio has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>This new title, which Agarwal described as "<em>triple-indie</em>," is still early in its development, only being a few months along at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>There’s not much we can say yet, but the new game is a multiplayer game, and we aim to bring the cinematic action we’ve been familiar with from our previous titles to multiplayer</em>," said Agarwal. "<em>We’re already in contact with partners, and we expect to have more information to share in the future</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever Agarwal and Pettinati are working on, it won't look like The Last of Us Online, and it certainly won't feature anything copyrighted by Sony, but it could potentially be the multiplayer game that Factions fans were hoping to play before the official project was shut down. </p>

			<p>Gamescom 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, which also means we're only days away from Gamescom Opening Night Live, the presentation hosted by Geoff Keighley that starts the annual convention every year with a bevy of announcements and trailers for upcoming titles.</p>



<p>While Keighley would never spill all the beans regarding what will be at the showcase, he has highlighted a few of the games that we already know will be there, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-open-levels-capcom-worked-improve-performance/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>We'll also get a look at the upcoming season of the Fallout TV show, which has its second season set to premiere sometime in December 2025, though a specific release date has yet to be announced.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Beyond what Keighley's mentioned here, we also know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be featured at Gamescom 2025, and will potentially, finally, get its release date announced after what's felt like an extremely long wait for any concrete news on the game's release.</p>



<p>Just prior to the publication of this post, a rumor from Billbil-kun at Dealabs surfaced, claiming that Sony will announce a new Inzone headset, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-h9-ii-headset-reveal-at-gamescom-2025-onl/">Inzone H9 II</a>.</p>



<p>Attendees at the convention will also get to go hands-on with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which should also have its release date revealed during the Opening Night Live presentation, as well. Pearl Abyss' <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert will again be at this year's show</a>, after the game was recently delayed out of 2025.</p>



<p>As far as what won't be there, Embark Studios has come out to say that it won't be taking part in the festivities with its upcoming shooter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-another-playtest-before-launch-embark-studios/">ARC Raiders</a>, but beyond that, we'll have to wait and see what doesn't make an appearance during ONL to know who decided to skip out on the event.</p>



<p>You'll be able to watch the approximately two-hour presentation live on YouTube and other major platforms when it premieres on Tuesday, August 19, at 11 am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST.</p>

			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sony-inzone-h9-ii-une-nouvelle-version-du-casque-gaming-sans-fil-arrive-bientot-60393">Billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, Sony is set to reveal a new headset in its Inzone lineup of accessories at Gamescom 2025, with the Inzone H9 II, the successor to 2022's Inzone H9, potentially being announced during Gamescom 2025's ONL Showcase.</p>



<p>The Inzone line of accessories was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-monitors-headsets-accessories-evo-2022/">first launched in 2022,</a> with Sony releasing headphones and monitors and then showcasing them during EVO 2022. We've already had a follow-up release of monitors, with Sony releasing OLED variants of its Inzone monitor line.</p>



<p>Dealabs also includes a spec chart for the new rumored H9 II headphones, which shows a few significant changes like the new model having a detachable mic, support for the latest Bluetooth standard, and weighing far less than the original H9 headphones.</p>

<p>As far as price is concerned, Dealabs reports that the H9 II headphones will set you back <strong>€349.99</strong>, with pre-orders set to go live when its revealed during Gamescom ONL. Dealabs doesn't include a specific release date prediction, but does suggest that it'll be out sometime in early September.</p>



<p>While it's important to remember that all of this information is, at the time of this writing, not verified and still a rumor, Billbil-kun and Dealabs have built a strong reputation for accurately reporting retail information ahead of official announcements.</p>



<p>We'll know by this time next week if their reputation continues to be just as strong.</p>
