			<p>Among the many mechanics featured in Assassin's Creed Shadows that give you the chance to engage in activities other than sneaking around and going after assassination targets are the Hideout building and management mechanics, which allow Naoe and Yasuke to improve the League's main base of operations with new facilities that can help their war against the Shinbakufu quite a bit. To do so, however, you will need a lot of resources other than money, which could be difficult to gather by just following the main story. Considering how many are required to level up the Hideout to the maximum, you will need a solid resource-gathering strategy to maximize your efforts and prevent this side activity from being extremely tedious.</p>

<p>While there isn't a proper farming method for resources, there are some side activities you can complete over and over each season to get a lot of resources in a relatively short amount of time. The first type of this side-activity is <strong>Contracts</strong>, randomly generated short missions that can be accepted for each region of the map every season that yield different types of resources. These missions don't take long to complete as well, so consider clearing as many of them as possible each season to maximize your resource income.</p>

<p>Another excellent method to get resources in Assassin's Creed Shadows quickly involves exploring <strong>enemy camps and strongholds</strong>. Every one of these locations is assigned a random <strong>Wealth level</strong> at the start of each season, and the higher the Wealth, the more resources you can scavenge inside the location. In addition, the vast majority of these locations feature some <strong>big resource caches</strong> hidden inside locked storerooms, which can be tagged for your scouts to collect at the end of the season. At the start of the game, you will need to use 2 scouts to get these resources, but if you level up your Stables to level 2, you will be able to reduce the number of scouts needed to get these resources to 1. As you will need to find a key to open these locked storerooms hiding all the goodies, which is done by using the Observe mechanic and checking the gold icons shown on the interface, completing smaller camps requires considerably less time than clearing the biggest castles, so if you're not also hunting for Legendary Gear, completing the smaller locations is preferred. With the Wealth level getting reset every season, you can also repeat the same camps over and over to farm resources quickly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250324114628_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Given you will need to wait for the end of the season for your scouts to collect tagged resources, and Contracts renew each season, the <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows' resource gathering loop involves completing both the activities</strong> highlighted above to maximize the time you invest gathering resources. Complete Contracts, secure wealth from enemy camps, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/">refill your scouts</a> as needed, continue until the season ends, rinse and repeat, and you will soon sit on a mountain of resources you can use to improve your Hideout and make your time in the game easier and more enjoyable!</p>

			<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 might be nearly at the end of its long and troublesome development cycle. It's been over 20 years since Troika Games released the original game, which, between its lack of polish and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simultaneous release of behemoths</a> like GTA: San Andreas, Counter-Strike: Source, Halo 2, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Half-Life 2, and MGS 3: Snake Eater, couldn't sell enough to keep the developer afloat. However, there was an excellent roleplaying game buried underneath those bugs, and it quickly became a cult classic.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2019. Developer Hardsuit Labs, previously known for Blacklight: Retribution, had successfully pitched a sequel to IP owner Paradox Interactive. The wait wasn't supposed to be long at all, with the game immediately pinned for an early 2020 launch window, and with the original writer Brian Mitsoda onboard, the anticipation was building quickly.</p>
<p>However, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2021, and that was really just the beginning of its troubles. A few months later, Mitsoda <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-loses-creative-director-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the team</a>. The real shocking news came in February 2021, though, when Paradox announced it had lost faith in Hardsuit's capacity to deliver a solid product. As such, the developer was being <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely-as-its-developer-is-being-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>. Later that year, the Paradox CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-almost-cancelled-after-hardsuit-labs-was-taken-off-the-project-paradox-ceo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the game had come close to being canceled, but another studio had successfully delivered a new pitch that kept it alive and kicking.</p>
<p>We had to wait two years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn</a> that the studio was The Chinese Room. The new project's launch window was Fall 2024, which obviously didn't happen. However, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The ESRB has now <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Bloodlines 2, which is a good guarantee it will launch within the next six months at the latest. The rating is Mature (17+), the same as the original; we've posted the regulator's overview below, though beware of slight spoilers.</p>
<p><em>This is an action role-playing game in which players help two vampires regain their memories and their powers to stop an uprising. From a first-person perspective, players explore city streets, investigate murders, interact with characters, and battle vampires in melee-style combat. Players use physical attacks (e.g., claw slashes, kicks, feed/bite attacks) and vampiric powers (e.g., telekinesis, possession) to kill enemy vampires. Players can also employ stealth attacks (e.g., neck snap, feed attack) to kill enemies discreetly. Battles are frenetic, accompanied by impact sounds, realistic gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks can result in close-up sequences of players' character decapitating and/or impaling enemies. A handful of areas depict decapitated corpses in pools of blood; large bloodstains also appear in several environments. The game contains suggestive/sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., "snacking on wh*res,"; “p*ssy musta...real sweet”; and “D*ldo of consequence don't come lubed, does it?”). The word “f**k” is heard in the game.</em></p>
<p>This will be The Chinese Room's first role-playing game, so fans are naturally apprehensive about the outcome. Still, the UK studio has been very forthcoming with details, publishing developer diaries on practically every aspect of the game.

            <title><![CDATA[Minecraft to Get Vibrant Visuals Graphics Update Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon.1142859/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Live stream</a>, Mojang announced the upcoming 'Vibrant Visuals' update that will land soon for the Bedrock Edition of the best-selling game ever.</p>
<p>The developers described it as the studio's vision for what the game should look like when injected with modern graphics features, such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, dynamic shadows, water reflections, and more.</p>
<p>Improvements such as volumetric lighting mean players will see the sun's rays cut across the overworld, with each block casting its own shadow. Light will shine through windows, and you'll be able to see reflections not only in water but also on the surface of metal blocks, while subsurface scattering adds a soft glow to leaves and grass.&nbsp;Mobs and items will also have more glow - spider eyes will be even more menacing in the dark, and torches will cast a glowing path back to your build. This will be particularly striking while in the deep dark.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mojang clarified that Vibrant Visuals is merely a cosmetic update to Minecraft. As such, it won't affect the gameplay mechanics in any way. This means that existing lighting mechanics, such as when enemy mobs are allowed to burn, crop growth, daylight detectors, mob farms, and more will continue to work exactly as before. This is important because it makes it so players in the same realm can all play together, whether they are using Vibrant Visuals or not. During Minecraft Live, Art Director Jasper Boerstra said:</p>
<p><em>Vibrant Visuals is backward compatible with Old Worlds, and it runs locally - so you can play with friends who don't have it enabled.</em></p>
<p>The developers are currently testing Vibrant Visuals on various devices compatible with Bedrock Edition. Soon, this version will be available via beta or preview for users to test. Mojang also said they will eventually port this graphics update to the Java Edition, too.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a powerful PC with GeForce RTX hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft With RTX</a> remains the best way to experience the game from a visual standpoint.</p>
