			<p>Sony and San Diego Studio are bringing MLB The Show to iOS and Android devices with MLB The Show Mobile. Published by Sony and developed by San Diego Studios, it's already available, though only in the Philippines. It's getting a limited regional release to start, and will roll out globally as development on the game expands.</p>



<p>The free-to-play mobile game will be "<em>a new standalone experience built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices</em>," <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">according to the game's website</a>. If you're keen to swing for the fences with MLB The Show Mobile but you don't live in the Philippines, you can sign up on the website to receive an email when it is available in your region.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases a bit of gameplay and the touch-control-optimized user interface. It also shows a bit of the card system, where players will be able to collect cards and create their all-star team, which will also likely be where the game makes its money.</p>

<p>This is the latest mobile venture for Sony, and it's arguably the one that makes the most sense. Baseball lends itself to mobile devices better than other sports and definitely better than some of the other intellectual properties in Sony's portfolio. It's also the latest platform expansion for MLB The Show, which was the first PlayStation exclusive title <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-early-march-2024-mlb-the-show-24-control/">to make the jump over to Xbox </a>after the MLB forced the issue to make it happen. </p>



<p>The limited regional release is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this. It feels like Sony and San Diego Studio are trying to take their time before bringing it elsewhere, like the United States, which is, of course, a significant chunk of the baseball market. Though this could just be a quick test ahead of a global launch that'll <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/">coincide with the release of MLB The Show 26</a>, which will arrive somewhere in its regular window of early 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The millions of players who regularly enjoy Helldivers 2 on PC (sales estimates put Steam owners at between 13 and 21 million) can rejoice, as the game's install size on this platform <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can now be reduced by around 85%</a>. Helldivers 2 previously took roughly 154GB of space from a drive, but Nixxes (the Dutch PC port specialist that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-nixxes-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by Sony in July 2021</a>) helped Arrowhead shrink it down to just 23GB, saving you 131GB of space.</p>



<p>The developers have completed several rounds of internal QA and are rolling this out as a public technical beta. Internal testing shows that, in the worst cases, mission loading times have only increased by a few seconds for the small percentage of players still using mechanical hard disk drives.</p>



<p>Before doing this, Arrowhead measured the number of players actively playing Helldivers 2 on a mechanical HDD. As of last week, it was around 11% of the total. The majority of the loading time in the game is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation occurs in parallel with loading assets from the disk, making it the primary factor in loading time. Critically, testing showed that HDD users are only getting slightly worse mission loading times, in the order of a few seconds in the worst cases. This convinced Arrowhead to go ahead with the public technical beta.</p>



<p>If everything goes well during this testing phase, the developers plan to discontinue the legacy version sometime next year. Those interested in testing the reduced install size can opt in immediately by selecting the game in their Steam library, then navigating to Properties &gt; Beta Participation and selecting prod_slim from the dropdown list.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is by far Sony's most significant live service success. In the span of a month since its launch in February 2024, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-reportedly-sold-way-more-than-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold more than five million units across PC and PlayStation 5</a>, with the former platform accounting for the lion's share. In August 2025, the game launched even on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately performed well over there</a>, too.</p>



<p>The most recent large update is September's Into the Unjust, which introduced new enemies, missions, and Hive Worlds.</p>

			<p>The core survival-horror elements of Resident Evil Requiem have been showcased effectively in recent events (<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/">such as Gamescom 2025</a>), but a crucial part of the experience, combat, has remained unseen until today. Unfortunately, the reveal wasn't accompanied by the confirmation all fans are waiting for: <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">the presence of Leon Kennedy in the game. </a></p>



<p>A few hours ago, new Resident Evil Requiem combat footage started making the rounds online. The short clip was shown in a series' special program which aired in Japan earlier today. This clip showcases a brand-new area and Grace fighting multiple zombies using a handgun in some third-person sequences that are highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As known insider Dusk Golem</a> stressed, having aired on Japanese television, the footage was captured from a censored version of the game, so blood and gore should be as usual in the international version of the game.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing I'll clarify is since this aired on Japanese television, this is 100% the censored Japanese version. RE games get a "censored" version and a "Z-Rated" version released in Japan, things like headshots/dismemberment are always censored in the Japanese non-Z rated versions</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996166803119349812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-the-leon-kennedy-speculation-continues">The Leon Kennedy Speculation Continues</h2>



<p>With the first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage not showing Leon Kennedy in action, the window for such a critical reveal is becoming tighter. </p>



<p>In the previous months, it was speculated that the protagonist of the second and fourth main entries in the series would be the focus of the game's combat elements, and revealing his presence alongside the combat mechanics would have made a lot of sense. Hopes haven't been dashed completely, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">game producer Masato Kumazawa recently addressed the rumors without denying them</a>, though, so there's still a chance the beloved character will be the second protagonist of Resident Evil Requiem alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>



<p>No matter what, there's no denying that Resident Evil Requiem is looking great in the new footage. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">The new entry in the series felt really promising when I tried it out during this year's Gamescom</a>, and I look forward to delving deeper into the darkness when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27.</p>
