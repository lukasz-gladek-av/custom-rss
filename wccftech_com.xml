			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>

			<p>Publisher HyperTrain Digital and developer Ice-Pick Lodge have announced that Pathologic 3 will arrive on PC this coming January 9, 2026, though if you can't wait until then, there's a demo available to check out now as part of October's Steam Next Fest, which kicked off today and runs until October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>If you're worried about Pathologic 3 potentially being delayed, no need, as Ice-Pick Lodge makes it clear that its January release date is as set in stone as can be in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">a post on the game's Steam page</a>. "<em>That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isn’t moving</em>," the studio writes.</p>



<p>Ice-Pick Lodge also debuted a new trailer for Pathologic 3 as part of the demo's arrival and the announcement of its "<em>nailed down, screwed in</em>" release date. This trailer does its best to show the many sides of Pathologic 3, to try and give players an understanding of the game's complexities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The demo is a small slice from the beginning of the game, with Daniil Dankovsky arriving in the City-on-Gorkhon, looking for an immortal man.</p>



<p>Pathologic 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/">announced in October 2024 with a 2025 release window</a>, though today's news reveals that Ice-Pick Lodge will just slightly miss that release window by nine days. It's also not the only game with a Steam Next Fest demo, as you can also find demos for <a href="https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/">games like Ash and Steel</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">Lovecraftian survival horror shooter Beneath</a> during the festival. </p>

			<p>Cloud Imperium Games delivered big news to Star Citizen fans this weekend during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9bXJnkgBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CitizenCon Direct 2025 livestreamed event</a>. The game's third explorable system, Nyx, will launch next month with the Alpha Update 4.4. The system features a hazardous, asteroid-dense environment, the Glacian Belt, with distinctive cold lighting and nebulae. Entry into Nyx will be possible from both the existing star systems: Stanton and Pyro.</p>



<p>According to the backstory developed by CIG, Nyx was initially disregarded by the Empire as unsuitable for terraforming/mining and subsequently became a haven for the revolutionary “People's Alliance.” Levki, its main outpost, mixes frontier spirit with a struggle to survive outside UEE oversight. It returns as a fully explorable social and economic hub, rebuilt with improved interiors, external EVA access, cargo operations, a refinery, a hospital (the Mercy), new markets and shops (Teachers for ships and parts, Cordies for armor, Conscientious Objects for weapons, and Cafe Muse for the social area), and significant visual improvements. While roaming Levki, players will encounter the prominent Anthony Tanaka statue, symbolizing resistance against the oppressive Messer regime.</p>



<p>Two major storylines will be rolled out: Pyro Burn and Science Runner Muk. The latter involves the Empire's regen crisis and the exposure of shady corporate activities, culminating in new missions and mysteries. With the Nyx update, players will also find new mission arcs, such as an urgent investigation of illegal tech and derelict QV Planet Services facilities, featuring combat and narrative branches. The mission structure now includes non-linear missions, social choices (helping NPCs, bugging out, etc.), and persistent replayability. Player exploration will be encouraged to an even greater degree with loot and clues scattered throughout. Moreover, Star Citizen players will fight alien Vanduul ships in the persistent universe for the first time ever, encountering new ship classes like the Vanduul Stinger.</p>



<p>During CitizenCon Direct 2025, CIG also introduced the Genesis group of technologies for planetary and biome generation, shifting from artist-driven placement to physical data-based procedural content (relating to humidity, geology, temperature, seasons, etc.). According to the developers, this change results in much more realistic worlds because terrain, cliffs, biomes, and vegetation are generated following natural criteria, with visible geological logic. This also means instant orbital-to-ground visual authenticity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Citizen | CitizenCon Direct: October 11, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n9bXJnkgBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nyx will also premiere a new resource, medium tiles, which balances high-fidelity detail with scale and rationalizes the placement of rocks, minerals, and obstacles. This is especially relevant for land vehicle operators and miners. CIG shared plans to apply this technology to rework the Stanton and Pyro systems in future patches.</p>



<p>Throughout 2026, Nyx will be expanded further, with more locations, system-specific features, and ongoing incremental updates. New gameplay loops and content will roll out in an episodic fashion, organically shaping narrative and discovery in the new Star Citizen system.</p>



<p>Just in case you were wondering, no, there were no mentions at all of version 1.0. In August, Game Director Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the space simulation game could launch in 2027 or 2028. The single player campaign, Squadron 42, is currently targeting a 2026 release, although Content Director Jared Huckaby candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that, as with any game, there's always a chance of a delay.</p>
