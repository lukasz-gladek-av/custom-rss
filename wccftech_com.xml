<p>Since Warhammer 40,000: Darktide has been out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> for a while, the PS5 version of the game will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-released-a-day-early/">all content</a> and improvements that have been made since the game first launched on PC and will also be enhanced for the PS5 Pro. This means that the game will be coming with DualSense Haptic Feedback and 4K60FPS on the PS5 Pro. The performance mode will see the game run in 60FPS on a 1440 resolution and the game run in 4K30 in quality mode for the original PS5.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide was originally released in November 2022 as a spiritual successor to the Vermintide series. Last year saw the game release on Xbox Series X|S during October. It's quite a surprise that the PlayStation is the last console to see the title released, but the game also went through a lot of hardships during development. The title was first announced in July 2020 during an Xbox Series X|S showcase event, with the game having a planned release in 2021. However, during this time, the COVID-19 pandemic had started, which caused a global shift in how work was tackled, as a lot of companies would now have to hire employees to work remotely or halt production altogether.</p>
<p>During this time, the game experienced several delays, and was then officially released on 30 November, 2022. It was then announced in August 2023 that the game would be released on Xbox before it actually released in October, bringing us to the current day of the game being released in December 2024 for PS5 and also being PS5 Pro enhanced.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is a hefty list of PS5 Pro enhanced games that will be available either when the console launches, or when the game is officially released, and the list is currently over 80+ games.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade received a new update today that introduces support for PlayStation 5 Pro and two new graphic options that take advantage of the console's increased specs and new features to deliver an enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The new update introduces the PS5 Pro's exclusive Pro and Pro Max enhanced graphic options, which allow for enhanced image quality and better performance than on the base model. On X, the developer shared a quick comparison video showcasing how Pro Max mode improves image quality and performance over the base model's Priority Resolution mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðŸ”¶New update details!</p>
<p>ðŸ”¸ Stellar Blade also supports enhanced graphics on PLAYSTATION 5 Pro!<br>
ðŸ”¸ Pro and Pro Max, enhanced graphic options are available on PlayStation 5 Pro.<br>
ðŸ”¸ HFR is available on Pro and Pro Max graphic options.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¸Various other bug fixes.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StellarBlade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StellarBlade</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS5</a>â€¦ <a href="https://t.co/jc9sCLVuV5">pic.twitter.com/jc9sCLVuV5</a></p>
<p>â€” StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Stellar Blade is among the best games released on PlayStation 5 this year. Despite some minor issues, the game developed by Shift Up is an impressive action role-playing game that is worth experiencing by all fans of the genre, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonettaâ€™s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive youâ€™ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered patch is now live for the PC version of the game, fixing select issues and bringing performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>Patch 1.1 focuses on introducing fixes that improve the experience, such as fixes for audio issues for pre-rendered cutscenes, which should now have the same volume as gameplay, a bug that causes disappearing or flickering shadows in Meridian when playing on ultrawide resolutions, HUD markers for objectives not rendering correctly with a custom FOV, Steam Input improvements and more. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2561580/view/4480612432780198115?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official patch notes</a> also mention various user interface, performance, and stability improvements, which, sadly, haven't been detailed in full, as well as the team working on future patches that will further improve the remaster.</p>
<p>Long considered a controversial remaster, given that the original is far from an old game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is a worthwhile upgrade of the PlayStation 4 release, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">greatly enhanced visuals and perfect performance</a> on both PlayStation 5 and PC. While the game doesn't look close in any way to its sequel, Forbidden West, the remaster's visual upgrades go a long way to competently close the gap between the two games.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Arc Line Coming To Early Access November 26]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26.1029804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Dreamate and published by Fulqrum Publishing, New Arc Line is officially announced to be entering the Early Access period as of November 26, 2024. The game originally received a demo during <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a>, a period where a ton of demos are available, as well as games going on sale to showcase new and upcoming games. After receiving a lot of feedback during the demo period of New Arc Line, they have made the decision to opt into the Early Access period.</p>
<p>They've mentioned that they have opted to do this so that they can work closely with the fans to be able to make the full release of New Arc Line a smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone involved. To celebrate the release of New Arc Line being in Early Access, a trailer has been released on YouTube to showcase some of the content that you can expect from the upcoming title. It's only 37 seconds long but shows off some of the main features of the game, including dice rolls, combat, and the expansive SteamPunk world that you'll get to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As addressed in the announcement, the developers and publisher are aware that there will be players who are on edge about New Arc Line going into Early Access, especially as it's a story-driven game. However, in the announcement, it's been confirmed that the initial Early Access launch will "only contain about a quarter of the main storyline." Of course, as they continue development during the Early Access period, there are plans to add in more areas and quests to do, released across multiple content updates leading up to the full release. However, they plan to do it in a way that contributes more to the game's side quests and world-building content rather than giving away the main story too early on.</p>
<p>In addition, they will be using the Early Access period to focus on adding more classes, abilities, and companions that you can explore the world with, as well as making current mechanics in the game as balanced as possible so that when the full game is released, it releases with minimal issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking up New Arc Line while it's in the Early Access period, the game is currently at a significantly reduced price of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$19.99 on Steam</a>, which has been confirmed that they will be increasing later on when the game is more developed.</p>
