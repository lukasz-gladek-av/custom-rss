			<p>Today, Silent Games has made a major announcement about its upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-is-a-challenging-sci-fi-action-rpg-due-next-year-on-pc-and-consoles/">action RPG</a>, Empyreal. This is its debut title, and for the first time, a playable demo will be available during Steam Next Fest. If this sounds like something you want to get in on, Steam Next Fest begins on 24 February and ends on March 3. This is the first time that anyone has had a hands-on experience with Empyreal, allowing the developers to get valuable feedback from those who choose to play the demo.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Empyreal, the developers have also released a Dev Diary, where you can find out a little more about what to expect from Empyreal. In this video, the team talks about where the game takes place and the settings that you can expect to find yourself in, as well as character customization and combat. The video is relatively short, coming in at three minutes long. You can find the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EMPYREAL | Dev Interview Ep.1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-8DwY7Fiyk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Empyreal Steam Next Fest demo, players will be given the opportunity to try out all three weapon archetypes that are in the game, as well as a variety of armor sets and abilities, to show off some of the customization that can be expected. The demo is said to provide a lot of content, as players will also be able to make their way to two significant locations in the game, as well as get a glimpse into the late-game gear.</p>
<p>This late-game gear is considered to be rare loot that can be discovered, but that is all players will get to know until the game releases later on in 2025. At the moment, the game doesn't have a set release date or release window, but it has been said that it will be released this year.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about whether this game is for you, there are some features that may help sway you. First is the memorable cast of characters, where there will be personal questlines for you to undertake. Depending on the choices you make affect what ending you will get for each quest.</p>
<p>As mentioned above regarding the loot system, there will be a wide variety of gear available, where you can collect specific armor sets that give you powerful bonuses if you have all of the pieces. Additionally, you can upgrade and modify the gear you find, which can help you become more powerful as you explore the game.</p>
<p>Empyreal is available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted now on Steam</a> and is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 this year.</p>
