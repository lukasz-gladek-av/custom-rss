			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">Minecraft-like game that was recently resurrected</a> by its original creator, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, and is now due to be out tomorrow on<a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/"> <strong>January 13, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has just hit another milestone in its incredible comeback story, as Collins-Laflamme announces that the development costs for <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> as it builds Hytale in early access have been fully funded for the next two years based on <strong>pre-order sales alone.</strong></p>



<p>The game isn't even out yet in early access, but the community that has built around it since work on the game first started in 2015, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/"> stayed with it after it was acquired by <strong>Riot</strong></a>, only to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">shuttered by Riot and the team disbanded</a>, and then revived within the last few months have shown that they are very excited for Hytale to finally be here.</p>



<p>"<em>Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases</em>," Collins-Laflamme wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). "<em>Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future. Thank you for all the support. <strong>Hytale is saved.</strong> We are almost home.</em>"</p>

<p>The Minecraft-like MMO has been a long time coming, and tomorrow's early access launch not only represents a new chapter for the game and the studio but also an incredible accomplishment for the team to be able to get it out of Riot's hands and across the finish line for release.</p>



<p>Of course, a whole new challenge begins once it is live and in players' hands, but at least the team at Hypixel Studios has the chance to see if they're up for that challenge, instead of the game lying dead in a waste basket of Riot-owned IPs, left wondering if they could have ever made something truly great with Hytale.</p>

			<p>Veteran game developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/">Peter Molyneux</a></strong> made himself a household name as the man credited as the creator of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/">Fable</a></strong> series, is getting set to release his next and potentially final project with <strong>Masters of Albion</strong>, a new god game from his studio 22cans. Molyneux calls the game "<em>the culmination of my life's work</em>," as he and 22cans announce its release date has been set for <strong>April 22, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>It'll arrive exclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">PC through Steam</a>, and 22cans debuted a new trailer for the game today, taking players through a bit of what they can expect from Masters of Albion and showing off plenty of gameplay.</p>

<p>Beyond Fable, you'd recognize Molyneux's name from the likes of Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and perhaps more infamously from the controversial title, Godus. Beyond Molyneux, several other iconic names, all of whom have worked with Molyneux before, worked on Masters of Albion, including BAFTA-winning game developers and artists Russell Shaw, Mark Healey, Iain Wright, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>



<p>"<em>Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life's work,</em>" said Molyneux as part of the game's release date announcement. "<em>A game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable. It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map</em>."</p>



<p>Molyneux's name may be attached to some of gaming's best titles, but he made himself more infamously known after being branded as <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-never-been-seen-mechanic-peter-molyneux-new-project-hype/">someone who over-hypes projects</a> following Godus and Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube?. It's what makes it difficult to get too excited about Masters of Albion, even if today's trailer makes it seem like it will be a fun and creative experience for players.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, we'll see how Molyneux fares in his next, and potentially final, outing as a game developer. Masters of Albion could be his retirement swansong, or the game that brings a poor and lasting stain at the end of his career.</p>
