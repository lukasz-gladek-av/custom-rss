			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the co-founders of Infinity Ward and Respawn Entertainment, and arguably one of the most renowned creators in the video game industry in terms of first-person shooters, as a co-creator of Call of Duty, and as a lead for Apex Legends, and most recently Battlefield, died in a car crash over the weekend in Southern California. </p>



<p>The tragic news comes from <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">an NBCLA report</a>, which outlines that it was a single-car crash that was reported to the authorities at 12:45 pm on Sunday, December 21, 2025, with the vehicle hitting a concrete barrier, trapping the driver in the car as it caught on fire and ejecting the passenger. </p>



<p>Zampella was only 55 years old at the time of his death, and his loss is one that the video game industry will be feeling for years to come. He'd <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/">taken over direction of the Battlefield franchise</a> and had also taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">a major role within EA as one of the company's leads under its EA Entertainment branch</a>, in recent years, though he's mostly known for his time at Infinity Ward, where he was one of the key leads behind the original Modern Warfare series within the Call of Duty franchise.</p>



<p>The news has prompted several developers and industry figures to share some words about Zampella and  the impact he had on the industry and on their lives, and to offer condolences to his family, who are the ones, more than anyone, who will feel his loss the most.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, EA has yet to put out an official statement regarding Zampella's death. We will update this article when that occurs. Our condolences go out to Vince Zampella's family and friends. </p>



<p><strong>Update- 1 12/22/2025:</strong> EA shared a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">Kotaku</a> on the loss of Vince Zampella. It reads, "<em>This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Update - 2 12/22/2025:</strong> NBCLA has updated its original report as more information about the incident has become available to identify Vince Zampella as the driver of the vehicle. The car was reported to be a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS, and a video of the crash was provided to authorities. There is a graphic video circulating on X (formerly Twitter) that has been confirmed to be Zampella and the passenger crashing in his Ferrari, so be warned if that is something you would rather not see on your social media timeline.</p>
