			<p>Following the news that <strong>Bethesda</strong> had acquired the <strong>Fallout</strong> license and would develop <strong>Fallout 3</strong>, the studio, known for the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong> franchise, faced a significant amount of online criticism. In a retrospective article published in the latest issue of <strong>EDGE Magazine</strong> (<a href="https://fave.co/4aXc54h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026, #419</a>), <strong>Angela Browder</strong>, current Studio and Production Director at Bethesda Game Studios, looked back at the controversy and found that, in a way, it freed the team to do what it wanted.</p>



<p><em>There was a section of the Fallout fandom that felt that a team famous for making elves and fantasy games should not be touching this series. It was surprising to us how much hate we got. They were not very happy that we had bought this licence. [...] I wasn’t concerned about what the haters might have thought. When a group of people have already decided that you’re going to fail, it’s actually freeing to some degree.</em></p>



<p>Now that many years have passed, Browder feels the franchise's expansion under the Bethesda banner is there for all to see (despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticism levied against the studio</a> just a few days ago by <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> lead <strong>Chris Avellone</strong>).</p>



<p><em>You look at the amount of fans that Fallout had for 1 and 2, which expanded with 3 and expanded with 4, and now you have a television show. That, to me, is the success of it – all these people who become lifers.</em></p>



<p>Like many Bethesda games at launch, Fallout 3 had a lot of bugs, which Browder and Studio Design Director <strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong> explained with the following statements: </p>



<p><strong>Angela Browder</strong>: <em>We try not to say ‘no’ to the player. If you want to do something weird, you can go for it. And if we’re not saying ‘no’ to the player, why would we say ‘no’ to the staff who are making it? We had a grand vision of this thing, and a very small staff, and we just went. And if something went wrong, we just pivoted.</em></p>



<p><strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong>: <em>We were trying to do so much and we couldn’t really comprehend the complexity of the freedom we were trying to give the player, and how that can screw things up. There’s a human element, too. As it gets deeper into development, people get tired. They make mistakes. And then, when you go to fix bugs, you have to be so careful – you can change a line of text and it blows up some art somewhere.</em></p>



<p>Fallout 3 returned in the news in the last few years following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaster leak</a>. Lately, the rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has expanded to also include Fallout: New Vegas</a>; <strong>apparently, Bethesda is working on remasters for both games</strong>.</p>

			<p>Earlier this month, IO Interactive made more than a few brows rise when it shared <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-unveils-partnership-with-nvidia-official-pc-system-requirements/">the minimum and recommended PC specifications</a></strong> for the highly anticipated <strong><em>007 First Light</em></strong>. The <strong>32GB of RAM recommended for 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second gameplay</strong> was particularly concerning, suggesting potential optimization issues that may have made the game run poorly on many system configurations.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">you won't have to empty your wallet to purchase more RAM</strong> during the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">current memory crisis</a></strong> to run 007 First Light decently at 1080p resolution,</p>



<p><em>"We are providing today an update to the PC system requirements for 007 First Light after the community flagged some inconsistencies in an earlier version of the listing,"</em> the developer wrote on the game's <strong><a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official X profile.</a></strong></p>



<p><em>"After a thorough re-examination and additional testing, <strong>the recommended RAM has been corrected from 32GB to 16GB, VRAM values have been updated, and the minimum CPU line has been fixed</strong>. Additional performance targets will be shared closer to launch,"</em> the developer continued, confirming that the updated specs are now reflected across store pages.</p>
