			<p>Activision and developer Treyarch have proudly <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1861092582257807478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the biggest entry in the already massive franchise one month after its release. That's counting figures like total players, hours played, and total matches. Interestingly, the actual numbers were not shared, but they must be massive, given the IP.</p>
<p>The news is not surprising, given the great <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start</a> in the game's first week. Black Ops 6 also registered new records for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet traffic in the UK</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Xbox players</a> checking out the game, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-games-consumer-spending-up-by-10-after-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove US spending on games up by 10%</a>. Certainly, the fact that this is the first time a new Call of Duty game has launched on Game Pass helped a lot with setting new total player, hour played, and total match records.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received Wccftech's seal of approval from Kai Tatsumoto's review, too. Here's what he had to say about the latest entry in the shooter series:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>
<p>What do you think about the new Call of Duty? Are you enjoying it? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Humanoid Origin, previously known as Humanoid Studios, a Canadian game developer founded years ago by Casey Hudson (former director of the Mass Effect trilogy), has been shut down due to lack of funding. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> today on the game's LinkedIn page:</p>
<p><em>Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down. Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations. We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. </em></p>
<p><em>In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey.</em></p>
<p>The team, which had offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Kelowna, British Columbia, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=humanoid+studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making</a> a multiplatform triple-A sci-fi game, which made perfect sense since Hudson had such experience in the setting. He was also the Game Director of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (which is supposedly getting a remake at some point).</p>
<p><em>At Humanoid Origin, our mission is to deliver magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe &amp; supportive environment.</em></p>
<p>While Hudson's project fell through, there's another big triple-A sci-fi game from former BioWare developers on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, in development at Archetype Entertainment, founded by James Ohlen and Drew Karpyshyn. The game has big Mass Effect vibes, although it has its own twist with the time dilation mechanics that promise great consequences for each choice made by players during their missions.</p>
