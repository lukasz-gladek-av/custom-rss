			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>
