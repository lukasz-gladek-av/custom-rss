			<p>Mafia: The Old Country will challenge rising game prices with an unexpectedly low price tag when it launches in three months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series developed by Hangar 13 will <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/mafia-the-old-country-launching-august-8-2025-debuts-official-gameplay-trailer-and-developer-insights-video">launch</a>, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/">rumored</a>, on August 8th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's Standard Edition, as mentioned above, will challenge the trend of rising prices by launching for only $49.99. The Deluxe Edition, which will include a variety of bonus items - the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories, and the Gatto Nero Pack featuring the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car - as well as digital bonus materials like a digital artbook and original score, will also be reasonably priced at $59.99. The pre-order bonus Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories, and "Lupara" Charm will be available for both editions of the game.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the official release date for Mafia: The Old Country, publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOIg2lFVsJE">a new trailer</a> for the game, which provides a good look at the gameplay, which does away with the open-world mechanics of previous entries in the series in favor of a more linear, story-driven experience. The developers will provide more information on the game later today during a PAX East panel. Once available, both the trailer and the panel can be watched below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass">The Game Business</a> looked back on how Microsoft's decision to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on Xbox Game Pass panned out, and the results are, well, mixed. On the one hand, the decision does seem to have paid off for Xbox overall. On the other hand, it doesn't look like it really did anything for Call of Duty as a game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched, according to player numbers that The Game Business pulled from Ampere Analysis, 33.7 million people were playing Black Ops 6. That's a big, 13 million increase on the previous year's abysmal Modern Warfare 3, and a smaller, but still significant 2.5 million increase from the last strong Call of Duty release with 2022's Modern Warfare 2.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 drove a large spike in Game Pass subscriptions, it had more people playing Call of Duty on Xbox devices and platforms, and even though PlayStation's market share still towers over Xbox's, Call of Duty coming to Game Pass was able to keep team green in the game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and the spike in Game Pass subscribers Call of Duty brought in has definitely helped the service, with an 11% increase in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024's first quarter, according to Circana. Players stuck around to enjoy the rest of what Game Pass has to offer, which is better for Microsoft and the entire Xbox ecosystem.</p>
<p>Those same players who joined Game Pass to play Call of Duty have seemingly not kept playing Call of Duty. The number of players on Call of Duty who were playing on Xbox when Black Ops 6 launched dropped 10%, and the Call of Duty player base has seen a sharp decline compared to the decrease following the launch of previous Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is still a massive game with over 20 million active players, but that player base is currently 20.6 million, according to Ampere Analysis, which sits slightly below the 20.8 million it was back in 2023.</p>
<p>More players than the series' last major release were playing Black Ops 6 when it launched, and months later, Call of Duty has fewer active players than it did two years prior. Adding Call of Duty to Game Pass helped Xbox boost subscribers, but hasn't helped its marquee series substantially grow.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is an Xbox first-party title, so what's good for Xbox is theoretically good for Call of Duty. But Call of Duty is arguably Xbox's most important series now, and it's not exactly the best sign for Xbox that adding its most important series to its core subscription service only helped one of those things grow.</p>

			<p>There can be something strangely unsettling about stop-motion animation, particularly the old-school stuff made before the likes of Wallace &amp; Gromit gave the medium a softer edge. A few games over the years have tapped into that stop-motion aesthetic (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/harold-halibut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's Harold Halibut</a> being a good example) but the new handcrafted horror game The Midnight Walk really leans into the creepiness that sometimes accompanies the art form. The makers of The Midnight Walk, veterans of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fe</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lost-in-random/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random</a>, went the extra mile, constructing actual physical models of all their characters and key props, which were then 3D scanned into the game to give everything that proper tactile look.</p>
<p>Is The Midnight Walk a carefully-constructed horror gem? Or will you want this stop-motion adventure to just... stop? Mosey onward for the answer…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Midnight Walk casts players as a mysterious figure simply known as The Burnt One (a pair of charred arms is all you’ll ever see of yourself) who befriends a cute/creepy living lantern named Potboy and a walking house named… Housy. Together you all set off on a journey along the titular Midnight Walk to reach the top of Moon Mountain, solving various problems and keeping one step ahead of a menagerie of horrors along the way.</p>
<p>Why exactly do you want to climb Moon Mountain? The Midnight Walk is a bit unclear about that and if you’re expecting a tightly-plotted narrative from the game, you’ll likely be disappointed. This game is mostly about vibes. That said, the game does take the FromSoftware approach of filling in various details about the world you're traversing via occasional bits of narration, audio logs, and so on. The game is split into chapters, with each location usually having some sort of dark or tragic backstory. The game manages to deliver a few surprisingly affecting moments while keeping cutscenes and dialogue to a minimum.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately though, what really draws you into the world of The Midnight Walk is the game’s impressive presentation. The various beasties that Midnight Walk developer MoonHood have dreamed up hit that proper balance between charming and eerie, but perhaps the most striking thing about the game are its environments. Each chapter has its own theme of sorts, ranging from a monster-infested swamp, to a snow-blanketed haunted village, to a hand-crafted city overseen by a shambling giant, and some of the vistas within these areas are truly remarkable. The game's sumptuous visuals are elevated by excellent music that strays from the usual horror tropes, with some tracks having a classical or even jazzy feeling. This all works together to create a unique atmosphere and a persistent, but not overwhelming, sense of tension.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, it was sometimes hard to fully assess how well the game was running, as herky-jerky animation is an intentional part of the game’s aesthetic. There were definitely occasions when the game’s framerate seemed to be chugging a bit though. That said, this isn’t exactly a fast-twitch action game so the performance stumbles weren’t a big issue.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, a game can’t get by on vibes and visuals alone, so how does The Midnight Walk actually play? The game gives you a fairly limited selection of abilities – you can command Potboy to interact with various things, which typically involves him lighting stuff on fire, and you can light things up yourself with matches that are strewn fairly liberally throughout levels. These matches can even be shot from a gun you’ll eventually acquire (it’s strictly used for solving puzzles – this game never becomes an FPS). Finally, you can also close your eyes, which may provide audio clues for solving some puzzles, open up paths marked by glowing eyeballs, and freeze or destroy some enemies marked by the same glowing eyes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Midnight Walk uses its limited mechanics in service of some fairly standard puzzles and stealth challenges. The game’s puzzles aren’t terribly complex, but provide just enough difficulty to keep your brain engaged. Stealth sections are also simple, but work well enough, at least early on. Towards the end of the game, things get a bit more complex, with players having to do things like lure enemies onto specific switches in order to progress. At times these challenges can feel a bit too fiddly for their own good.</p>
<p>The Midnight Walk is mostly very linear, although there are times where you have to backtrack a short distance or collect a series of MacGuffns within a somewhat more open area. There’s no map to guide you during these moments, with the game instead offering glowing trails that pop up and direct you where to go. This approach is functional, but you do feel like you’re being guided by the nose. Some sort of map or more elegant solution would have been welcome.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WCCFmidnightwalk6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Really, The Midnight Walk feels the best when it’s at its least “game-y.” When you’re simply exploring and experiencing this haunting world. The stricter stealth sections, while generally okay, and sometimes even good, don’t stand out as unique in the same way the game’s world does. It should also be mentioned that The Midnight Walk can be played in VR, and I suspect it will work quite well as a VR experience (I only played the game the standard way on a TV). That said, I could also see some of the more fiddly moments I mentioned previously being a bit frustrating in VR.</p>

<p>The Midnight Walk isn’t necessarily cheap for an indie, coming in at $40, but it provides a decent workout with its story taking around 5 or 6 hours to complete. Meanwhile, alternate endings and a variety of collectibles may give you a reason to tackle the game again. I thought this walk felt substantial enough, but your mileage may vary.</p>

						<section>
				<p>The Midnight Walk is a real eye-catcher, offering one of the most distinctive and visually-arresting worlds yet seen in a horror game. As with most good walks, the experience is often best in its quieter moments, as the game’s puzzles and stealth sections range from good to sometimes merely adequate. That said, The Midnight Walk never strays too far off path and those in the mood for something spooky ought to enjoy the journey.</p>

			<p>While the wide adoption of the Nintendo Switch 2 system is the priority for Nintendo, the Japanese company may increase the system's price depending on the tariffs.</p>
<p>Following the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">financial report</a> for the previous fiscal year, as reported by <a href="https://news-yahoo-co-jp.translate.goog/articles/156ec83309b814db7f93f8b0c00d1aeaae278ac0?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Yahoo Japan</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa highlighted how the company's priority regarding the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 is to quickly make the system popular, and, as such, there will be an increase in advertising and promotion expenses for the company which contributes, alongside the system's low profit margins, to an estimated operating profit increase of only 13%. According to Furukawa-san, a profit increase will require an increase in software purchased per hardware unit, which may not be that difficult to achieve, considering the solid launch lineup.</p>
<p>If the company's plans for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch are clear, the future seems more uncertain, primarily due to the tariffs imposed by the United States, which have influenced the forecast for the fiscal year, based on the condition that they remain the same. Tariffs are considered a cost when determining the price of the system in any country or region, Furukawa-san said, and if the tariffs change significantly over the current assumptions, the system's price could be increased after evaluating various factors.</p>
<p>In previous console generations, consoles getting cheaper was a pretty safe assumption, but the current console generation has shown how times have profoundly changed. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Xbox Series X</a> now being more expensive than at launch in most of the world, it really wouldn't be surprising to see the Nintendo Switch 2 see a price increase after its launch window has passed, and Nintendo fulfilled its goal of making the system as popular as possible in that timeframe. If you're still on the fence regarding the new system, you can check out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on preview</a> to see what it has to offer, and if it could be a worthy investment when it launches on June 5th.</p>
