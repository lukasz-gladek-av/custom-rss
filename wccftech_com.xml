			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">The Nintendo Switch 2</a> will obviously not be able to offer the same visual quality as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but so far, it's been shown that it is doing a pretty good job of turning in PS4-level visuals with some select enhancements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcasts, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> compared the gameplay footage of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Hogwarts Legacy, and Elden Ring running on Nintendo Switch shown during last week's Direct with PlayStation 4 footage, highlighting some interesting findings.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 is comparable to the PlayStation 4 version in terms of resolution and general image quality, but the game benefits from the lighting changes introduced in the Intergrade version, which is not available on Sony's previous-generation console, resulting in much better visuals in some scenarios. Hogwarts Legacy's case is even more interesting, as the game looks somewhat better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on PlayStation 4 with a much sharper and less aliased image despite the lower resolution, 720p vs 1080 upscaled with AMD FSR 1, which suggests that the Switch 2 version may be using a different temporal upscaling solution that returns better image quality.</p>
<p>Of the three games, Elden Ring on Nintendo Switch 2 is the game that looks the closest to the PlayStation 4 version, sporting a similar resolution and only slightly higher shadow drawing distance, although the comparison was limited by the bad quality footage available and the difficulty of recreating similar shots. These early comparisons not only highlight how the upcoming console can deliver PS4-level visuals but also how it can deliver better ones, not only because of more modern hardware but also because late ports give the developers the chance to make different choices that can lead to better results, as the Alien Isolation Switch port highlighted a while back by sporting a different image treatment with TAA over the other console versions which delivered better image quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver significantly better experiences in multiplatform ports than base PlayStation 4 thanks to the console's 120 Hz screen. Up until now, 40 FPS modes and HDR support have been considered as some sort of "bonus" modes since 120 Hz panels with HDR support are not standardized, but the Nintendo Switch 2 screen does, meaning that it's very likely we will see 40 FPS modes and HDR support frequently in games. With the console potentially being used more in handheld mode, the 120 Hz is a massive boon, as more advanced ports will have a hard time hitting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution, making a 720p resolution game running at 40 FPS in handheld mode a much better experience than running at 30 FPS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-act-two-expansion-mod-showcased-in-teaser-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Thanks to Larian's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release official mod tools for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, several interesting custom campaigns are currently being worked on. One of them, called Act Two Expansion, has received an intriguing teaser trailer from its creator, SquallyDaBeanz.</p>
<p>According to the modder, Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion adds a whole new region to the game that players can access between Acts 2 and 3. The area includes new areas, dungeons, encounters, items, secrets, puzzles, and lore. The mod aims to provide a whole new region to experience, similar in scope to the Wilderness of Act 1. It is meant to be sandboxy, focusing on combat and exploration rather than story. There will be some new notes, though, expanding on the lore of this region.</p>
<p>The mod takes place after the player leaves the Shadow Cursed Lands but before you reach Baldur's Gate. With the Absolute's army on the march, the main character and their party must find a way to cross the Chionthar River before taking part in an epic battle against the Absolute's army at Rivington.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion is balanced for level 8–10 characters. According to its creator, most mods should be compatible with it, except for those that modify the Shadow Cursed Lands levels and/or level templates. Multiplayer, on the other hand, should be perfectly supported as long as everyone in the group has it installed.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 supports cross-platform mods, but the creator says this mod wouldn't pass the approval process for consoles, so do not expect to find it there. The current goal is to release it before the end of the year.</p>

<p>You can follow the development of the mod <a href="https://www.patreon.com/SquallyDaBeanz?utm_medium=unknown&amp;utm_source=join_link&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=copyLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on SquallyDaBeanz's Patreon</a>. The modder is also working on Forsaken, a custom Baldur's Gate 3 campaign that seeks to recreate World of Warcraft's undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. A teaser level is already available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>.</p>

			<p>Mistfall Hunter, an upcoming dark fantasy PvPvE extraction action RPG, is continuing its journey to launch. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last October during an Xbox Partner Preview event, the game will soon open up for a second beta test on Steam.</p>
<p>The developer from Bellring Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the second CBT will begin on April 22, 2025, at 01:00 UTC. They also shared plenty of details on the new content and feature additions that players can expect there.</p>
<p>A new class called Reverent Seer will be available to select. These characters use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class in Mistfall Hunter with support capabilities. They can also summon supportive runes called Rune Pillars for healing, shielding, and stealth. There are offensive runes, too, that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies. Furthermore, they're even equipped with a death-prevention spell, which can be incredibly helpful when used at the right time.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta Test will introduce a vast new region north of Brandrgarde. The Forge, where Master Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to the craftsmen and laborers who have become the Corroded alongside its eternal furnace fires. The developer said that Brandrgarde would simply be too large with these new areas, so they have split the entire fortress into two maps. You'll be placed in one of these two at random in each session.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mistfall Hunter now supports Solo Mode as well. The maps are the same, though Bellring changed the placement of monsters to accommodate for the different gameplay compared to Trio Mode. Speaking of monsters, there are some new foes to fight: the Warden, the Prison Guard, the Nightwatcher, and the Penitent.</p>
<p>After collecting enough resources, it'll also be possible to upgrade&nbsp;various features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, increased Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. In addition, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage facility, which is helpful when playing multiple classes.</p>
<p>There's more: class balance, progression tweaks, performance improvements (including lowered system requirements), and brand new features such as a Friends system, a Fill Team system, an in-game emote system, a Journey system, and real-time voice chat have been added to this new build.</p>
<p>Mistfall Hunter does not have a release date yet, but it is slated to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
