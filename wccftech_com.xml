			<p>Mafia: The Old Country arrived on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC a week ago at the time of this writing, and according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">new report from data firm Sensor Tower</a>, Hangar 13's latest entry in the series has sold more than <strong>800K copies</strong> in its first week.</p>



<p>That figure is across all platforms, but according to Sensor Tower, 48% of those copies were sold on PlayStation. </p>



<p>"<em>The robust early sales underline the enduring appeal of the Mafia IP and validate the studio’s choice to deliver a linear, narrative-driven experience with cinematic presentation</em>," writes Sensor Tower on LinkedIn.</p>



<p>"<em>The stronger performance on PlayStation may reflect the platform’s strategic alignment with story-focused single-player games.</em>"</p>



<p>Some other first-week stats shared by Hangar 13 show that players have already "<em>dispatched</em>" more than 185 million in-game enemies, and fired over 600 million shots.</p>

<p>It's all together a good start for the game, though we'll see if 2K and Hangar 13 will be able to keep up the momentum going forward. The studio is already working to add requested features from players, as Hangar 13 also confirmed that the ability to 'Free Ride' in the map is on its way, along with "<em>new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Mafia: The Old Country for us, </a>and enjoyed his time with it, despite not being able to explore the Sicilian countryside as much as he would have liked, writing in his review, "<em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot."</em></p>

			<p>Crimson Desert developer and publisher Pearl Abyss has debuted a new 13-minute gameplay video showcasing a snippet of what Gamescom 2025 attendees will get a chance to play in the coming week.</p>



<p>The action-adventure game was delayed just days prior to this new gameplay drop, pushing the game into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">first quarter of Pearl Abyss' FY2026</a>. It's the game's second major delay, as it was initially meant to arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">sometime earlier this year</a> after a demo showcase at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and then when that didn't happen, it was supposed to release sometime in fall 2025.</p>



<p>Now, of course, we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on it unless you'll be at Gamescom 2025, where you'll get to play the sections featured in this video and a bit more.</p>



<p>This gameplay showcase features a look at a few moments of narrative and exploration, but the highlight of the video is the extended look at combat, including a boss fight towards the back-half of the video.</p>



<p>At this point in the game's story, Crimson Desert's protagonist, Greymane Kliff, and his companions are ambushed, narrowly surviving the attack before Kliff has to take on the boss you'll see in the video, Cassius Morten.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Crimson Desert was first revealed all the way back in 2019, and with its release now set for sometime next year, it'll potentially be seven years from its reveal to its release. </p>



<p>At least it appears to be worth the wait, if the final gameplay experience is as polished as these gameplay videos make it seem. Hopefully, we'll have a proper release date to look forward to soon.</p>
