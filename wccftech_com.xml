			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment made sure that players will have the opportunity to start most quests in multiple ways. Obsidian's Environment Region Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/almost-every-quest-in-rpg-avowed-can-be-started-in-multiple-ways-we-want-to-just-constantly-foster-that-sense-of-exploration-wanderlust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this in an interview with GamesRadar.</p>
<p><em>I think almost every, if not every, quest in the game has it more than one way to start it. You can do things out of order and pick up items and give them to people that want them, or kill a character or whatever, like, you can play things out of order. You can come at a dungeon or vice versa, from a different direction than you normally would. And we want you to be able to do that just based on however you naturally progress through the world. We want to just constantly foster that sense of exploration, wanderlust and just getting lost pleasantly.</em></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview with Avowed</a>, I didn't notice this. However, it's entirely possible I may have simply missed it, as there weren't that many quests to begin with. It's certainly great to be able to start quests in any order - for example, if you happen to find a quest item before you've picked up the quest, you can complete it right away.</p>
<p>That said, after playing around three hours of the game, I feel it best to temper expectations: this isn't an open world that lets you explore as much as something like The Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. However, there is definitely some room for exploration, even in the starting area. Ritger had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that one of the trademarks of roleplaying games is missable content. It makes them special, as players feel like they're rewarded for exploring the game world thoroughly.</p>
<p>Avowed is slated to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was delayed merely to give it more space out of the busy Holiday season, while the game itself was largely complete.</p>

			<p>As of today, the co-op update for Forever Skies is officially out and will allow players to group up in teams of four to explore the vast world that the game has to offer. All PC players will be able to play together with the co-op update, where you can work together to gather supplies, fight for survival, and help build up a fully customizable airship to help each other survive on the toxic, post-apocalyptic Earth. For those interested in the game, Far From Home is offering a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-time discount</a> on Forever Skies on Steam until January 2.</p>
<p>Of course, co-op is not the only thing that has been added to this game, as they have taken player feedback to heart and have reworked some of the key elements in the game, as well as added new content to keep it fresh and exciting for anyone who is joining the game in Early Access. As Early Access continues, new features will be added to the game. For the latest update, that, of course, includes co-op. Also, the gameplay loop has been overhauled in terms of survival, progression, and exploration, allowing players to get a fresh experience that doesn't cause them to feel too samey after playing the game for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | World Evolved &amp; Co-op Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHq8D-gxoWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make that possible, they have made substantial world layout redesigns, including overhauled location designs. There will now also be dynamic random encounters to keep you on your toes, whether you're surviving by yourself or teaming up with friends. There are now new additional enemy threats as well that you will have to learn to fight off to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy easter eggs from other games, you'll be able to discover new artifacts that have themed items from Planet Crafter, Pacific Drive, Frostpunk 2, and Medieval Dynasty as a fun little addition to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't all that has been added to the game, as there are also new tools and devices that the players can research and build for themselves, which will allow new ways to progress through the game. This includes new resources that you'll be able to utilize in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>"Launching co-op mode is a huge milestone for us. Forever Skies was built with an emphasis on immersion and exploration, and we believe that experiencing this world with friends adds a new layer of excitement and depth," says Andrzej Blumenfeld, Creative Director at Far From Home.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available on PC, with a single-player demo available to play now on PlayStation 5. Forever Skies is s<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">et to launch from Early Access in early 2025</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
