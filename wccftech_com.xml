			<p>Powered by NVIDIA technology, Nintendo Switch 2 games can leverage RTX tech like<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/"> NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing </a>to deliver better visuals and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">enhanced image quality at solid performance.</a> Since launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">Nintendo's own titles had yet to take advantage of either,</a> but it seems like the ray tracing floodgates have been opened by the publisher's latest first-party title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>As confirmed by a screenshot of the game's license readme found in the Nintendo Switch 2's menu <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-is-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-support-ray-tracing-specifically-ray-traced-global-illumination.1358995/">shared on ResetERA</a>, Kirby Air Riders reportedly uses the RTXGI SDK, meaning that the racing game uses ray-traced global illumination in some capacity, making it the first proper Nintendo first-party game to do so.</p>



<p>While it's not yet known how Kirby Air Riders implements ray-traced global illumination, this is a very interesting find in light of how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the game. According to our own Nathan Birch, the game not only looks gorgeous, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">runs at a smooth 60 FPS even when the tracks become utterly chaotic</a>. As such, it will be interesting to see how this is achieved, and whether any upscaling technology, such as the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-nvidia-dlss-types-nintendo-switch-2/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, is also utilized to deliver the excellent image quality and solid performance the game exhibits at launch.</p>



<p>Although Kirby Air Riders is reportedly the first proper Nintendo game to use ray tracing in some capacity, this isn't the first time we could be witnessing ray tracing on Nintendo Switch 2. Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world game developed by Ubisoft based on the popular franchise, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">also makes ample use of ray tracing</a>. Future third-party releases, such as Resident Evil Requiem, will likely utilize ray tracing in some capacity as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">judging from currently available footage</a></p>

			<p>The price will be the critical factor that will determine the success of the Steam Machine, but those who expected the upcoming system to be priced in the same range as a console will likely be disappointed, judging from some new information shared online.</p>



<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnKy4UEdiyo&amp;t=2s">In the latest episode of Linus Tech Tips' WAN Show podcast</a>, Linus commented on the yet-to-be-revealed price for the system. While he doesn't know the price (as no one does yet), there are strong indications the system won't fall in the $500 price range of the current PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X systems, judging from the reaction of Valve's employees during a recent media event to show the system to press and creators.</p>



<p><em>"When I said I'm disappointed it isn't going to follow a console pricing model, where its subsided by the fact that manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product, they asked what I meant by console price and I said $500. Nobody said anything, but the energy in the room wasn't great,"</em> Linus said during the podcast.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Valve said that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Steam Machine will be priced competitively with a PC of similar specs</a>, expecting a gaming PC in a console form factor to cost as much as a console is definitely a little unreasonable. As such, what happened at Valve's headquarters, as reported by Linus, shouldn't surprise anyone, especially in light of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/">now expected massive RAM price increase</a> that will impact a wide range of hardware, including gaming hardware.</p>



<p>However, despite Valve believing that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/">a bigger game library will ensure the Steam Machine is more successful than its predecessors</a> and that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/">it will offer a better gaming experience than 70% of current gaming rigs</a>, pricing still needs to be right for the system to be successful. While it is true <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">it may have a hard time delivering a 4K@60 FPS gaming experience even with AMD FSR</a>, those who want to have a hassle-free gaming experience in the vein of consoles won't look at the system twice if it's priced too high, especially in the current climate where the price of living continues to rise worldwide.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new GeForce Hotfix display driver, version 581.94. This is based on the latest GeForce Game Ready driver, version 581.80, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched around two weeks ago</a> with day-one optimizations for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Europa Universalis V, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<p>Following that Game Ready driver, users reported lower performance in some PC games after updating to Windows 11 October 2025 KB5066835 [5561605]. This GeForce hotfix driver resolves the issue, so if you've experienced that, you should download it right away. Otherwise, the fix will be rolled into the next Game Ready driver, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The fight between Krafton, the Korean company behind games like TERA, PUBG, and inZOI, and the founders of Unknown Worlds Entertainment (developers of Subnautica) continues even outside of court.</p>



<p>This morning, Krafton shared two files with the press. One of them is the sworn testimony of Unknown Worlds founder Chris Cleveland in the Delaware court, and the other is a document written by Cleveland as 'litigation help' while he prepared for the legal battle. Cleveland himself submitted the document into evidence, and now Krafton has underlined that several of his comments demonstrated racist views toward Korea and its people, as well as the unwavering conviction that the Korean developer would ultimately be seen as the 'villain' of this story. Here are a few excerpts:</p>



<p><em>Korea - they are the Joe Pesci of countries. Charming until they're incredible nasty. It goes to 11 quickly. No filter.</em></p>



<p><em>It can be emotionally draining dealing with this, especially as male westerners. [<span>Korean, seems to be implied</span>] Males might be more problem-solvers and bring less emotion - they're biological reasons for this. Making games is about problem solving.</em></p>



<p><em>Korea has been surrounded by enemies who want to kill them. They are fighters. It's small and nasty. Every year some big film star commits suicide because of sex, drugs, or something, hounded by press.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware will say this is a bunch of sadistic Korean assholes (like Samsung - John Pleasance). They've cast as out as villains and it's done.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware? Oh, they're fucked. You don't even need a Korean lawyer. History will remember that Krafton was bad. Even the Reddit crowd hates them because of Dark and Darker.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re playing the house’s money and we’re the home team. We don’t need to worry about these guys or our reputation. History will remember that Krafton was bad.</em></p>



<p>In the testimony, Cleveland admitted to saying last year that Unknown Worlds was no longer a place he really wanted to work at, and also that he was 'semi-retired' and only working on the Subnautica movie in some capacity. For their part, Krafton noted that he is now instead looking at being reinstated, and Cleveland replied that he is 'fired up now'.</p>



<p>It all started on July 2, when Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the original Unknown Worlds studio leadership</a> (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire). The fired founders <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed the company purposely delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying them a $250 million bonus</a>, but the South Korean developer eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that it was them who wanted to rush an unfinished version of the game out to get the payment, after neglecting their duties.</p>



<p>Since then, accusations have flown left and right. Just two days ago, it came to light that Krafton CEO Changham Kim <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had asked ChatGPT</a> if there was some way to avoid paying the three their big bonus. This came just days after the South Korean developer announced its shift toward being an 'AI-first company'.</p>



<p>Today's is likely to be one of many chapters in this controversial story. Stay tuned as we continue to cover it. For the record, Krafton did share a tidbit today about Subnautica 2's ongoing development:</p>



<p><em>We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.</em></p>
