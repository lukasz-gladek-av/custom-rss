			<p>Yesterday, modder <strong>Halk Hogan</strong> shared the second video preview of his <strong>The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition 2026</strong> mod. This new version of the popular visual remastering mod, which enhances thousands of the original game's assets, including textures, models, materials, and more, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-2026-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced two months ago</a>. </p>



<p>As usual, Halk Hogan also shared a brief message with the community, revealing what he'll be focusing on for this new version:</p>



<p><em>I'm back to share some fresh progress on the HDRP NextGen Edition. As you can see in the video, many objects will no longer be static and will now have wind simulation. All characters will also be reworked, along with all armor and equipment for Geralt and Roach; everything will now be much more detailed. Of course, this is just a small part of all the changes that will be included in The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition 2026, which will be available later this year.</em></p>

<p>It might just be a very timely release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-the-witcher-3-dlc-rumors-intensify-more-polish-websites-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to growing rumors</a>, <strong>CD Projekt RED is secretly preparing a new DLC</strong> for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, ten years after the release of <strong>Blood and Wine</strong>. Speculation is that it will somehow bridge the previous game with the upcoming The Witcher 4. IGN Poland previously heard that the studio was interested in introducing the Eastern realm of Zerrikania, though they acknowledged that the Northern kingdom of Kovir and Poviss might also be an option for the DLC.</p>



<p>If you just can't wait for either thing to release and want to play the game now, you can find the current The Witcher 3 HDRP NextGen Edition <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Warning: the download is around 12GB.  </p>

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Valve</strong>'s leading PC games distribution platform, <strong>Steam</strong>, reached a new user concurrency record. As <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/2010358139128836285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed by SteamDB</a>, at 14:00 UTC, Steam surpassed <strong>42 million concurrent users</strong>.</p>



<p>The previous record (41.6 million users) <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set in October 2025</a>, but the platform has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now:</p>

<p>A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5% per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5% in a single year, followed by a stabilization phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9% and 12.6% annual growth rate, well above the pre-COVID trajectory.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Period</th><th>Start</th><th>End</th><th>Growth</th><th>% Growth</th><th>Annual Growth Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pre-COVID</strong></td><td>Nov 2017 → Feb 2020</td><td>17.6M</td><td>20.0M</td><td>+2.4M</td><td>+13.6%</td><td>+4.5%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>COVID</strong></td><td>Mar 2020 → Feb 2021</td><td>20.0M</td><td>26.3M</td><td>+6.3M</td><td>+31.5%</td><td>+31.5%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Post-COVID</strong></td><td>Mar 2021 → Oct 2022</td><td>25.0M</td><td>30.0M</td><td>+5.0M</td><td>+20.0%</td><td>+13.9%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beyond COVID</strong></td><td>Nov 2022 → Jan 2026</td><td>30.0M</td><td>42.0M</td><td>+12.0M</td><td>+40.0%</td><td>+12.6%/year</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><span>Notably, unlike the&nbsp;<strong>Epic Games Store</strong>, which also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://game-experience.it/epic-games-store-gli-utenti-sono-cresciuti-del-173-in-sei-anni-ma-la-crescita-dei-ricavi-si-e-fermata-all16/" target="_blank">experienced significant user growth (+173% over six years) but failed to increase</a></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://game-experience.it/epic-games-store-gli-utenti-sono-cresciuti-del-173-in-sei-anni-ma-la-crescita-dei-ricavi-si-e-fermata-all16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> third-party game sales revenue (only +1.6%)</a>, Steam is also meaningfully growing its revenue. According to estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared last week by Alinea Analytics</a>, <strong>December 2025 was the best December yet for Steam</strong>, with the platform generating <strong>over $1.6 billion last month.</strong> This represented a 22.7% increase over December 2024 and comfortably beat the gross revenue of $1.4 billion generated by Steam in December 2020 during the height of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Long story short: Valve owner Gabe Newell might soon be able to celebrate with <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another superyacht</a>, because why not?</p>
