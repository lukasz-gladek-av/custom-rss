			<p>Amid the sea of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> news, there was also the <a href="https://x.com/ShinenGames/status/1907437680037646517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of FAST Fusion, a new entry in the zero-G racing series developed by Shin'en Multimedia, which will be a launch title for the new console. Interestingly, the previous installment (FAST RMX) was also a launch title for the first Switch. Then, the independent German developer did something with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Touryst</a>, an action/adventure game launched in 2020 on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>With FAST Fusion, the developer returns to creating exclusive games for a new Nintendo console, and it appears that they'll take full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2's capabilities. Here's an overview of the features confirmed by the studio:</p>
<p><strong><em>Hypersonic Speed</em></strong><br>
<em>The fastest racing game you may have ever experienced! Non stop adrenaline pumping action at 60 fps in up to 4K HDR.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Antigravity Jumps</em></strong><br>
<em>FAST Fusion vehicles are equipped with antigravity hyper jump technology. Cut corners and get ahead of your oppenents by jumping and boosting over them.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Vehicle Fusion</em></strong><br>
<em>Create hundreds of new Racing machines by fusing your favorite vehicles.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Hyper tracks</em></strong><br>
<em>Zoom through Redwood Forest, Alpine peaks, futuristic cities and many more breathtaking landscapes.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Motion Controls, HD Rumble</em></strong><br>
<em>Play with smooth motion controls, enjoy immersive HD Rumble and customize the buttons.</em></p>
<p>FAST Fusion will also support split-screen play for up to four players, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Game Share feature (both locally and online), TV Mode, Tabletop Mode, Handheld Mode, and, of course, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tariffs announced by Donald Trump will drastically impact a number of industries across the world, and video games are in no way excluded. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-supply-chains-hit-with-up-to-a-46-percent-trump-tariffs/">Apple's</a> supply chain issues might not matter as much to gamers, what they likely care more about is the potential the tariffs have to raise the already high price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo revealed its new console in an hour-long Nintendo Direct event on Wednesday, with the price of the console and the new games we'll be playing on it revealed immediately after. It'll be $449.99 USD if you want to just buy the console, or $499.99 USD to grab the bundle that includes the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-moves-some-switch-production-to-vietnam">2019</a>, Nintendo moved part of its hardware manufacturing out of China and into Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time, though it certainly looked like it, Nintendo stated that the move was not done as a means of avoiding tariffs during disputes between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The tariffs Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/trump-says-he-s-signing-executive-order-on-reciprocal-tariffs">announced later on Wednesday</a>, just hours after Nintendo's presentation, include a <strong>46%</strong> tariff levied against Vietnam and a <strong>49%</strong> tariff levied against Cambodia, both of which could end up impacting the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 on a global scale.</p>
<p>Trump also announced a base 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, 2025, while countries facing higher tariffs, like Cambodia and Vietnam, will have their tariffs go into effect on April 9, 2025. The 10% base tariff is also not being added to the ones Cambodia and Vietnam already face.</p>
<p>Unless some kind of deal is reached, including a lower tariff or an exception to certain exports to the United States, there's a very good chance the cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 could go higher than it already is.</p>
