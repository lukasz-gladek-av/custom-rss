			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler has made some nice progress lately, so much so that it now reportedly always delivers better image quality than TAA, temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa-rtgi-shader-compilation-taa-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> regarding the revamped version of the Anvil Engine that powers Assassin's Creed Shadows, Engine Technical architects Nicolas Lopez and Pierre Fortin and Project Lead Programmer Rendering Sébastien Daigneault commented on why the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game currently doesn't support the PSSR upscaler, saying that, at the time of shipping the game, they found better results with TAA.</p>
<p>However, after an in-depth collaboration with Sony over the past few months, many issues have been addressed, especially regarding moving vegetation and water, issues that have been found in other games as well. As such, PSSR now always delivers better image quality than TAA, and support will be added in the future. Alongside PSSR support, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will also get ray-traced reflections in Balanced Mode, providing better visuals at a higher framerate than Quality Mode.</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly looks great on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's visuals truly shine on PC, especially on system configurations that can handle all the ray tracing features the game has to offer. Even without all the bells and whistles, the latest entry in the series is definitely worth playing for fans of the franchise's open-world RPG approach, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review</a>.</p>
