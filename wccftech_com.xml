			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will receive its reveal trailer on Thursday, July 24 at 8 AM Pacific Time/11 AM Eastern Time/5 PM Central European Time. The trailer's official tagline is:</p>



<p><em>Prepare for the ultimate all-out warfare experience in Battlefield 6.</em></p>



<p>A few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got word</a> from insiders and content creators that a reveal event was on the way. Yesterday, some enterprising users <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that DICE and EA are preparing an Open Beta to go live in early August, providing players with the first public hands-on experience with Battlefield 6.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Granted, a few lucky Battlefield Labs testers already got their hands on the game in the past few months. Several videos even <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked out</a>, showing promising content and features for the next iteration in the military shooter IP.</p>



<p>Back in April, the development teams (of which there are four dedicated to Battlefield 6: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect Studios) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> about the renewed importance of destructibility in the game, which will allow players to shape the environment to their needs to gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, rubble will stay on the map, potentially becoming useful for cover and protection.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Battlefield 6 will also include a full-fledged single-player campaign. Motive Studios is handling this story, which will be thematically <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by movies like Civil War and TV shows like Lioness.</p>



<p>The hype for this reveal is certainly enormous among fans, especially after the disappointing Battlefield 2042. Publisher Electronic Arts also has massive expectations, with rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing</a> to a $400 million budget that EA hopes will be recouped and more with a target 100 million player base.</p>



<p>EA previously said the game would launch within this fiscal year, but if there really is an Open Beta coming in the next couple of weeks, the release date may be relatively soon. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the official Battlefield 6 details on July 24.</p>

			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still happening; but release may have slipped a touch later than originally planned. Will update when I can.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1947449269893665134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

			<p>Supermassive Games released a statement in which it confirmed that the studio has laid off 36 people, cuts that it says were made for the studio to "<em>adapt our team structure to better align</em>" with the changes and challenges of the video game industry. The studio also confirmed that Directive 8020, which was due to launch this October, has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>The statement was published to the<a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211"> studio's official X account</a>, where it writes "<em>This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected</em>."</p>



<p>Directive 8020, which was announced last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">Gamescom 2024</a>, and was supposed to be out this coming October 2, 2025, will now release sometime in "<em>the first half of 2026</em>." Supermassive adds "<em>the response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Directive 8020 wasn't the only game Supermassive had launching in October of this year though, with the other being <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a>, which is due out on October 10, 2025, and only gets a short mention at the end of the statement, where Supermassive claims that these layoffs have "<em>no impact on the development of Little Nightmares III</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/">February 2024</a>, Supermassive Games laid off a third of its staff, once again citing challenges in the changing video game industry. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod-makes-main-character-react-dynamically-to-the-world-improving-immersion.1249791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online a few days back makes the experience more immersive than ever before, introducing some choice improvements to main character V's behavior.</p>



<p>As the name implies, the More Responsive V mod, now available for download for free from Nexus Mod, makes the game's main character react more dynamically to the world. With the mod, V will respond vocally to being bumped, hit by vehicles, and in a lot of other scenarios where a voiced reaction is expected, such as stealing vehicles, MaxTac's arrival, and more. With the mod, which uses unused voice lines that seem to have been created specifically for similar scenarios, V will also respond to Johnny Silverhand's comments while driving in a vehicle. You can check out the mod in action by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyNvkZuaNE">video</a>.</p>



<p>Despite having been released almost five years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 is still receiving plenty of love from CD Projekt Red and modders alike. A new 2.3 patch went live <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">last week</a>, introducing new content and features on all platforms, such as AMD FSR 4, FSR 3.1 Frame Generation support on PC and proper VRR support on consoles. The introduction of VRR support, according to Digital Foundry, is the closest we will get to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vrr-support-closest-to-official-ps5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patch.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
