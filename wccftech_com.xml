			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption comparison shared online a few hours ago highlights the differences between the PC and console versions of Rockstar Games' glorious open-world game, which finally made its debut on PC 14 years after its original release.</p>
<p>The comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geracaopowerup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geração Power Up</a> puts the PC version of the game side by side with the Switch and the Xbox 360 versions of the game, highlighting how the biggest improvement is the higher resolution, which returns a sharp image quality over the other versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption - Graphics Comparison (PC, X360 &amp; SWITCH) | 4K ULTRA HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qQqnp3l8hE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption being essentially the same on PC as it is on consoles, at the very least, ensures it runs well on a variety of system configurations. An RTX 4070 GPU, for example, is capable of running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS at playable framerates, as highlighted in a new video by MxBenchmarkPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption PC | RTX 4070 8K, 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjk6a9CTrEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To see proper visual improvements in Red Dead Redemption PC, we will have to wait for mods. A stunning visual overhaul called <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Redemption</a> will soon be released for the new version of the game, bringing improvements such as better reflection quality, draw distance for vegetation and map, particles and particle count, and more.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>
