			<p>Warhorse Studios announced that Kingdom Come Deliverance II has received another major free update, version 1.2. Its highlights are the addition of native mod integration through Steam Workshop support and the new barber feature.</p>
<p>The former will allow players to more easily download and install mods into the game rather than jump through various hoops <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they had to do until now</a>. The caveat is, of course, that the mod has to be available on Steam Workshop. At the time of writing, there are only four mods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412838982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Saving</a> provides the player with a Saviour Schnapps item every time they use or lose one, effectively providing infinite saving.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442455418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helmet of Henry VIII</a> adds a horned helmet for Henry to wear.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442495480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tourist</a> disables NPC reactions to trespassing, opening up several story places that would normally be inaccessible.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440052578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pebbles the Zebra</a> visually transforms Henry's horse into a zebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the modding section will undoubtedly soon be populated with many more mods. Right now, there are over a thousand Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods available on Nexus. While it is unlikely the Steam Workshop section will ever be just as big, several mods should be on both platforms soon.</p>
<p>Henry can also now go to a barber NPC in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg to get a haircut and optionally also pick a new beard style. Regardless of the actual choice, going to a barber will temporarily buff Henry's Charisma stat.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update is much bigger than just those two features, though, as you can glean from scrolling through the lengthy patch notes article <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's website</a>. Warhorse says it introduces more than a thousand between fixes and improvements to nearly every aspect of the game. A lot of that has to do with balancing, but there are also enhancements to various animations and NPC behaviors, such as the crime system, which should now be more accurate. The daily NPCs schedules have been fine-tuned, and there are improvements to horse riding, horse trading, character visuals, and performance, especially in Kuttenberg (the largest city in Kingdom Come Deliverance II) and the biggest battles.</p>
<p>Warhorse plans to discuss all of these tweaks in greater detail during a developer stream next Thursday. The studio won't stop working on the game, either, given that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the 2025 roadmap</a>, three premium DLCs are coming in spring, summer, and winter. The excellent open world roleplaying game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in its first two weeks and the Czech studio certainly wants to ride that success as much as possible.</p>

			<p>Almost 400,000 Nintendo Switch 2 units have reportedly been shipped already to North America, making the rumored early summer release window quite likely.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jabapg/about_383000_switch_2_units_have_reportedly_been/">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>,<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4137#post-1656320"> Famiiboards</a> forums member LiC recently discovered by tracking shipments of cartons and instruction manuals that Vietnamese manufacturer HVBG was contracted by Nintendo and has already shipped 383,000 Nintendo Switch 2 units to North America in late January for distribution in the United States and Canada, which is a significant number of units, considering they are only part of the initial shipment number which is sure to be bigger by the time the console launches later this year. With so many units already being shipped by January, it definitely feels like the console will indeed launch in early summer, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> for a while.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the day we will learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide and what exactly it will be capable of is not too far away. On April 2nd, Nintendo will host a Nintendo Direct focused on the system, finally lifting the lid on a system that has been in the works and reportedly ready for launch for a very long time, so much so that even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">people at NVIDIA were surprised</a> it was taking this long to release.</p>
