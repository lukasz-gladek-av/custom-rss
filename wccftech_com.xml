			<p>In just two days, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully revealed in its very own Nintendo Direct. Fans have been eagerly anticipating any information about the upcoming console, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">rumors</a> flying wildly. Some have been relatively tame and logical, while others have been completely outlandish.</p>
<p>One of the more recent rumors is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in one way or another. Previous rumors that were announced suggested that this resolution will be available when the console is docked, and that the resolution in handheld will be 1080p.</p>
<p>There have now been recent claims that there won't be 4K support, as the dev kits for the Nintendo Switch 2 don't contain any support for 4K resolution. This news comes from the Game Developers Conference (GDC) that took place in San Francisco earlier in March.</p>
<p>"I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email, but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don't have a 4K output," says Tom Henderson during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>. Whether this is true or not is yet to be confirmed by those who have access to the dev kits, but it's also likely that they are unable to confirm anything until Nintendo gives them permission to.</p>
<p>Although a dev kit may not have 4K output, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Nintendo Switch 2 won't support 4K output. Console development kits don't typically match the specifications of the final system, and there is a possibility that a newer dev kit will be released with this potential.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't about the Nintendo Switch 2, based solely on the little information that is available across the internet. Luckily, the Direct is just around the corner, where we will hopefully find out the specifications, extra features, and price tag of the console. It's uncertain whether any games will be announced during this Direct or whether it will be focused solely on the console itself.</p>
<p>This console comes with new Joy-Cons, which look like they will be more stable overall compared to the first console. Hopefully, a lot of questions will be answered about what to expect from this console for both developers and consumers. Just three days ago, there was a leak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/">US retailer documents</a> that showed the potential pre-order plans, with an expected date for pre-orders opening to be April 9.</p>
