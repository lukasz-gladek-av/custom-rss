			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-team17-future-games-show-gamescom-2025/">was announced this summer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, with publisher Team17 and Expression Games bringing its brand of strategic shooter gameplay to a new setting following its initial World War II setting. </p>



<p>Today, Expression Games and Team17 put out a new gameplay trailer, after the more cinematic-focused trailer shown at Gamescom as part of the game's reveal. The trailer shows off a 50v50 battle in this "<em></em><em>war with no front lines</em>" setting.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six Vietnam maps, including dense jungles to fight through, and some more open and clear battlefields to offer strategic variety in how each match can be approached. You'll be able to hop in a helicopter and deploy troops at different points on the battlefield, take control of patrol boats for a small slice of naval combat, and North Vietnam forces can use a tunnel system to move around the maps for surprise attacks and strategic advantages against American troops.</p>

<p>One thing the trailer did not include, however, was a release date, as we're still just looking at a 2026 release window. A press release for the trailer does make it clear that this is in-engine gameplay footage, however, so hopefully, this look at gameplay is a sign that we're not too far off from when a release date will be revealed.</p>



<p>Expression Games has already made it clear that it will continue to support Hell Let Loose once Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is in the public's hands, though a difference worth noting between the two titles is that there's currently no indication that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be an early access release like Hell Let Loose before it.</p>



<p>It appears that Expression Games is just ready to release Vietnam as a full 1.0 version. Hopefully, whenever it launches, it'll feel like a full and finished product.</p>

			<p>It's been exactly five years since CD Projekt RED released Cyberpunk 2077. Today, the Polish studio is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its most recent game with a series of initiatives, including a special trailer looking back on the emotional story experienced by the protagonist, V, and the players while in the City of Legends.</p>



<p>It's been a whirlwind for sure, both in and out of the game. Riding on the hype guaranteed by the success of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the biggest digital game launch of all time</a> based on revenue and units (10.2 million units sold), but the game's bugs and performance issues on previous generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) heavily damaged its reputation, especially when Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delisted-from-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the game from the PlayStation Store</a>, a nearly unprecedented move for such a highi-profile game, until the developer fixed the problems.</p>



<p>CD Projekt RED worked very hard to achieve this, eventually delivering a more refined and expanded experience through various updates (particularly with version 2.0) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Fans recognized the improvement, and now Cyberpunk 2077 is once again appreciated. Over the past five years, it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 35 million units</a>, and more will be sold this Holiday season thanks to the heavy discounts (up to 65% off) available now across multiple storefronts. The game also has a sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in development</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cyberpunk 2077 fans can look forward to the newly announced Cyberpunk Trading Card Game, announced in partnership with WeirdCo. As with most TCGs, a crowdfunding campaign will debut on Kickstarter next year. The Cyberpunk TCG will let players assemble the ultimate edgerunner crew comprising characters from across the franchise, pitting them against opponents in a battle to become Night City legends. Featuring custom artwork, Cyberpunk TCG is designed for trading card players, avid collectors and Cyberpunk franchise fans alike.</p>

<p>Several new partnerships and products were also announced as part of the fifth anniversary celebrations, offering players more ways to engage with the world of Cyberpunk 2077. The Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector’s Set is available to pre-order and gives players the chance to get their hands on secret Arasaka tech. Presented in a steel case, it includes a light-up replica of the Relic biochip from the game, a USB thumb drive containing the game's soundtrack, three holographic tarot cards, and two pins. The Collector's Set is available with or without Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition via the CD PROJEKT RED Gear Store.</p>



<p>In partnership with Corsair, an Arasaka Edition <a href="https://fave.co/48HjOR1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyboard</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/4a9YYw6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mouse</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/44gYErQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mousepad</a> have also been made available for pre-order, bringing a touch of the megacorp lifestyle to players' setups.</p>



<p>Brand-new Displates featuring custom artwork inspired by movie posters have also been unveiled, turning iconic Cyberpunk 2077 characters such as Jackie Welles, Panam Palmer, and Adam Smasher into would-be stars. Collectors can <a href="https://fave.co/3MrwfsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase</a> these Displates today.</p>
