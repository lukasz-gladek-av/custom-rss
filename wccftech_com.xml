            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-on-xbox-sells-a-lot-more-than-gears-of-war-reloaded-on-playstation.1288389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, there's already been a PlayStation State of Play for September 2025. It was entirely focused on one game, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">007 First Light,</a> and wasn't exactly what we had in mind when rumors of a September State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">cropped up just weeks ago</a>. However, a new report, this time from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/">Insider-Gaming</a>, claims that there is still another presentation coming later this month that might even feature Marvel's Wolverine from Insomniac. </p>



<p>The long and short of the report is that sources Insider-Gaming spoke to claim that there's another event coming before the month is over, and that will "<em>almost certainly</em>" feature Marvel's Wolverine, which we've not seen hair-nor-adamantium-claw of since its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/">reveal and announcement in 2021</a>.</p>



<p>There's been plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/">leaked information</a> following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/">ransomware attack</a> that Insomniac suffered in 2023, but that information becoming public could have been the key reason for Insomniac changing its plans, so it's good to remember that nothing we saw from those leaks was set in stone.</p>



<p>And while there have been previous claims that Marvel's Wolverine would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker/">shown in the near future</a>, which proved to be wrong, it's worth considering that beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-already-gone-gold/">Ghost of Yotei</a> this October, we don't have a strong picture of what PlayStation Studios has coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>That's not to say that PlayStation and Insomniac have been sitting on Marvel's Wolverine for so long that it'll be ready to go before 2025 is over, just that it wouldn't be crazy to consider that Insomniac is probably getting close to finishing it, now that we're at least four years into the game's development.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is just a rumor, so take it with an appropriate amount of salt. Hopefully, though, for Insomniac fans who would love to see the studio take on other comic book characters that don't swing from webs, we are only weeks away from hearing more about Marvel's tragic self-healing, adamantium-filled Canadian.</p>
