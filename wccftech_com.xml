			<p>The news that <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working on a <strong>God of War Trilogy remake</strong></a> certainly hyped fans, though it will likely be a long while until we get new information from the developer. </p>



<p>Thankfully, actor <strong>Christopher Judge</strong>, who plays <strong>Kratos</strong> in 2018's God of War and 2022's God of War Ragnarök, has kindly shared a few details <a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while speaking to YouTuber Fuzhpuzy</a> at Fan Expo Vancouver this past weekend.</p>



<p>When asked if he would be featured in the God of War Trilogy remake, he predictably replied no, adding that the original actor who played Kratos in those games, <strong>TC Carson</strong>, would reprise the role. That part had already been clarified from the studio, but Judge went on to say that, while not a reboot, <strong>the remakes would feature new technology and a new fighting system</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge also seemingly teased <strong>the reveal of Cory Barlog's next game</strong>:</p>



<p><em>And then you'll be hearing about what we're doing, probably in late Summer.</em></p>



<p>This info lines up perfectly with what two major insiders, <strong>NatetheHate</strong> and <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-creators-next-game-targeting-2027-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared a few days ago</a>: Sony Santa Monica's next title, directed by Cory Barlog, will be revealed in the Summer for a targeted 2027 launch.</p>



<p>Given that Christopher Judge mentioned late Summer, we can probably exclude Summer Game Fest. Potential candidates include <strong>Gamescom</strong> and <strong>PAX Prime</strong>, although the most likely scenario remains <strong>a dedicated State of Play</strong>.</p>



<p>As for what it's going to be, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-60#post-151517563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to another insider</a>, Ashhong from the ResetEra board (who was legitimized by Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>), <strong>this won't be another God of War entry</strong>. However, if you've been following the rumors on Cory Barlog's next game, this shouldn't surprise you; Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported last year</a> that while not based on a new franchise, it would "feel like it", and that definition certainly does not fit the God of War IP.</p>

			<p><strong>Highguard</strong> has become one of the most talked-about games to kick off 2026, but all for the wrong reasons. After its maligned reveal at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, despite its <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">launch drawing <strong>97K</strong> concurrent players </a>on Steam alone, those players didn't stick around, and it lost the vast majority of its player base almost immediately. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">review-bombed on Steam</a>, and barely two weeks after it had arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, "<em>most</em>" of the team at developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">had been <strong>laid off</strong>.</a></p>



<p>After one of the laid-off developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">took to X (formerly Twitter) to call out players</a> who wrote the game off after barely giving it a chance and a new report revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-website-remains-down-fans-worry-this-is-it/">details about the game's funding</a>, the latest development is that some of the laid-off staffers have been given permission to start sharing what they worked on at Wildlight as part of their public portfolios. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concept-art-and-videos-of-completed-highguard-characters-and-wip-map-posted-online-by-ex-staffers.1439296/">ResetEra</a>, Wildlight allowing the former artists to share their work is a good-faith move by the studio, and it gives these artists a better chance to find work by being able to show off these videos and images of currently unreleased characters from the game. That said, the fact that these designs are being released at all raises even more questions about the game's longevity.</p>



<p>Of course, it's possible that the characters shared were concepts that made it far into development, but were ultimately not chosen to be part of any future updates. Though with how things have been going for Highguard so far, seeing unreleased characters appear online in this fashion has players wondering if Wildlilght is allowing them to be shared because the game won't be around long enough for them to be released.</p>



<p>It's definitely not common to see unreleased characters from a live service game that is currently still active, so while the speculation surrounding the release of these images could turn out to be just that, it could also be another sign of Highguard's upcoming shuttering. </p>
