			<p>The three PS Plus Essential-tier games that subscribers can add to their library for free with their subscriptions for July 2025 have been announced, headlined by Diablo IV, and supported by Jusant and King of Fighters XV.</p>
<p>Along with these games being part of PlayStation's monthly routine to add more games to its PS Plus service, they're also part of the company's celebrations for the 15-year anniversary of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/">PlayStation Plus</a>, which launched on June 29, 2010.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>"<em>We hope you can join us for a number of celebratory activities we have planned this summer to commemorate this incredible milestone,</em>" wrote Nick Maguire, vice president of global services, global sales, and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-a-big-thank-you-to-players-for-15-wonderful-years/">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV will all be available for PS Plus subscribers beginning on July 1, though there are more benefits and discounts subscribers can take advantage of this week as part of the PlayStation Plus anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>One of the more notable aspects of the celebrations is that this weekend, June 28-29 will be another free online multiplayer weekend, where all PlayStation players, whether they have a PS Plus subscription or not, will be able to hop online and play with their friends.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits are exclusive to the PS Plus Premium tier, with Premium subscribers getting access to a 15% discount on films available through the Sony Pictures Core app. Premium subscribers also get access to a Monster Hunter Wilds game trial and a WWE 2K25 game trial.</p>
<p>All PS Plus subscribers will get access to a weekend offer of discounts on the PlayStation Store, and be able to download a Valorant PS Plus Pack which includes cosmetics that players can show off in their Valorant matches.</p>
<p>That's all Maguire shared on the PS Blog for now, though there will be more to come throughout the month of July, beyond the announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium-tier monthly additions. Maguire also points players to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/whats-new/#15th">PlayStation Plus section</a> of the PlayStation website to find out more about the 15 year anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>"<em>In the last 15 years we have been focused on providing access to quality game experiences through PlayStation Plus, along with key benefits such as exclusive PlayStation Store discounts, online multiplayer access, Cloud Game Streaming and more. Since the launch of our Monthly Games benefit (previously known as Instant Game Collection), more than 500 monthly games have been offered.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for coming on our PlayStation Plus journey. There's plenty more to look forward to, including many more great games to come</em>."</p>

			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new big patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.5. This update introduces major fixes to the A-Life system, which was kinda broken when STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view. Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.</em></li>
<li><em>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.</em></li>
<li><em>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.</em></li>
<li><em>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are many more bug fixes, tweaks, and technical improvements to performance and Ultra-wide screens, for instance, but arguably the other highlight of STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 is the public release of the modding tool. Called Zone Kit, it is available for download <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a> and will allow users to create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and more. The mods can then be shared via Steam Workshop or <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mod.io</a>. The former page isn't up yet, but Mod.io already has 43 mods listed.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Wccftech that they would add cross-platform mods, multiplayer, and hardware ray tracing post-launch. The first one has been released, and now we're expecting them to focus on delivering the remaining promises made to fans.</p>
