			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>

<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>
